The associate parameter allows us to check if a project has a network without actually associating one.

This allows us to list vpns for projects without associating all of the projects to a network.",

            "content": "Yes, I agree that this parameter allows us to check if a project has a network without associating one, but the issue I found was that it IS associating a new network even when you don't want to, using up the scarce resource.  AuthManager().get_project_vpn_data() should not be associating a new network to the project but it is doing so anyway because the DB API forces the associate parameter to be set to True all the time.\n\nThe call chain is:\n\nAuthManager:\nnetwork_ref = db.project_get_network(context.get_admin_context(), Project.safe_id(project), False)\n => here, authmanager does not want to associate project and network\n\ndb.api:\ndef project_get_network(context, project_id, associate=True):\n    return IMPL.project_get_network(context, project_id)\n => here, associate is accepted but never used in the method.   This is the problematic part.\n\ndb.sqlalchemy.api:\ndef project_get_network(context, project_id, associate=True)\n => here, associate is accepted, and defaults to True,  which means this method tries to associate project and network even if the original caller specifically told it not to.\n\nMy question was, shouldn't db.api.project_get_network pass along the associate parameter to IMPL.project_get_network?  \n\nIt seems strange to me that the behavior of db.api and db.sqlalchemy.api would be different when 'associate' is set to False, and that AuthManager would pass in associate=False parameter only to be overridden to True later.\n\nLet me know what you think!  Thnx.\n  \n",
