I think that it happens because hypervisor reports 'active' status, e.g. KVM reports 'active' status when VM is powered on, it does not matter for KVM what happened inside VM. If my understanding is correct then we should mark it as 'Invalid' (nova maps status from hypervisor, it doesn't go inside VM to check what happened).\n\nKind regards,\nPawel",
