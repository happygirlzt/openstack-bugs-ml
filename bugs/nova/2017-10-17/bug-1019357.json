    "description": "Currently when an instance is delete, a notification is sent out containing instance information. However, there seems to be a few conditions where an instance could be marked as deleted prior to the notification being sent out which causes no instance system metadata to be returned in the notification (or for the notification to not be delivered at all).\n\nSolution: It makes sense to use the read_delete=\"yes\" option here for reading system metadata from an instance you're deleting. This way no matter what the metadata will be able to be retrieved.",

Also, use\n    this to ensure system metadata is always collected during delete,\n    even if the instance was deleted elsewhere.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1019357\n    \n    Change-Id: I9285f110801435344fcaa76ba21fb88c23aac2fa\n",
