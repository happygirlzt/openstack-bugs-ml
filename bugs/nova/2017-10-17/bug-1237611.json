For v3 api instead of\n    stubbing flavors 'create' method stubbed db's 'flavor_create' method.\n    Also removed redundant code of stubbing 'flavor_create' method.\n    \n    For example\n    name = \"  \"              #not allowed\n    name = \"extra large\"     #allowed\n    name = \" extra large \"   #allowed, but leading and trailing whitespaces\n                             #will be trimmed (same as instance name)\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1237611\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie68be299030a878a752dbfdcdfe5094f8427598a\n",
