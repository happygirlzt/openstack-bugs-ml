    "description": "When detaching a volume, Nova doesn't disconnect the iSCSI portal and just return for there are other volumes attaching to the host. But the mutipath mapping device descriptor is there and multipath tool sends IOs periodically to storage array. This leads to some cinder storage drivers, such as huawei, can not unmap that volume for it detect periodic IOs.\n\nSo we need to remove the multipath device descriptor in this case.",
