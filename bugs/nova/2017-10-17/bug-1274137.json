This will result in the compute manager setting task_state to None from 'suspending'.\n\nThis is not good. It's possible for a host to be set to reboot assuming all VMs are in stable states or other Operations on the VM itself may get through for task_state is None.\n\nIt would be good if driver suspend() actually wait for the power_state to move from PAUSED to SHUTOFF and then return control to the manager. This would make sure there are no inconsistent task_states reported.",
