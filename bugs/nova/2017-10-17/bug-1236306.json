Amazon's contributions have been considerable.  They employ me and several other core boto developers.\n\nOur strategic answer for Python 3 support is boto3 which will be as big of a deal to the boto community as Python 3 was to the Python community.  We have laid the ground work for boto3 with botocore which is the low-level library upon which we are building boto3.  It fully supports Python 2.6, Python 2.7, and Python 3.3.  I can't provide a specific timeframe for boto3 but you should start seeing some initial designs and prototypes on github in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, you might want to check out the py3kport branch.  This work was contributed by the community and I know it is being used successfully to run boto in Python 3.x by a number of people.  Or, depending on your requirements, you could also check out botocore.  It provides great low-level coverage across the services.\n\nMitch\n-----------------\n",
