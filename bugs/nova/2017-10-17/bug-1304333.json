    "description": "If a compute manager is stopped / fails during POWERING-ON or POWERING-OFF operations then the instance will be left stuck in a this transitional task_state.\n\n--- --- --- --- --- --- ---\n\n[Impact]\n\n * We are backporting this to Icehouse since nova currently fails to resolve\n   instance state when service is restarted. It is not expected to impact\n   normal operational behaviour in any way.\n\n[Test Case]\n\n * Deploy cloud incl. nova-compute and rabbitmq and create some instances.\n\n * Perform actions on those instances that cause state to change\n\n * Restart nova-compute and once restarted check that nova instances are in\n   expected state.\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\n * None that I can see. This is hopefully a very low impact patch and I have\n   tested in my local cloud environment with successful results.",

The package will build now and be available at http://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova/1:2014.1.4-0ubuntu2.1 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.\n\nPlease help us by testing this new package.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed.  Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.\n\nIf this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested, and change the tag from verification-needed to verification-done. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed.  In either case, details of your testing will help us make a better decision.\n\nFurther information regarding the verification process can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .
