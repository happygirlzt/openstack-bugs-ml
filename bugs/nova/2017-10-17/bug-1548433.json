Any routers in this state are excluded in\n    router retrievals by the L3 agent since they are not yet\n    ready to be wired up.\n    \n    This is necessary when a router is made up of several\n    distinct Neutron resources that cannot all be put\n    into a single transaction. This patch applies this new\n    state to HA routers while their internal HA ports and\n    networks are being created/deleted so the L3 HA agent\n    will never retrieve a partially formed HA router. It's\n    important to note that the ALLOCATING status carries over\n    until after the scheduling is done, which ensures that\n    routers that weren't fully scheduled will not be sent to\n    the agents.\n    \n    An HA router is placed in this state only when it is being\n    created or converted to/from the HA state since this is\n    disruptive to the dataplane.\n    \n    This patch also reverts the changes introduced in\n    Iadb5a69d4cbc2515fb112867c525676cadea002b since they will\n    be handled by the ALLOCATING logic instead.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Ann Kamyshnikova <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: John Schwarz <email address hidden>\n    \n    APIImpact\n    Closes-Bug: #1550886\n    Related-bug: #1499647\n    Change-Id: I22ff5a5a74527366da8f82982232d4e70e455570\n    (cherry picked from commit 9c3c19f07ce52e139d431aec54341c38a183f0b7)\n\ncommit 07401352a964b92ef4bc09a09800554e4a84cc87\nAuthor: Hynek Mlnarik <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Feb 25 11:34:15 2016 +0100\n\n    Cleanup stale OVS flows for physical bridges\n    \n    Perform deletion of the stale flows in physical bridges consistently with\n    br-int and br-tun, respecting drop_flows_on_start configuration option.\n    Added tests for auxiliary bridge and functional tests for the physical\n    bridge using VLAN/flat external network.

Under load (rally test) agents\n    may start \"blinking\" which makes cluster very unstable.\n    \n    In fact there is no need to send and update resource_versions in each state\n    report. I see two cases when it should be done:\n     1) agent was restarted (after it was upgraded);\n     2) agent revived - which means that server was not receiving or being able\n        to process state reports for some time (agent_down_time).
