    "description": "Windows instances aren't configured correctly currently on XenServer due to a reboot during the Sysprep process which causes the XenStore to reload.  Because all of the configuration messages are injected into the XenStore during the initial boot of the instance, if the instance is rebooted, the dom id changes and forces a reload of the XenStore and the initial configuration messages are cleared.  \n\nNeed a fix that can detect the reboot and push the messages back into the XenStore until they are consumed by the agent which loads after the Sysprep process has completed on the second boot.  This either resides inside compute or as something running in the hypervisor itself.",
