This is all well and good for Python itself, but most Unix subprocesses don't expect to work this way. Thus, when you are creating subprocesses from Python, it is very important to set SIGPIPE back to the default action. Before I realised this was necessary, I wrote code that caused serious data loss due to a child process carrying on out of control after its parent process died!\n\nOur execution stuff should make use of that.",
