After the state management changes in Folsom, periodic tasks in Compute\nmanage this scenario by setting the instance state to Error.\n\nMoreover, after the Scheduler comes back up, it consumes the message from the queue, the instances gets\nspawned and changes state to Active, hence this does not occur anymore.\n\nMarking invalid.\n",
