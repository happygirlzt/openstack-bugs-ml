This is not a good long-term solution and causes problems with linked_clone based images should an administrator delete the wrong file from cache.\n\n* be careful in the fix not to remove the wrong item from cache\n* be mindful of linked_clone based instances which will be partially linked to the file in cache (these instances will crash if a cache file is deleted).",

They got the error: \u201ccannot delete file <filename>\u201d\n\nSo I believe the customer already tried your workaround and says it does not work.  The bug is not looking to automatically delete the images, it just mentions that as the explanation for why the user is trying to delete those images.\n\n",
