This caused it to appear that the attach had failed.\n    \n    Additionally the idea of making extra API queries for a bash completion\n    cache should be thought through more.\n    \n    Conflicts:\n    \n    \tnovaclient/client.py\n    \tnovaclient/shell.py\n    \tnovaclient/v2/client.py\n    \tnovaclient/v3/client.py\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1423695\n    Change-Id: I6676a11f9b5318a1cda2d03a5d4550bda549d5c2\n",

Note: the failure actually happens *after*\n    the attach command is dispatched, so the volume attach will still\n    work, the user is presented an error though.\n    \n    Many TODOs remain for future patches. The test also tries to document\n    what was learned about the CLI redirection to cinder API, which was\n    introduced when Cinder was split out, but was tribal knowledge that\n    was lost in the mists of time.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1423695\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf474298be135843bff0114cf211bee19762f3ad\n",
