The\n    purpose of thise middleware is to set up the request URL correctly in\n    case there is a proxy (For instance, a loadbalancer such as HAProxy)\n    in front of Nova.\n    \n    So, for instance, when TLS connections are being terminated in the\n    proxy, and one tries to get the versions from the / resource of\n    Nova, one will notice that the protocol is incorrect; It will show\n    'http' instead of 'https'. So this middleware handles such cases.\n    Thus helping Keystone discovery work correctly.\n    \n    The HTTPProxyToWSGI is off by default and needs to be enabled via a\n    configuration value.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia78f73e96585ab33a379a0b0be6d9682f7fbd810\n    Closes-Bug: #1573766\n",

So for this to work, the middleware needs to be\n    added to the application pipelines.
