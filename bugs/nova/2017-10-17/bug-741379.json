The network-manage create seems to conflate the two concepts, such that I can't get this to work (either nova starts handing out IPs from 10.0.x.x or I get a /16 netmask) \n\n(Ryan Lane on IRC suggested I have to edit the DB, which might work for me, but won't fly for Cactus...)",

We need to add support for your use case. So this is not a bug, but a missing feature (wishlist).\r\n\r\nI see that it's a bit of a grey area though, since it all depends on expected behavior (and how common your use case is). So let's consider it a bug !",

I haven't really seen any\nnetworking documentation which just says \"do it this way and you'll be\nhappy\"\n\ne.g. If we're handing out IPs from complete networks, where are the hosts\nsupposed to live?  I can see why they probably should be in a separate\nsubnet (at least, particularly for public cloud), but then what's the\nrecommended router configuration?\n",
