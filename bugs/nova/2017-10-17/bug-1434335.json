This is a more restrictive check than the other APIs use. For example, the V2 flavor API and the V2.1 server group API allows any printable character and horizontal whitespace. \n\nThis can be confusing to the user who just created a server or a flavor with a non alpha-numeric character, but can't do so with a server group.\n\nI had originally opened up bug 1431932 to address this by making the error message more verbose to let the user know which characters are acceptable for a server group name.\n\nAfter going through a round of reviews, it appears that a better solution would be to make the behavior of the server group name validation the same as the name validation in all the other APIs. It looks like server groups was missed as part of the following commit https://review.openstack.org/#/c/119741/. The purpose of this commit was to make the flavor API and others less restrictive in the characters that are accepted for a name.",

Right now it will not allow\n    any non alphanumeric characters. Change this to allow all printable\n    and horizontal whitespace unicode characters.
