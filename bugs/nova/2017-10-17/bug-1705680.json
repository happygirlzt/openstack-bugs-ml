Send sighup signal \"kill -1 $parent_id_of_compute_service\" or \"kill -HUP $parent_id_of_compute_service\"\n\nWhereas if you send sighup signal to nova-api or nova-conductor then it reloads the configuration files.",

Most of the effort was tracked by https://docs.openstack.org/newton/config-reference/mutable.html\n\nAt the moment, we only have a very few mutable config options: \n - [libvirt]/live_migration_completion_timeout\n - [libvirt]/live_migration_progress_timeout\n - debug (inherited from oslo.log)\n - log_config_append (inherited from oslo.log too)\n\n\nCould you please verify the above config options and check those can be changed without requiring a service restart ?\n\nI'm closing the bug now as I think the expected behaviour is correct but feel free to reopen the bug if you see those 4 options not being mutable.\n",
