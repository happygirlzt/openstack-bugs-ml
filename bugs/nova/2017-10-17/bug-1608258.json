It does this using debtcollector\n    decorators on the methods with those kwargs. This is fine\n    at runtime but doesn't work with mox since mox stubs the\n    methods off the Client class, but doesn't pick up and stub\n    any decorators on those methods. So when our unit tests\n    pass tenant_id kwargs they fail on the moxed_client.\n    \n    To make the tests work for both neutronclient>5 and <5 we\n    simply pass the project_id as an arg rather than kwarg\n    to the show_quota method.\n    \n    Change-Id: I86bbac3e24bef27396297dfc79eb24c61dbcb6ac\n    Closes-Bug: #1608258\n",
