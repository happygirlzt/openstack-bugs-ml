POST is therefor also appropriate for bulk operations like\n213 multiple update, or triggering some arbitrary other actions beyond\n214 resource creation (for example, rebooting a server).\n\n\n247 * GET method\n248\n249  * GET method should be used only for getting information of resources, and it\n250    should not change resources' state at all because :rfc:`7231` mentions **GET\n251    is the primary mechanism of information retrieval and the focus of almost\n252    all performance optimizations.**.\n",
