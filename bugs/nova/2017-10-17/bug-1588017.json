This is wrong and could mislead users about how they should use and interpret those values.\n\nThe nova-specs for network_data.json [1] specifies that:\n* the link id should be a \"Generic, generated ID\".\n* the link type should be \"vif\" if it's a virtual interface and \"phy\" for physical interface.\n\nThe values currently used come from internal implementation details and shouldn't be passed on to the end-user. The implementation should be updated to respect the spirit of the spec. This will reduce confusion to initialization agent developers.\n\n[1] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/liberty/implemented/metadata-service-network-info.html#rest-api-impact",
