    "description": "Live migration in Cinder environment fails due to the issues identified around check_for_export() below:\n\n1. Parameter inconsistency:\ncheck_for_export() method in nova.volume.manager accepts \"instance_id\" as a parameter, which is inconsistent with \"instance_uuid\" used in cinder.volume.manager's check_for_export() def. \n\nThe parameter should be updated in nova.volume.manager and the corresponding RPC calls to check_for_export() should be updated.\n\n2. RPC call to check_for_export() in Compute Manager should\n   be converted to a RestFul API. This will also ensure that volumes present on multiple volume nodes and attached to an instance are discovered during live migration and migrated successfully.",
