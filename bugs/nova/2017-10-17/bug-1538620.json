This is not backwards compatible to earlier API versions, so when Nova calls attach with versions prior to this change with both arguments it causes a failure.\n\nThis information is needed for the multiattach work, but we should revert that change and try to find a cleaner way to do this that will not break backwards compatibility.",

Since the Nova patch was reverted, it does seem unlikely that anyone (Nova or other) would pass both in, and I'm not sure what harm it would do if they did and both were accepted (Mitaka cinder only). I don't see an issue in manager.py:attach_volume()\n\nBut...For Nova to use this the Cinder code needs to be microversioned. So either back this patch out or fix with microversion logic. Here's the patch that adds logic for pre-Mitaka (Microversion 3.0 or before) to continue to throw an exception for both host and instance_uuid, and allows new microversion 3.1 to accept both:\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/300684/2\n\n",

            "content": "Scott, yes, my comment was not about needing to fix it with a microversion or how it fails with M-Nova and L-Cinder. It was as you said where it is unlikely anyone would be calling it (in Mitaka) with both arguments. And if they did, that they would expect a failure.\n\nSo my comment was - granted it is a behavior change in an existing API - but do we need to revert it to the old behavior since no one will call it expecting the old behavior.\n\nAs long as the v3 API has existed, it has allowed both to be passed in. Let's just keep it that way and Nova can expect that with the base v3. No need to bump up a microversion to remove and then readd a change.",
