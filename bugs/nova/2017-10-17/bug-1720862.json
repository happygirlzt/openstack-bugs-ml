    "description": "A few weeks back, I followed the Newton Install Guides, and had no major issues getting OpenStack to work (in its entirety).  When I commissioned up a 2nd Compute Node, none of the VMs would instantiate.  After quite a bit of debugging, I realized that libguestfs was the issue. \n\nAt first, I went looking for a way to disable libguestfs in the configuration files. But as it turned out, even if you disable it, it still seems to be used by OpenStack. Finally, I decided to remove it from the box entirely, after reading that if OpenStack does not see it installed, it won't attempt to use it. I did not need anything writing to the image, so this made sense. \n\nAs it turns out, if you uninstall it, it uninstalls OpenStack Compute because of the dependency between the two.  I went ahead and got the rpm, and installed OpenStack Nova Compute with the --nodeps flag to get around the libguestfs.\n\nI have not researched why libguestfs causes so many issues. For the time being, my strategy is to run without it and rely on CloudInit and other ways of configuring instances.",
