    "description": "heal_instance_info_cache is a periodic task which refreshes the network cache for instances on a host.  Currently it processes instances which are still in the building state, which is both unnecessary (the build itself will update the cache when it completes) and can lead to a race condition;  If the periodic task gets Null network information (likely as the instance is still being built) but then gets pre-empted by the build thread and updates the cache after the instance has finished build has finished then the cache is in effect cleared.\n\nSimply skipping instances in the building state avoids this situation.",
