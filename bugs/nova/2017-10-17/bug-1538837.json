Therefore we end up with 500 internal server\n    error when triggering targeted live migration to non-existing compute\n    node. This patch adds ComputeHostNotFound to expected exception list\n    in both, conductor and API.\n    \n    Change-Id: If515a90217a8e329d932dcacb357b78081c505c1\n    Related-bug: 1538837\n",
