Currently (icehouse-3) nova would call cinder's \"reserve_volume\" (which will move the volume to the \"attaching\" state as described in the bug) in the API, and should be cleaning the state up on failure on the compute side of the \"attach_volume\" rpc call, from looking at the code. \n\nSo the likely culprit at this moment may be some issues with messages getting through. I will try to reproduce what is described above with the current trunk (it's been a year and a half since this has been reported), and circle back here once I have more info.",
