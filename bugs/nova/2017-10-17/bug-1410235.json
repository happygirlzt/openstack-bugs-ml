The problem is that Nova\n    base test case intentionally removes all attributes from a test case\n    class instance in its cleanup callback (to ensure there are no memory\n    leaks).\n    \n    Inheritance from Nova base test case was actually added when fixing\n    LP #1410235, so that TIMEOUT_SCALING_FACTOR attribute would be\n    handled properly (at that time it was done directly in Nova base test\n    case setUp(), and now it's a separate fixture).\n    \n    So in order for Nova unit tests to work correctly with new release of\n    oslo.db we need either to remove inheritance from Nova base test case\n    or to change the order of base classes to achieve the 'proper' MRO\n    for migration test cases. The latter can actually be problematic as\n    we also need to ensure TIMEOUT_SCALING_FACTOR is still handled\n    properly and not overridden by oslotest base test case.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1410235\n    \n    Change-Id: I5c7d2a391425766a5e8fd61a532b1a1e7d410770\n",
