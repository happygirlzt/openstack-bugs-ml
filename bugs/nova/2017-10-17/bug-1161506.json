I expect that dnsmasq is actually filtering out the '' because they aren't valid dns domain values, so it's working fine, though probably not on purpose from a dnsmasq perspective.\n\nI think the idea of fixing this more cleanly for havana to just drop that param to dnsmasq makes sense. would be a good clean up.",
