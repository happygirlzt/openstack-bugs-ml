However, if the attach method fails for some reason, the port is not cleaned up.\n\nThis behavior would be appropriate if the invoker had passed in a port identifier.  However if nova created the port for the action and that action failed, the port should be cleaned up as part of the failure.  \n\nThe allocation of the port occurs in nova/compute/manager.py in the attach_interface method.  Recommend that we de-allocate the port for the instance had no port_id been passed in.",
