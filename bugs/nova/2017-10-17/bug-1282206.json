I attempted to kill the green thread and then call wait so that the process launcher object can reap its child processes cleanly.  This resulted in a trace resulting from a GreenletExit exception being thrown.\n\nThe eventlet documentation states multiple times that GreenletExit is thrown after .kill() has been called to kill a thread.  I think ProcessLauncher should expect this and deal with it.",
