    "description": "If nova returns an empty object, novaclient generates a RuntimeError for any attempt to access the object.  This appears to be due to an attempt to access the 'id' attribute in the code path which refreshes the object from the server--if the id attribute is not present, then Resource.__getattr__() ends up being called recursively.  This is obviously a problem with nova, but novaclient should also be liberal in what it accepts and avoid triggering a recursion depth error.\n\nOne possible solution to this bug may be to simply pre-set the 'id' attribute to None, and raise an exception (404?) if id is None",
