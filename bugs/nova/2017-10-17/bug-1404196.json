    "description": "This bug reported a problem with the finish_migration method not passing image_meta to the libvirt blockinfo APIs\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1389850\n\nOn closer inspection there are a great many codepaths which don't pass image_meta to the libvirt blockinfo APIs. Essentially every single one of these is a bug which needs fixing, otherwise the user requested disk bus will not be honoured in those scenarios.\n\nThe best fix is to stop making the image_meta parameter be optional, with a None default. Make it compulsory and do not provide a default value. This way all callers are forced to pass it, which should reduce the scale of the problem",
