    "description": "During the spawn process the rollback portion of the create_vm_record step is supposed to detach volumes, destroy the VBDs, and then purge the SR.  But this process relies on looking up VBDs attached to the instance.  If the spawn process fails while creating/resizing a VDI then there's no VBD to lookup and the SR and VDI will be left on the hypervisor as orphans.",
