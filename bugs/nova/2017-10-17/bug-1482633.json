So neutron repogitory doesn't need to contain\n    these modules.\n    This patch makes neutron use tempest-lib's token_client and removes\n    the own modules for the maintenance.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ieff7eb003f6e8257d83368dbc80e332aa66a156c\n\ncommit 78aed58edbe6eb8a71339c7add491fe9de9a0546\nAuthor: Jakub Libosvar <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Aug 13 09:08:20 2015 +0000\n\n    Fix establishing UDP connection\n    \n    Previously, in establish_connection() for UDP protocol data were sent\n    but never read on peer socket.

It was querying for the inverse of RBAC entries that shared\n    to the querier, so it would return the network for each other tenant\n    it was shared to. This meant that if a network had multiple RBAC\n    entries, a shared=False filter wouldn't work in the API.\n    \n    This patch corrects the behavior by adjusting the query that looks\n    for objects not shared to the caller to make sure the object ID doesn't\n    appear in the shared subquery.\n    \n    This patch also adds a test that reliably reproduces the original issue.\n    The sporadically failing filter test that revealed this issue depended\n    on a race to have a network be shared to another tenant and to the wildcard\n    at the same time.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9dcd869c1640b223221ba12e97284bbfcabbeb2b\n    Closes-Bug: #1495040\n\ncommit 1886964890e1ba9d13df43d0caeff1546f2090a9\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Sep 4 23:06:43 2015 +0000\n\n    Updated from global requirements\n    \n    Change-Id: I6f3dbf989cb6d9d110c2ee6a3a2e2b557bced28f\n\ncommit ed3c317ed9182538747f74713154ad94e9d866db\nAuthor: Ihar Hrachyshka <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Sep 4 22:21:41 2015 +0200\n\n    Fixed functional test that validates graceful ovs agent restart\n    \n    The async_ping function returns a callable that returns True when all ping\n    futures are done.

For example,\n    starting a client connection to an SDN controller before forking\n    copies the fd of the socket to the child process, but then you have\n    multiple processes trying to read/write the same socket connection.\n    \n    It is also useful for a plugin to be able to do something in only\n    one process, regardless of how many workers are forked. One example\n    would be handling syncing from an external system to the neutron\n    database.\n    \n    This patch does 3 things:\n    1) Treats rpc_workers=0 as = 1. This simplifies the code for\n       handling notification that forking has completed. In the\n       existing code, calling the notification in the Worker object's\n       start() method would happen twice in the case where both api\n       and rpc workers were 0, despite there being only one process.\n       An earlier patch already changed the default api_workers to be\n       the number of processors.\n    2) Adds notification of forking via the callbacks mechanism.\n       Plugins can subscribe to resources.PROCESS, event.AFTER_CREATE\n       and do any post-fork initialization that needs to be done for\n       every spawned process.\n    3) Adds core/service plugin calls to get_workers() which defaults\n       to returning (). Plugins that need additional processes to spawn\n       should just return an iterable of NeutronWorkers that will be\n       spawned in their own process.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1463129\n    Change-Id: Ib99954678c2b4f32f486b537979d446aafbea07b\n\ncommit bd734811753a99d61e30998c734e465a8d507b8f\nAuthor: Nick <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Jul 19 22:41:27 2015 +0800\n\n    Implement external physical bridge mapping in linuxbridge\n    \n    In some deployment scenario, it is not allowed to remove system\n    ethernet configuration from physical interface to newly-created\n    physical bridge by neutron due to some IT regulations.\n    End-users require to take advantage of the pre-existed(user-defined)\n    physical bridge to connect tap devices for neutron.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1105488\n    Implements: blueprint phy-net-bridge-mapping\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia0eaa6233d8da93da32e86404b15184b77937d0a\n\ncommit a55e10cfd6369533f0cc22edd6611c9549b8f1b4\nAuthor: Oleg Bondarev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Aug 12 20:02:01 2015 +0300\n\n    Avoid DB errors when deleting network's ports and subnets\n    \n    DB errors may occur when accessing query results\n    after the transaction was closed (like ObjectDeletedError).\n    Hence it's better to avoid DB object access especially\n    when it's not needed.\n    This patch changes _delete_ports() and _delete_subnets() to accept\n    only ids.

Generally this\n    needs to be a unique Neutron-allocated IP address, because the\n    subnet's underlying L2 domain is bridged across multiple compute hosts\n    and network nodes, and for HA there may be multiple DHCP agents\n    running on that same bridged L2 domain.\n    \n    However, if the DHCP ports - on multiple compute/network nodes but for\n    the same network - are _not_ bridged to each other, they do not need\n    each to have a unique IP address.  Instead they can all share the same\n    address from the relevant subnet.  This works, without creating any\n    ambiguity, because those ports are not all present on the same L2\n    domain, and because no data within the network is ever sent to that\n    address.  (DHCP requests are broadcast, and it is the network's job to\n    ensure that such a broadcast will reach at least one of the available\n    DHCP servers.  DHCP responses will be sent _from_ the DHCP port\n    address.)\n    \n    Specifically, for some networking backends it makes sense to allow all\n    DHCP ports to use the subnet's gateway IP address, and thereby to\n    completely avoid any unique IP address allocation.\n    \n    This change therefore enhances the DHCP agent code to be able to use\n    gateway IPs as an alternative to uniquely allocated ones, with the\n    choice between those being made by a new interface driver property,\n    'use_gateway_ips'.  The back-compatible default is to use unique IPs.\n    An interface driver that wants the DHCP agent to use gateway IPs can\n    achieve that by overriding as follows:\n    \n        @property\n        def use_gateway_ips(self):\n            return True\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1486649\n    Change-Id: I17e1dc9231a5ec35bd6f84c4c7aca6350d76e8ec\n\ncommit 3de01b39b74d0a23f765b1f9b1a4ba1eb457068c\nAuthor: Stephen Ma <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Aug 27 04:50:14 2015 +0000\n\n    Resolve issue where router can't be removed from L3-agent in dvr mode\n    \n    Fixes the problem where the L3 DVR Scheduler is unable\n    to remove a DVR router from a L3 agent running in\n    'dvr' mode.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1489091\n    Change-Id: Id128a81d2cf7108936715ee305012fbff23ffdbf\n\ncommit c5d182da588d8dcf107d22735eb37250362043c0\nAuthor: rossella <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jul 23 19:41:20 2015 +0200\n\n    OVS agent add functional tests of OVS status\n    \n    Add a functional tests to verify that the agent\n    behaves correctly when OVS restarted.\n    \n    Partially-Implements: blueprint restructure-l2-agent\n    Change-Id: Ifeb0f2f6a06baead93df2c016ea26bfea990734d\n\ncommit 71dd3a0f87eb69072696f6905f8380924dd67c1a\nAuthor: rossella <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 31 17:25:37 2015 +0000\n\n    check_changed_vlans doesn't need registered_ports as param\n    \n    check_changed_vlans doesn't need registered_ports since the\n    ports processed by the agent are accessible from local_vlan_map\n    \n    Partially-Implements: blueprint restructure-l2-agent\n    Change-Id: I279dcaff469337c553b358f6f5476c7238e89a59\n\ncommit 4ea6810d50c0d960c4640f0c12c6ec025449b64d\nAuthor: YAMAMOTO Takashi <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Sep 1 16:26:03 2015 +0900\n\n    test_migrations: Remove unnecessary midonetclient mocks\n    \n    These seem leftovers from plugin decomposition.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib05ebbbd6627a1b69c413761b0e5a8e53817d8f2\n\ncommit ed392dc5354131b377ebf6aea518fb8e2ca7f893\nAuthor: Sergey Belous <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Aug 31 17:44:19 2015 +0300\n\n    Fixed filters for functional tests\n    \n    Removed filter for unused tee utility.\n    CommandFilter for curl replaced with more stricted RegExpFilter\n    and now allow run curl only with specified parameters.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5d151a63f85cb969f79d4d92f5422e8e88855be5\n    Closes-Bug: #1487139\n\ncommit 599977e20bd480305434168400055fa417aad8b1\nAuthor: Lajos Katona <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 7 15:04:35 2015 +0200\n\n    Fix locale problem in execute()\n    \n    Change from new format string to old style formatting.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib39de7169416c2cc053d4aa909075c68cd2d7f0b\n    Closes-bug: #1449897\n\ncommit e77eac8611f8fbb333168dc344c0056acaebb8b5\nAuthor: Edgar Magana <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sat Aug 29 08:00:17 2015 -0700\n\n    Improve python code for missing suggestion\n    \n    Include a missing suggestion in code already merged\n    \n    Related-Blueprint: better-quotas\n    \n    Change-Id: I5983ccf6e2f98d2df41403b3be06748d5556c181\n\ncommit 34a329b4de7c801c15b3c214cc2b122ac82d0b72\nAuthor: Swaminathan Vasudevan <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Aug 25 16:24:05 2015 -0700\n\n    Add a functional test to validate dvr snat namespace\n    \n    Add a functional test to validate the dvr snat\n    namespace and its internal interfaces when internal\n    networks are removed and added.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id44f5e5899e959be53b09e6f9bc732f553ae9a5a\n    Related-Bug: #1479130\n\ncommit 3a9e778399af8380b11c968da39e08b4a97a9f1f\nAuthor: Carl Baldwin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Aug 25 22:32:50 2015 +0000\n\n    Add snat ports cache to dvr router\n    \n    This reverses the effect of [1] but in a way that works with the\n    current structure of the code and keeps DVR details in DVR classes\n    \n    [1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/200293\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia8468881de6538882d4a14725b55db53e23d2e4c\n    Closes-Bug: #1479130\n\ncommit 72e388445eb6f6903ccfc5079aa206ac2cbcfd5e\nAuthor: Sachi King <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Dec 8 17:42:48 2014 +1100\n\n    Return exception when attempting to add duplicate VIP\n    \n    Neutron should never attempt to add a VIP to keepalived's config\n    multiple times, and to do so is an error.
