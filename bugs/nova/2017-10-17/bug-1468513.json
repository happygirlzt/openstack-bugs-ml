This change adds a\n    hacking check to assert this is being done during pep8.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id52c30bb5ded2184d772e6026b0f04f9a0efeb55\n    Related-Bug: #1404268\n    Closes-Bug: #1468513\n",

Since eventlet.spawn() calls\n    greenthread.spawn() under the covers, it should also be checked. Because\n    there are still occurrences of eventlet.spawn(), these were also cleaned\n    up in order to pass the added hacking check.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Qin Zhao <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia125b4ad5e84bf48091af5a7a483b89629f0ec31\n    Related-Bug: #1404268\n    Closes-Bug: #1468513\n",
