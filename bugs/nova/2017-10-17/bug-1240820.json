This patch changes\n    cleanup to a public method to driver, split instance destroy to two\n    step:\n    \n    1. destroy instance in the Hypervisor\n    2. cleanup instance resources(block device, network)\n    \n    Change-Id: I65e711c03fee7342b1e2bc4f9459baae7729f911\n    Closes-bug: 1240820\n",
