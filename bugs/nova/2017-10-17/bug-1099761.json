    "description": "In a running guest, if the guest admin does 'shutdown -h now', the VM will completely shutdown. It will take Nova up to 10 minutes to notice this and update its state, during which time it continues to report the VM as running. The only way to deal with this is to also run 'nova delete' on the host.\n\nThe core problem is that the nova.compute.manager._sync_states() method which is used to reconcille state. This is set as a periodic task, but is only set to run once every 10 minutes. We need to react to terminating instances much faster than this.",

Libvirt has an event notification mechanism which can efficiently get this data. We just need to figure out how to feed it back to the manager",
