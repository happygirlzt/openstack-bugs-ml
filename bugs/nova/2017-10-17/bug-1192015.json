    "description": "Cells wraps messages in routing so it will need to have some special code for serializing and deserializing objects.  For compute_api calls, it's currently only passing the instance_uuid in the message, also... and we should pass the full instance object.  This will allow us to simply call instance.refresh() before calling the compute_api in a child cell.  etc.",
