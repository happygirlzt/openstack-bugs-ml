    "description": "When retrieving images through the EC2 API, the image id looks like \"ami-00000001\"; when using the OS API it looks like \"1\".  Sadly the EC2 API only accepts the \"ami-00000001\" format, which means that if you query the OS API to get the image (which you have to do to get the metadata) you then can't use that image API to create an instance (which you have to do to specify an SSH key).  While I can perform the same mapping that the EC2 API no doubt does under the covers, I really shouldn't have to - I suggest that the EC2 API should be returned in the metadata, or the EC2 API create call should accept an OS Image Id.",

I don't think this is a bug, as we need to be able to move OSAPI forward without worrying about EC2. EC2 is a compatibility layer (defined completely out of our control) intended for users transitioning over to OSAPI (once that stabilizes).\n",
