This was merged as part of\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/29915\n    \n    The issue was that the code worked for the first IO usage event (the\n    one I looked at). Then when constructing the event payload for the second\n    and following IO usage events the code path ended up comparing a datetime\n    object from the db with a cached string representation of the last_refreshed\n    date that was passed into the conductor via the RPC.\n    \n    Since last_refreshed argument to vol_usage_update in the db layer is\n    not needed and is causing these issues. I have removed last_refreshed\n    argument from the db layer and deprecated it from the conduction API.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2030eb7912c56134ea688a6e8bbfcdeddca28307\n",
