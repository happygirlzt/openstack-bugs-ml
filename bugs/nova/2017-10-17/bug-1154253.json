The OVA gzip specification does not appear to apply here since the archive file is first extracted anyway and the resulting vhd files are imported uncompressed.  Given that, why limit the compression type to gzip only?  Changing \"tar xz\" to \"tar x\" doesn't remove any functionality for gzip archives and would allow hypervisors to extract any archive that tar is capable of regardless of compression type.",
