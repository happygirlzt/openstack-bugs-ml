However, our unit tests should not be testing libvirt;\n    the unit tests in libvirt already do that. Our unit tests should simply\n    test the code boundaries of the unit of code that they wish to stress,\n    and not anything further.\n    \n    This patch changes the unit test in question to only test the code\n    within the libvirt_driver.LibvirtDriver.get_info() method, and nothing\n    more, and in doing so, we remove any calls at all to libvirt and mock\n    out where the code passes the boundaries of the get_info() method.\n    \n    Change-Id: I022cc331a980c2a4d98f16d2d77b24839b528464\n    Closes-bug: #1301602\n",
