    "description": "If you configure nova to run on Calxeda ARM with libvirt/KVM, the generated libvirt configuration passes console as:\n\n<os>\n    \u2026\n    <cmdline>root=/dev/vda console=tty0 console=ttyS0</cmdline>\n</os>\n\nFor ARM guests the libvirt configuration should use 'console=ttyAMA0', hence as it stands you lose serial output for the guest. Currently the console settings are hard coded in nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py . I think we should modify that to be operator configurable via an option in nova.conf. I can submit a change accordingly, but would like feedback on if this sounds reasonable.",
