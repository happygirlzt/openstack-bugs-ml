    "description": "\nBecause the placement api (up to at least version 1.5) uses webob exceptions and response objects without much modification, when an error response is created it will have a content-type based on any guidance provided in an accept header. If no accept header is present then a textual default (either HTML or text/plain, can't remember right now and it is not relevant) is used.\n\nFor a web app that is served through the browser this is a reasonable default, but since the placement api is primarily a JSON-based thing, it would be better to have application/json as the default error format (while still allowing the accept header to be respected).\n\nNow that we are using the wsgi_wrapper.PlacementWsgify decorator on all our handlers, there is now an easy place to make this happen by checking the req for an accept header and if it is not there setting it to application/json for the error response.\n\nCare will need to taken to make sure that any error message that wants to use the value of accept isn't compromised.",
