There are many code paths that end up\n    in get_noftifier, so let's just handle it there just like we\n    default to CONF.host. Also the self.notifier in the\n    resource_tracker was not being used, so get rid of it.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1416435\n    Change-Id: I8838b961e49496cc85913a04bd99f9845ff308c3\n",
