But it raises exception ONLY if we have no instances\n    at all. It happens because filter with UUID in sqlalchemy query was missed\n    \n    Added missed filter\n    \n    This method is used only in instance tags CRUD operations.\n    To check that InstanceNotFound exception will be raised if we try\n    to create/delete/update tag of non existent instance we just didn't create\n    instance at all. So instance tags tests were \"green\" because exception\n    is raised ONLY if we have no instances at all.\n    \n    So to check that this bug is fixed we can just create some instances\n    in test_instance_tag_***_non_existing_instance tests.\n    Also method sqlalchemy.api._check_instance_exists is\n    private so we can't check it directly.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1425485\n    \n    Change-Id: I45834d04cd6ddd9e859f91a163f6b0f616106bb9\n",
