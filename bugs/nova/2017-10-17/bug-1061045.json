This should return something other than 500.\n\nEventually the compute server will timeout as well and leave the instance in ERROR. The instance is still running fine and ERROR seems like an incorrect state to leave the instance in.",

There are 10 retries combined with a 30 second timeout for the xenapi driver, this could take 300 seconds total. This is longer than the RPC timeout.\n\nThe retry logic seems unnecessary and appears to be a result of legacy code.\n\nIf the whole timeout was something reasonable, then an error could be returned synchronously to the client instead of requiring the instance to be moved to ERROR so an asynchronous error could be made available.",

This causes 500 errors in the OpenStack API.\n    * Implemented a 501 error in API if the password set fails.\n    * Modified xenapi agent to use NotImplementedError instead of Exception in\n      set_admin_password.\n    * Updated test code around set_admin_password to accept different exceptions.\n    * Fixes bug 1061045\n    \n    Change-Id: If7fab56c20f12e0490f4774e00004ed1d94242b9\n",
