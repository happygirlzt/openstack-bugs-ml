But that function should\n    be used by only for migration case. This patch use the new network api\n    'setup_instance_network_on_host' to update network for instance.\n    \n    Also for nova-network, floating-ip should cleanup when unshelve offload\n    instance. This patch invoke cleanup_instance_network_on_host when unshelve\n    offload instance.\n    \n    Change-Id: I75df695ec7b14ebaa25f384ba9a0697a179af03a\n    Closes-Bug: #1350704\n",
