This is because\n    outgoing traffic is no longer snatted to the floating ip.\n    \n    This patch fixes it by adding an ebtables rule to force traffic\n    from ips that have a floating ip associated to route instead\n    of bridge.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1096985\n    \n    Change-Id: I8e4904660d42fe51c44b66686bed9f5d622693bd\n",
