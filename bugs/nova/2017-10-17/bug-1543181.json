This command line is copied from the code which actually fallocates a disk. However, while this works on systems with an older version of util-linux, such as RHEL 7, it does not work on systems with a newer version of util-linux, such as Fedora 23.

This is because the\n    -n option directs it to retain the file's existing size. A\n    non-existent file does not have an existing size. fallocate in older\n    releases of util-linux creates a zero-sized file in this case. This\n    results in _can_fallocate() always returning false, and therefore\n    never preallocating.\n    \n    While this may reasonably be argued to be a regression in util-linux,\n    the -n option doesn't make sense here anyway, so we remove it.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1543181\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie96fa71e7d2641d30572b8eda5609dd3ca5b6708\n",
