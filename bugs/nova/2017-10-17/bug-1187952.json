The reason was that the\n    error message was passed in as an `explanation`\n    keyword which isn't understood by `NovaException`,\n    and so is thrown away.\n    \n    This is part of a patch set to improve keypair\n    error message reporting in both the Openstack and\n    EC2 APIs.\n    \n    References bug 1187952\n    Change-Id: Ide319cb126955927d623972dffd573cd4c4314df\n",
