Incorrect versions of some files were incorporated into packages for different linux distros ?\nBy bug I meant that slightly different versions are not interoperable.\n\nIt seems to have been corrected\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1405741\n\nThe thing is - my controller was on 2014.2 -> compute was on 2014.2-1-1 (was not working, issue described in all links above)\nUpgrade to 2014.2-2 solved the problem.\n\nAfterwards I installed another compute node and it was on 2014.2.2.dev11 (OpenSUSE that time) and it was not working with controller on 2014.2 (same symptoms as above), so finally I have upgraded controller to run 2014.2.1, now it seems to be working fine with all compute nodes.\n",
