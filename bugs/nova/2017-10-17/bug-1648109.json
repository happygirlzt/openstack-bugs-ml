This is\n    confounded by Image.cache(), which doesn't call the given callback\n    (_create_ephemeral in this case), if the target already exists.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1648109\n    Co-authored-by: Feodor Tersin <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: Ic9178d6c013670611e63d54a7669f35dc9770e91\n",
