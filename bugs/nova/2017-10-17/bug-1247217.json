    "description": "The fix for bug 1231263 ( https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1231263 ) addressed not logging the clear-text password in the nova wsgi.py module for the adminPass attribute for the Server Change Password REST API, but this only addressed that specific attribute.  Since Nova has support for the ability to add REST API Extensions (in the contrib directory), there could any number of other password-related attributes in the request/response body for those additional extensions.\n\nAlthough it would not be possible to know all of the various sensitive attributes that these API's would pass in the request/response (the only way to totally eliminate the exposure would be to not log the request/response which is useful for debugging), I would like to propose a change similar to the one that was made in keystone (under https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1166697) to mask the password in the log statement for any attribute that contains the \"password\" sub-string in it.\n\nThe change would in essence be to update the _SANITIZE_KEYS / _SANITIZE_PATTERNS lists in the nova/api/openstack/wsgi.py module to include a pattern for the \"password\" sub-string.\n\nAlso, for a slight performance benefit, it may be useful to put a check in to see if debug logging level is enabled around the debug statement that does the sanitize call (since the request/response bodies could be fairly large and wouldn't want to take the hit to do the pattern matches if debug isn't on).",
