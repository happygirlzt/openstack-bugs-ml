It prevents to create consistent instance data, because root_device_name instance attribute has /dev/ prefix, but device_name bdm attribute doesn't.\n\nEnvironment: DevStack\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1 Create bootable volume\n$ cinder create --image-id xxx 1\nNote: I used cirros-0.3.2-x86_64-uec ami image.\n\n2 Boot instance from the volume by legacy bdm.\n$ nova boot --flavor m1.nano --block-device-mapping /dev/vda=yyy:::1 inst\n\n3 Wait instance status Active, go to instance console and look to 'No bootable device' message.\n\n\nThe reason is in _get_bdm_image_metadata in nova/compute/api.py.
