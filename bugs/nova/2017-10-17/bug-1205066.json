This change raises\n    NotImplementedError rather than passes so that tempest will fail out\n    quickly when testing something that the powervm driver does not\n    implement.\n    \n    Also removes the overridden manage_image_cache method since it didn't do\n    anything, which is exactly what the base class does.\n    \n    Added unit tests to make sure that methods which should simply pass do\n    and that tests which should raise NotImplementedError do that also.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1205066\n    \n    Change-Id: Ieaf256a5c0f54804686318d6cbd5877a5003c9eb\n",
