This happens even if the compute node record _is_ deleted, because of our join of the services table, which causes us to get back rows anyway. This results in the stats showing more resource than actually exists, and disagreeing with the sum of all the individual hypervisor-show operations.\n\nThis is the query we're doing:\n\nMariaDB [nova]> SELECT SUM(memory_mb) FROM compute_nodes JOIN services ON compute_nodes.host=services.host WHERE services.binary=\"nova-compute\" AND compute_nodes.deleted=0;\n+----------------+\n| SUM(memory_mb) |\n+----------------+\n|        1047917 |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n \nAnd this is what we *should* be doing\n\nMariaDB [nova]> SELECT SUM(memory_mb) FROM compute_nodes JOIN services ON compute_nodes.host=services.host WHERE services.binary=\"nova-compute\" AND compute_nodes.deleted=0 AND services.deleted=0;\n+----------------+\n| SUM(memory_mb) |\n+----------------+\n|         655097 |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe second value is correct for the database in question.",
