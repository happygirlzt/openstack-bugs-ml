These\nquotas are never decremented leading to invalid quota limits being\nenforced.\n\nThis migration performs a full sync of quotas, and removes the incorrect\nrows for each resource type.\n\nI wonder why not just updating the existing resource entries with their user id but removing them and created new entries?",

After the upgrade from Grizzly to Havana is\n    completed, the migration script 203 adds a new column user_id, so\n    user_id is null for all data in quota_usages. So the correct\n    behaviour should be sync quota_usages table first and then delete\n    data if user_id is still null.\n    \n    Fixing the existing migrate script is because we can not find\n    the quota_usages data after migration script 216.\n    \n    Closes-bug:1245746\n    \n    Change-Id: I4db62884785a4eb6e1db2c5b114b9c6e1b4882ad\n",
