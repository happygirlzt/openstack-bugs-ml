This return statement would\n    short-circuit the for loop it's in such that no other build\n    requests in the loop would get processed (so those instances\n    wouldn't get built).\n    \n    This was probably missed because of how large the method is so\n    that when you're looking at that cleanup code, it's easy to miss\n    that you're in a for loop.\n    \n    This change moves the build request cleanup block into a private\n    method so it's more self-contained, and fixes the issue with the\n    return statement by changing it to a 'continue' statement.\n    \n    An existing test that deals with multiple instances already is\n    updated to show the bug and the fix (and also cleaned up a bit\n    in the process to avoid lots of copy/paste).\n    \n    Change-Id: I399023ea705c514c33d07cc3613d79744cbf7a07\n    Closes-Bug: #1661024\n",
