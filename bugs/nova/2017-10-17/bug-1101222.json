    "description": "Say you have two compute nodes, compute1 and compute 2\n\nvncserver_proxyclient_address on compute1 is set to the public address of compute1 - i.e. the address by which the proxy should connect to the VNC server on compute1\n\nIf an admin gets this wrong - e.g. copies nova.conf to compute2 and forgets to change the config option - it has pretty disastrous security implications. Without any warning or sign that there's a problem, users attempting to connect to the VNC console of their VM will be sent to the VNC console of some other VM which happens to be running on the same port on a different compute node.\n\nI've seen and debugged this in a real deployment :)",
