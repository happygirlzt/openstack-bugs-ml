There are a\n    couple of acceptable ways to deal with this:\n    \n    1) Leave most of the code and only remove the client side.  This means\n       that a message sent from an earlier version will still work.  This is\n       the ideal situation for almost *all* changes to rpc APIs.  We have to\n       make a habit of this to eventually be able to support rolling\n       upgrades.\n    \n    2) Leave the manager methods, but simply have them raise an exception.\n       This is a bit better than removing the method because the error\n       can be made more explicit and obvious.  Otherwise, the operator will\n       get \"no such method\" rpc exceptions, which will seem a bit more\n       bizzare.\n    \n       An example of when this option makes sense is commit\n       cac332c39645286a11c009094a86f62d02752183.  This patch refactored the\n       live migration code is such a significant way that making it\n       backwards compatibile seemed rather difficult to do.  The old rpc\n       methods stuck around but just raise an exception.  The potential\n       failure is just that live migration would fail, but the exception\n       makes it obvious that an upgrade must be completed for live migration\n       to work.\n    \n    The current patch implements #2 in the case of get_service_capabilities,\n    since it hasn't been used since pre-essex.  Approach #2 is taken for\n    get_host_list() as well.  It was used until fairly recently, but was\n    broken, including being broken in Essex.  The fix that went into Essex\n    for this makes it no longer use RPC.\n    \n    Fix bug 1029262.\n    \n    Change-Id: I74c7d2a3e88b3a4f114e7da62c56f0481ee64a64\n",
