The 0.17 release was in Feb,\n    2015. The evzookeeper library hasn't been updated since Sep 2012 and the\n    sole maintainer is the original author of the zookeeper servicegroup\n    driver.\n    \n    The tooz driver spec - Ibf70c2dbe308fc8e4dd277d8c75c4445b3dfce90 -\n    proposes a formal deprecation period for the zk driver, during which\n    existing zk driver users are encouraged to move to tooz. However, given\n    the state of the zk driver, we must conclude that there are no existing\n    users who need a graceful migration path. Removing the driver will\n    avoid potential confusion for new users and simplify the path to\n    adopting tooz.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1443910\n    Closes-Bug: #1414517\n    Closes-Bug: #1414536\n    \n    Signed-off-by: Mark McLoughlin <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I2dba71e71b1ed7cf8476e8bfe9481e84be5df128\n",
