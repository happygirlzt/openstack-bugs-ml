That assumption leads to\n    some unsavory parsing and crashing if the line doesn't match\n    the expected format.\n    \n    This patch checks to make sure that the word \"import\" is in the line\n    as well as starting with \"from\", which at least gets us a bit closer\n    to a reasonable assumption.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1071849\n    \n    Change-Id: Iab666fcd04a9aaa3a490737a173ee3189b9b8329\n",
