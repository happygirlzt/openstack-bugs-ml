(Replication factor is a number  which tells how much times information into the Ceph storage would be duplicated).\nFor example we have 3 nodes and each node has 60 Gb storage.\nReplication factor is 2. So total storage is 60 * 3 / 2 = 90.\nBut now size of a total storage is calculating as 60 + 60 + 60 = 180.  See the screenshot (the real size of storage is 207 Tb.)\nSo if type storage is Ceph, we should ask information about size of storage directly from Ceph.",
