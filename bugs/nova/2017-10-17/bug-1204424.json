Creation of ephemeral block devices would fail,\n       due to permission issues, during an attempt to format it without sudo,\n       in _create_local.\n    2. The device/image would be formatted twice, while the final\n       filesystem will differ from the one provided in\n       CONF.default_ephemeral_format.\n    \n    This patch will format only once, relying on the changed\n    disk.mkfs command, that takes CONF.default_ephemeral_format\n    into consideration.\n    It will also run the command as root only for block devices,\n    according to the disk_image is_block_dev property.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1204424\n    Change-Id: I2bf7abc982e20eaaf7bca7cd798b4134b76d10a8\n",

In particular in _create_ephemeral() this is not called for block devices (and nova fails):\n\nself._create_local(target, ephemeral_size) \n\nSo, as far as I understand, when RBD is set as a Nova backend, then ephemeral disk is created on a filesystem, then it is formatted with mkfs and only then then imported to Ceph (effectiveness of such algorithm is a separate issue). So, I see in IceHouse that if I replace\n\nif not is_block_dev:\n     self._create_local(target, ephemeral_size)\n\nto just \n\nself._create_local(target, ephemeral_size)\n\nthen Nova does not fail.\n",
