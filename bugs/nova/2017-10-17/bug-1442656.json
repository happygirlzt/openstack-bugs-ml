This could happen if\n    an instance hasn't been touched for several releases, or if the data\n    set is old.\n    \n    The fix is a simple change to use outerjoin instead of join. This patch\n    includes a test that ensures that instances with no instance_extra rows\n    are included in the migration.

Thus we avoid any locking, but also make sure that\n    the host_state is kept as up to date as possible for concurrent\n    requests, as there is no opportunity for switching threads inside a\n    consume_from_instance.\n    \n    Several things worth noting:\n      * Scheduler being lock free (and thus racy) does not really affect\n      resources other than PCI and NUMA topology this badly - this is due\n      to complexity of said resources. In order for scheduler decesions to not\n      be based on basically guessing, in case of those two we will likely need\n      to introduce either locking or special heuristics.\n    \n      * There is a lot of repeated code between the 'consume_from_instance'\n      method and the actual filters. This situation should really be fixed but\n      is out of scope for this bug fix (which is about preventing valid\n      requests failing because of races in the scheduler).\n    \n    Change-Id: If0c7ad20506c9dddf4dec1eb64c9d6dd4fb75633\n    Closes-bug: #1438238\n    (cherry picked from commit d6b3156a6c89ddff9b149452df34c4b32c50b6c3)\n\ncommit a4e9a146c3993f5775501716a21632f34a63a3ad\nAuthor: Rajesh Tailor <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 15 06:59:04 2015 -0700\n\n    Fix kwargs['migration'] KeyError in @errors_out_migration decorator\n    \n    @errors_out_migration decorator is used in the compute manager on\n    resize_instance and finish_resize methods of ComputeManager class.\n    It is decorated via @utils.expects_func_args('migration') to check\n    'migration' is a parameter to the decorator method, however, that\n    only ensures there is a migration argument, not that it's in args or\n    kwargs (either is fine for what expects_func_args checks).\n    The errors_out_migration decorator can get a KeyError when checking\n    kwargs['migration'] and fails to set the migration status to 'error'.\n    \n    This fixes the KeyError in the decorator by normalizing the args/kwargs\n    list into a single dict that we can pull the migration from.\n    \n    Change-Id: I774ac9b749b21085f4fbcafa4965a78d68eec9c7\n    Closes-Bug: 1444300\n    (cherry picked from commit 3add7923fc16c050d4cfaef98a87886c6b6a589c)\n\ncommit 389368bcfe498323b369f68682babb92a5b0ca54\nAuthor: Gary Kotton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 15 05:14:42 2015 -0700\n\n    Resource tracker: unable to restart nova compute\n    \n    The resource tracker calculates its used resources.

If the compute service is still up\n    while this happens it will try to call the stop API to power off the\n    instance and update the database to show the instance as stopped.\n    \n    When the compute service comes back up and events come in from the virt\n    driver that the guest VMs are running, nova will see that the vm_state\n    on the instance in the nova database is STOPPED and shut down the\n    instance by calling the stop API (basically ignoring what the virt\n    driver / hypervisor tells nova is the state of the guest VM).\n    \n    Alternatively, if the compute service shuts down after changing the\n    intance task_state to 'powering-off' but before the stop API cast is\n    complete, the instance can be in a strange vm_state/task_state\n    combination that requires the admin to manually reset the task_state to\n    recover the instance.\n    \n    Let's just try to avoid some of this mess by disconnecting the event\n    handling when the compute service is shutting down like we do for\n    neutron VIF plugging events.
