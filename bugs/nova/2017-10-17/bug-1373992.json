This change replaces use of httplib.HTTPSConnection\n    with the requests module. It imports config settings related to SSL\n    verification: ssl.key_file, ssl.cert_file, and ssl.ca_file. It also\n    adds one config setting: keystone_ec2_insecure. By default, SSL\n    verification is on, but can be disabled by setting:\n    \n    keystone_ec2_insecure=true\n    \n    This patch is based on the keystone middleware ec2 token patch:\n    \n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76476\n    \n    SecurityImpact\n    DocImpact\n    Closes-Bug: #1373992\n    \n    Change-Id: I8e46d41164e9478b820cad569ba82f25de244620\n",
