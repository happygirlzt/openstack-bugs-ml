All of them will get scheduled as a result, and only one will actually successfully attach the volume, while others will go to ERROR.\n\nThis is not ideal since we can reserve the volume in the API, thus making it a bit more user friendly when there is a race (the user will be informed immediately instead of seeing an errored instance).",
