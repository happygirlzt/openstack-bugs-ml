They are as follows:\n      1. get_volume_metadata\n      2. delete_volume_metadata\n      3. update_volume_metadata\n      4. get_volume_metadata_value\n    These methods are required in cases where nova needs to modify\n    a cinder volume's metadata, e.g. attach and detach time. It also\n    completes the cinder.API class.\n    \n    Change-Id: I360076ae28db43e661466f556425947813c9040e\n    Closes-Bug: #1296164\n",
