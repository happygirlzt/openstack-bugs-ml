    "description": "A VMware hypervisor can have various types of non-contiguous resource. This includes:\n\n* CPUs and memory, assuming a cluster has more than 1 member.\n* Storage space, if a (VMware) host has more than 1 datastore.\n\nFocussing on the latter, if a host has 5 datastores, each with 50GB of free space, we currently report the largest contiguous free space to the hypervisor: 50GB. This means that the scheduler knows it can allocate an instance with a 50GB block device, but until the host stats are updated it will not allow subsequent instances to be scheduled there. We could alternatively report 250GB of free space, but would risk the scheduler repeatedly sending us a request for an instance with a 100GB block device, which we cannot fulfil. Without the ability to represent non-contiguous resources we are left choosing between 2 suboptimal choices.",
