Make them say \"no thanks\" to the DB API\n    to reduce the amount of work that needs to be done. Note some\n    refactoring was done in the _get_instance_nw_info() method to pull\n    this information if it ended up being necessary. The cases where this\n    would happen are error-cleanup scenarios, and thus taking the extra\n    hit in that case is an overall win for not having to do it all the\n    time.\n    \n    Related to bug 1164737\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic7d6290c0b7edf84cbf8bdc64e29f206619f97e5\n",
