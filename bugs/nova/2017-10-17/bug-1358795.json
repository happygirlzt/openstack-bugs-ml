    "description": "If an instance is deleted at a point during the virt driver.spawn() method that doesn't raise an exception, or while the power state is being updated, then the instance.save() which sets the final power state, vm_state, task_state, and launched_at will raise InstanceNotFound or UnexpectedDeletingTaskStateError and cause the final create.end notification to be skipped.  This could have implications for billing/usage in a deployment.",

This adds a try/except\n    block around that call with appropriate handling of the exception.\n    \n    Change-Id: I308ee84f6ab2bb37ef6570ff896017615a5bf746\n    Closes-bug: #1358795\n",
