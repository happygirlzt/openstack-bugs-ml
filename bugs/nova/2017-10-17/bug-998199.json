            "content": "Sadly that is not the case :)\n\nSorry, I should have said this in my original bug report, but I believe the combination of these two lines is the problem:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L196\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L203\n\nBasically the \"maxcount\" is being used as the quota count and the current server count, but that is actually the number of servers requested.  So, for example, if it was a single api call that requested 4 servers, it would have said that I had used 4 out of 4 instances, assuming I was over quota.\n\nThe quota check itself is valid, its just the error message that is incorrect.",
