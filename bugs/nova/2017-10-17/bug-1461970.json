This means\n    that the delete operation cannot be performed while there is\n    another operation pending.\n    \n    This patch fixes this problem by requesting all the instance jobs\n    and killing them right before the delete operation.\n    \n    Closes Bug: #1461970\n    \n    Change-Id: I0e3fca20981e1080814224b8cee7cea5b8c6a53f\n",
