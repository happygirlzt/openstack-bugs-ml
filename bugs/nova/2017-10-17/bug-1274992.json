Review #56381 was attempting to check the presence of Neutron, in order to determine if hairpinning should be enabled on the bridge that Nova creates. Only after creating a new configuration flag in Nova.conf and checking the setting, were the unit tests passing and the race condition resolved.\n\nMy hunch is that the global variable that utils.is_neutron( ) creates is the root cause of the issue.\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/56381/",

Specifically, a\n    greenthread switch could occur when the import is being done.  At that point, it\n    looks like the check has already been completed, but the result has not yet been\n    recorded.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1274992\n    Change-Id: I5a6eedaeb4c0deee4b31509946ae5daedf98389d\n",
