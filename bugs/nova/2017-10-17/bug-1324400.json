In this case the instance will be launched properly.\nBut this bug will still remain. Because it's reason is in difference between instance root_device_name and device_name in bdm. We pass 'vda' to bdm, but virt driver sets '/dev/vda/' to root_device_name.\n\nAlso when using block-device parameter we get yet another bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1322157\n\nSo now the only way to boot properly worked instance is to use image and block-device-mapping parameters.\n\nAlso since this manner of booting is legacy, many end user scripts can use it. Moreover this manner was recommended in previous version of documentation: http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-ops/content/attach_block_storage.html\nFuthernore neigher nova cli, nor Nova API are not blocks this combination of parameters.\nSo the bug exists.\n\nAnother matter that this bug can be fixed differently.\nFor example, we can block this way of booting.\nOr we can fix virt driver to path device_name in a bdm too, or not to path root_device_name in an instnace.\n\nAll methods listed above have their own advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe method choosed by me has an advantages - it does not affect other parts of code.",

See commit message in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/112975/.\nBut in previous versions it was unable to work with volume backed instances through EC2 (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1323403).\n\nSo i'm not sure that this bug (and other related, but not just registered) should be fixed.",
