    "description": "Windows guests within a XenServer environment currently do not have the ability to properly have ConfigDrive attached unless the environment has its nova.conf set up as:\n\nconfig_drive_format=vfat\n\nThis issue ultimately results from this value being defaulted to ISO9660 (CDFS) and the VBD object being used for it being a disk (the nova.virt.xenapi.vm_utils.create_vbd default).  After testing, While the VBD is attached without issue and in the proper stateI was unable to get this drive to show up within Windows at all.  I was unable to see the drive detected within the GUI, or within Windows Powershell.  \n\nThis can be addressed by detecting the nova.conf configuration setting, and adjusting the VBD attach accordingly.  I will be submitting a follow-up commit shortly.",
