I had about 800 unallocated VCPUs over 43 nodes when I ran this so it's a significant fraction of my available capacity.  \n\nSwitching back to the FilterScheduler with the same command 230 instances got schedule on one node that only had 17 available.\n\nI've seen similar behaviour with numbers as low as 100.
