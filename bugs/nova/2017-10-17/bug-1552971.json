    "description": "[Impact]\n\n Backporting to Liberty Ubuntu Cloud Archive from Mitaka. The backport is\n fairly simple and clean with the exception of extra two unit tests that\n had to be ammended in order to work. The Liberty codebase still has the\n ec2 api code that is deprecated in Kilo and subsequently removed in Mitaka\n and there is a unit test for that api that was failing.\n\n[Test Case]\n\n * Deploy Openstack Liberty with this patch\n\n * Populate some security groups and create/delete some instances, checking\n   that the security groups are functioning properly.\n\n * Run full Tempest test suite (rev 13.0.0) against deployed cloud.\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\n This patch has not received any testing with the ec2 api in future releases\n due the fact that that api is removed in M. Tempest did not find any errors\n when testing against L though so I not envisaging any regressions.\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe nova.objects.instance.InstanceList class's get_by_security_group_id function calls the db.security_group_get function, which uses the _security_group_get_query() function to generate a query object. That query, by default, joins with the secgroup-rules table, and currently the db.security_group_get function offers no option to avoid joining with the rules. As a result:\n\nIf a group-source secgroup-rule exists on a security group with a large number of instances and a large number of rules, the db query result will be very large and take multiple seconds to complete, tying up conductor and making the system unresponsive.\n\nSince the InstanceList.get_by_security_group_id call only aims to build a list of instances, there is no need in this case to join with the rules, and so the db.security_group_get call should optionally avoid joining with the rules table.",
