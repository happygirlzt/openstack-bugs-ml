    "description": "There are a number of emulated timers presented to KVM virtual machines, the most important of which are the PIT and the RTC. Unfortunately the default KVM/QEMU policies for these timers is sub-optimal, raising potential for BSOD in Windows 7 guests and time drift in old Linux guests (those with kernels lacking KVM clock). To address this, Nova needs to set a couple of custom policies for KVM guests. The following XML can be used\n    \n      <clock offset='utc'>\n        <timer name='pit' tickpolicy='delay'/>\n        <timer name='rtc' tickpolicy='catchup'/>\n      </clock>\n    \nWhich corresponds the following KVM options\n    \n      -no-kvm-pit-reinjection\n      -rtc base=utc,driftfix=slew\n\nThe PIT and RTC settings are required for Linux guests, and the RTC setting is required for Windows guests. The PIT setting should not adversely affect Windows guest, so it is reasonable at this point to set both settings for all guests. In the future this ought to be configurable per guest OS type and disk images identified by OS type somehow.",

Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 11 17:16:10 2012 +0100\n\n    Update default policies for KVM guest PIT & RTC timers\n    \n    The default policies for the KVM guest PIT and RTC timers\n    are not very good at maintaining reliable time in guest\n    operating systems. In particular Windows 7 guests will\n    often crash with the default KVM timer policies, and old\n    Linux guests will have very bad time drift\n    \n    Set the PIT such that missed ticks are injected at the\n    normal rate, ie they are delayed\n    \n    Set the RTC such that missed ticks are injected at a\n    higher rate to \"catch up\"\n    \n    This corresponds to the following libvirt XML\n    \n      <clock offset='utc'>\n        <timer name='pit' tickpolicy='delay'/>\n        <timer name='rtc' tickpolicy='catchup'/>\n      </clock>\n    \n    And the following KVM options\n    \n      -no-kvm-pit-reinjection\n      -rtc base=utc,driftfix=slew\n    \n    This should provide a default configuration that works\n    acceptably for most OS types. In the future this will\n    likely need to be made configurable per-guest OS type.\n    \n    Fixes LP bug #1011848\n    \n    Change-Id: Iafb0e2192b5f3c05b6395ffdfa14f86a98ce3d1f\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.
