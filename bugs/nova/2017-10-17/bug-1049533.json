The\n    live_migrate task is accepted at API, and will change task_state to\n    MIGRATING. However the first task may continue to update task_state or\n    set it to None as it finishes.\n    \n    This patch avoids it by updating task_state in compute.api.live_migrate\n    level with expected_task_state=None.\n    \n    Add test case for compute.api.live_migrate.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1049533\n    \n    Change-Id: Ida8cef4797de421a7e356c9f5e882fe926535639\n",
