See: http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2012/01/using-vnc-client-to-connect-to-vms-in.html\n\n2) Code issue:\n\nIt seems like VNC consoles works with the ESXDriver, was not updated for the VCDriver, as get_vnc_console returns CONF.vmwareapi_host_ip, which is the ESX host IP with the ESXDriver, but is the vCenter host IP with the VCDriver (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py#L1105).",
