After adding some looooong network (172.16.0.0/19 in my case) and marking first C-class subnet (172.16.0.0/24) of this network inoperable (trough setting reserved=1 directly in database) for technical usage, nova trying to assign first IP of 2nd subnet (172.16.1.0/24) to the first created VM.\n\nIn result, we got VM with assigned IP 172.16.1.0, which can cause some strange things in networking and communication with world.\n\nBy default, nova-manage marks reserved only first and last IPs of full added network (by CIDR), but I think, it must mark first and last IPs of each C-class subnet too.",
