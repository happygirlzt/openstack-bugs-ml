    "description": "When a compute node is deleted (or marked deleted) in the DB and another compute node is re-added with the same name, things break.\n\nThis is because the resource tracker caches the compute node object/dict and uses the 'id' to update the record. When this happens, rt.update_available_resources will raise a ComputeHostNotFound. This ends up short-circuiting the full run of the update_available_resource() periodic task.\n\nThis mostly applies when using a virt driver where a nova-compute manages more than 1 \"hypervisor\".",
