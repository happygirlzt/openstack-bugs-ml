            "content": "The fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1194178 basically returns functionality back into Folsom that was accidentally removed from Grizzly. To work off of the beginning example:\n\nCompute node A = 192.168.1.10\nCompute node B = 192.168.1.11\n\nIn Folsom the DHCP iptables rules would be mapped to the host in which the instance is associated. Suppose you booted the instance on node A, then the rule would look like: \n\n-A instance -s 192.168.1.10/32 -p udp -m udp --sport 67 --dport 68 -j ACCEPT\n\nThis rule basically allows DHCP traffic from the nova-network on compute node A: 192.168.1.10. With the introduction of issue 1194178, the DHCP rule would ignore the instance's host and be the ip address of the nova-network that responded to that allocate_address message. In this case, there would be 50/50 chance of it being either 192.168.1.10 or 192.168.1.11. So the fix for 1194178 basically returns the functionality back.\n\nA fix for this issue would be to have the instance look like its had already migrated and on the destination host when acquiring its network_info. This will return back the correct ip address for the DHCP server (the destination host). In this example the instance is migrating from node A to node B. The method \"pre_live_migration\" is called on node B, which then makes a call to the network API to determine the instance's network info. This info is then used to setup the filtering rules for the instance. Before the call to the network API, the instance object's host field can be modified to be \"self.host\" (i.e. node B). This will be an in-memory only change and will cause the network API to repsond with the correct DHCP server.\n ",
