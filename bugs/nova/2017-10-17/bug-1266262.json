So the default now is ext4 for all linux with\n    this commit. Also note that for non-linux and non-windows\n    the default used to be ext3, now it is vfat.\n    \n    Note that there is still support for ext3 as the default if some\n    deployers do choose to keep that as the default, by using either\n    virt_mkfs or default_ephemeral_format configuration option. We\n    are just trying to move the default for everyone who is starting\n    fresh.\n    \n    Originally logged by lifeless as I833356af81df743a63d4442d389be82bc25f3914,\n    reverted in I8de225729bbc77b263fcac2fa72b0e9cc6c1b2bf by phil and re-proposed\n    by swapnil in Ibe9e9ba4265125c5bd933cde1a93cca02511bb46\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1266262\n    Change-Id: I92cb51c6118e48fd66ada0e2fee624597c4ad8f0\n",
