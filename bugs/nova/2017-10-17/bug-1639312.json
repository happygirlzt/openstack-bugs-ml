Right now we always can update\n      VNC/SPICE listen address.\n    * Destination node was running old-code that does not set the fields.\n      Currently when live migrating between two versions of OpenStack\n      (N and N-1) the fields are always set.\n    \n    Therefore this check is redundant and can be removed.\n    \n    Going deeper in this code - graphics_listen_addr_vnc and\n    graphics_listen_addr_spice in libvirt migrate data object are of\n    type IPAddressField. It means that both need to contain valid IP address.\n    By default in nova.conf it is 127.0.0.1. It can't be set to None because\n    IP address is taken from nova.conf and even if set to None it will be\n    passed as a string 'None' and will fail IPAddressField validation.\n    \n    graphics_listen_addrs in migration.py currently always returns a dict\n    which contains IP addresses of both VNC and spice graphics consoles.\n    \n    This means that:\n    * check 'if listen_addrs' is always True\n    * check 'if not listen_addrs' is always False\n    \n    So we really never passed through 'if not listen_addrs' since\n    migrate_data is objectified as those addresses are always there.\n    \n    However, serial_listen_addr is handled different way. The type of\n    this field in libvirt migrate data object is StringField that might\n    be set to None or empty string through nova.conf. So we still need\n    to validate whether serial console can be migrated so that we will\n    be sure that particular live migration will not break serial console\n    in case when serial listen address is not configured at destination.\n    \n    Change-Id: I73f7bfafa4554bf1c2dfc980289be88154170282\n    Closes-Bug: #1639312\n",
