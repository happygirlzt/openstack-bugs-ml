This turned out to be due to nova-network installing a SNAT rule for the cluster's public IP that applied to all network traffic, not just that traffic destined to exit towards the Internet.\n\nThis problem has been fixed upstream in https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/959c93f6d3572a189fc3fe73f1811c12323db857\n\nPlease consider applying this change to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in an SRU.",
