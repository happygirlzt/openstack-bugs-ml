You could argue that the server should refuse to create them without escaping, or that the client should escape them when displaying, or both. It's also not a guaranteed exploit (for example, it completely fails in my terminal, and would in many others).\n\nI feel like this would be best mitigated by neutering ANSI escape sequences in non-presentation-layer elements of all our client tools (probably by just refusing to pass raw 0x1b). However, it also seems like a security hardening opportunity since exploiting it would depend on the capabilities of the terminal in use by the victim and would be readily obvious to the victim in most cases even if it did succeed.",
