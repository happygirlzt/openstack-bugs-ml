I'd rather see a fix that identifies causes for an instance getting stuck in the REBOOTING_HARD state and attempts to rectify the stuck instance (either in a retry with timeout loop, or calling into the hypervisor itself to see what's up with the instance).",

One can reset ('hard reboot') a physical machine multiple times even if a reset is already in progress.
