Prior to this change the error message always mentioned\n    the name of the resource provider, even if it was not the cause of\n    the duplication. That's misleading and unfriendly.\n    \n    The new code will list the field and the value of the field that\n    was duplicated. From looking at the olso_db code that creates a\n    DBDuplicateEntry it appears that sometimes, but not always, the\n    exception could list both fields, so allowance for that is made\n    in the message output and the related gabbi tests.\n    \n    Because this changes the error message, but not the error response\n    code, this does not violate the api interoperability guidelines[1],\n    so I'm willing to say this doesn't require a microversion, and thus\n    does not require a spec.\n    \n    [1] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/api_interoperability.html\n    If we do think this is a violation, then the guideline should be\n    made more explicit.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibafbfd8302977a2b4e9250fbb5ada283b69d3c25\n    Closes-Bug: #1693349\n",
