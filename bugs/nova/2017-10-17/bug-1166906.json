    "description": "power_state mapping in powervm driver is incomplete resulting in VMs that are not able to boot reporting good state to compute manager.\n\nVery simple to recreate: simply add a corrupted powervm image to glance (I used a gzipped text file with raw extensions) and spawn the image. The result is that nova list show instance as available when in reality image is in Error or Open Firmware state.\n\nRecommended fix: Add a complete mapping from powervm power_state to nova compute power_state. Image to device copy can use some debug statements too to make it easier for a user to determine why instance is not booting.",
