The key problem is:  create a vm attached with volume , at the same time, in the same host delete other vms attached with volume.  This problem will be easy to appear.  The reason for the problem is:  the delete other vms operation will  find block devices from libvirt xmls, if  find libvirt xml  block devices are empty, it will run logout all iscsi  sessions and delete  nodes. But unfortunately, the creating vm may be just connect the volume, the block devices just generated and have no writed  libvirt XML, so,  the block devices was deleted with the above logout operation. Therefore, the vm will raise above exception .",
