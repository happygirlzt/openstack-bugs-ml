However exception class raised in both cases\n    is \"InvalidInstanceIDMalformed\" and EC2 error code is\n    InvalidInstanceID.Malformed.\n    \n    This patch addresses this problem by adding two new methods:\n    * validate_instance_id()\n    * validate_volume_id()\n    These methods use validate_ec2_id() and raise appropriate\n    exception as well as appropriate EC2 error code based on\n    AWS EC2 Error Code documentation:\n    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/api-error-codes.html\n    \n    Change-Id: I55591b8b643bb316e5001e645d71c13094106e96\n    Closes-Bug: #1199308\n",
