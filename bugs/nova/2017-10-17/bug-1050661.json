Once a failure is detected, a reconnection can be attempted.\n\nThe default for qpid_heartbeat was previously 5 seconds.  This is pretty\naggressive and can lead to invalid timeouts occuring.  An example is the\nnova-compute service.  It may block in native code (such as libvirt)\nunder normal circumstances.  When this happens, other greenthreads (such\nas the one responsible for sending the heartbeat) can not be scheduled.\nIt should be increased to something more reasonable, like 1 minute.",
