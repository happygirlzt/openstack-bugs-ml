On the system where we originally saw this the VM was running RHEL instead of Cirros, so the reboot was taking much longer.  The window to hit the timing issue is much smaller in devstack with Cirros.  Anyway, now that I can recreate I plan to spend some time working on this next week.\n\nThanks for your continued assistance on this as well!\nJay",
