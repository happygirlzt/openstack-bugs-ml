There are no problems with network, boot and virtual machine becomes accessible via ssh after test.\n\nThere is only one theoretical problem with this testcase running on remotefs-based cinder drivers - snapshots are not safe, because qemu agent is missing in cirros image, but since VM log shows, that VM booted successfully, it is not the reason of fails.",
