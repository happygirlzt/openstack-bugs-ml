Below is some of my findings.\n\n1. disk_info is not passed to finish_migration, thus no disk resize operation is even attempted. \nAt https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L6036, network type isn't considered a valid disk type and migrate_disk_and_power_off uses this code to load the disk info that will be eventually feeded to finish_migration to determine if a disk resize is required, https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L6401 . \n\n\n2. resizing rbd backed disk is not supported \n\nEven if disk_info is successfully passed to finish_migration, the _disk_resize function invoked at https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L6404 doesn't support rbd backed disk. All it does at the end is a qemu-img resize call - https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/disk/api.py#L190. \n\n\nHope it helps.\n\nThank,\nLiang",

Splitting the create and resize operations into two discrete methods takes care of that, and is handled in the patch set https://review.openstack.org/187857\n\nOn point #2, you are absolutely correct, there is no actual support on the backend for this, and it's amazing to me that it was released in this state.  The support is added in patch set https://review.openstack.org/187395\n\nThanks,",

I have tried it with both Trusty Liberty and Trusty Mitaka (which has the same version as Xenial) i.e. boot a vm using a flavor that has a root and ephemeral disk, and the vm boots us just fine. For clarity I have tried with (default) qcow2 imagebackend as well as the raw and rbd imagebackends without any problems at all. Could you please describe the sequence that you have used to trigger your problem and provide some logs?\n\nAs a side note, the patch backported here already exists in Mitaka and beyond so if it really does introduce a regression then we should first check if there is a fix from upstream that we can backport to fix this issue and if not then we should propose it ourselves otherwise we are fixing one version but leaving the next broken.",
