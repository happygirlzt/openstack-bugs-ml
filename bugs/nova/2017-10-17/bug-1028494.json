Basically my change seems to pass most of the unit tests but is somehow preventing new instances from launching (clearly a big deal). I'm not really sure how to debug it further due to my unfamiliarity with the system. Any thoughts?\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps more a topic for the mailing list, I'm not sure how to write a test for the database methods. It seems like the unit test queries are faked so nova.db.sqlalchemy.api.instance_type_get_all() is never entered into or checked accurately. Should I be writing an additional test to somehow check this function?\n\nCheers,\nJosh",
