This avoids to get inside the \"if\" block in the future iterations (as progress_watermark=0 is never bigger than info.data_remaining), and thus not updating neither the progress_watermark, nor the progress_time from that point. \n\nThis may lead to (unneeded) abort migrations due to progress_time not being updated, making (now - progress_time) > progress_timeout.\n\nIt can be fixed just by modifying the if clause to be like:\n    if ((progress_watermark is None) or\n        (progress_watermark == 0) or\n        (progress_watermark > info.data_remaining)):",
