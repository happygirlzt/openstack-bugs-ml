            "content": "Gary, also, to be clear, the original original bug was I wanted to change the pass to NotImplementedError in the powervm driver specifically to make tempest fail when using powervm and running tests against unimplemented APIs, because otherwise we were getting false positives.  The problem was when I implemented that, it caused the compute service to fail on startup, so I had to revert back to pass (from raise NotImplementedError) and I added a debug log message (which wasn't in the powervm driver initially).  That was a short-term fix for havana and I discussed it with Joe Gordon - he thought it was better to revert rather than try to tackle handling NotImplementedError in the compute manager late in havana.  That is the impetus of this bug - to go back to raising NotImplementedError rather than pass but handle it properly in the compute manager.",
