    "description": "This is a somewhat complex setup, but using an external gateway it is best if fixed network traffic is bridged untouched and floating network traffic is routed out through the public interface. The current iptables/ebtables setup forces bridged traffic to be routed if it is going to the networks listed in force_snat_range. This causes the snat for the routing_source_ip to be hit. This all works fine if  /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables is set to 0.\n\nUnfortunately if the above sysctl is set to 1 then the bridged traffic also hits the fallback rule and is snatted as well. A small change would allow us to support both versions, which is: if force_snat_range is set, only do the fallback routing for those networks. This allows the bridged traffic to fall through and not get touched by the SNAT rules.",
