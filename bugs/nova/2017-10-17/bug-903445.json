    "description": "Currently we don't have a clean xapi backend that exclusively handles storage requirements for ISO images on local disk (an ext based Local storage SR). We have an ISOSR.py under /opt/xensource/sm that is more of an NFS ISO repository client. As part of this bug, we will be checking in a simplified backend LocalISOSR.py script written by Ewan Mellor, that will act as a xapi backend for clients like nova-compute that wish to carve out VHDs from VDIs on an ext based Local storage SR. A script to create an SR of type ISO on a freshly installed xenserver with ext based Local Storage SR, plus necessary packaging changes will also be checked in.",
