In\n    most cases these seem to recover nicely just\n    with a simple retry of the lvremove.  Adding\n    a udev settle seems to elimate the rest of them.\n    \n    This is a difficult issue to reproduce, and there's\n    a suspiscion that it relates to failed target\n    creeates.\n    \n    The patch adds a catch on the lvremove failure,\n    followed by a udevadm settle and a retry of the\n    lvremove.  With the setup that I've been able\n    to reproduce this issue these changes have eliminated\n    any force delete failures.\n    \n    The other option that had been proposed was using dmsetup remove\n    but there are concerns that this may cause problems.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2a2b0d0f4fefd0daf9424ab96aaf87ba53ebc171\n    Closes-Bug: #1191960\n",
