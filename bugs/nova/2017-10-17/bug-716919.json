The endpoint IP is built from FLAGS.ec2_host, which should be set to a public IP.\n\nDebugging the issue, it appears that nova-api runs with the following flag values:\nmy_ip = 192.168.0.111\nec2_host = 0.0.0.0\n\nAll other components correctly use ec2_host = my_ip = 192.168.0.111, but for some reason nova-api doesn't.",

We'll need to fix nova-combined as well, and cover s/ec2/osapi/",
