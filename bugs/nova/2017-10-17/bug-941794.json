As we're setting tap device for an instance up, libvirt can't change mac address for this interface which prevent instance from starting. \n\nThere's another huge bug with this integration code. After machine is rebooted we're loosing all tap interfaces for instances and there's no code to recreate them. Solutions for this is to use libvirt_vif_type=bridge .

            "content": "Hi, Clarifications to the points raised here have been provided on the NetStack mailer. \n\n* The behavior of the VIF driver for Quantum is different from the VIF driver that is used within Nova for plugging into a Linux bridge (when using a VLAN-NetworkManager). \n\n* The gateway initialization happens in a separate driver, please take a look at the QuantumLinuxBridgeInterfaceDriver class inside:\nnova/network/linux_net.py\nBridge and tap devices are created only after the first VM is created on a particular Quantum network.\n\n* The bridge is not designed to be deleted during unplug, it will be deleted only when the network is deleted.\n\n* As for the suggestion on using the interface type bridge, that would work only if plug is called only once in the lifetime of a VM. Quantum tries to support semantics beyond that; one should be able to plug a VIF into a port, may be unplug at a later time, plug into a port on a separate network, and so on. One way to achieve this is by using the interface type ethernet (and that\u2019s where the agent comes into play, hence it's required).\n\nIn summary, currently, these drivers are working as designed and integration is not broken.",
