    "description": "This is purely based on code inspection, but the compute API method 'evacuate' does not check if the specified host (if there was one) is different from instance.host. It checks if the service is up on that host, which could be down and you can still specify the instance.host.\n\nEventually the compute API will RPC cast to conductor task manager which will fail with an RPC error trying to RPC cast to the ComputeManager.rebuild_instance method on the compute service, which is down.\n\nThe bug here is that instead of getting an obvious 400 error from the API, you're left with not much for details when it fails. There should be an instance action and finish event, but only the admin can see the traceback in the event. Also, the instance.task_state would be left in 'rebuilding' state, and would require it to be reset to use the instance again.",
