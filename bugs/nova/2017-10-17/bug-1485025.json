There were a few\n    tests that relied on how instance.get_flavor() used to work with\n    system_metadata and since that's not really valid anymore, we change\n    those tests to just raise a NotFound from instance.get_flavor() if we're\n    testing some other lookup path.  As a result, two of the tests became\n    basically the same so one was removed.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1485025\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie6b3c470619bd67871b49e75af8044f173bed615\n",
