But it's missed to reset in function mount() and\n    teardown().\n    \n    This patch is to fix it. We now just return the device name when\n    mounting disk image during setting up container and remove the\n    member variable 'device' from Class _DiskImage added in last patch.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1243108\n    Related-bug: #1208387\n    \n    Change-Id: I2aaed6f3367edce4fb23b78f0e979440954609a8\n",
