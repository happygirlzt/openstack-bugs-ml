If LUN0 is not queried (attached in the case of Nova), other volumes are not properly becoming available in the guest.\n\nIn practice, you cannot attach a volume to /dev/sdc if a volume hasn't been attached to /dev/sdb before (/dev/sda is the root volume / local disk connected to the IDE channel).\n\nHere's a Linux Kernel patch that works around this issue, although it didn't merge yet:\nhttp://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg65056.html",

Both are in use state.\n e) deleted the instance VM1\n f) Checked the cinder status. Both the volumes are in available state.\n \nPlease let me know whether I missed any steps.\n",
