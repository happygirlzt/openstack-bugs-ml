The NoValidHost\n    exception's message will be logged before reporting that\n    the machine went to error. Previously, all other exceptions\n    would show a stack trace. However, since the NoValidHost case\n    is skipped, a user may not understand why his/her machine\n    went to an ERROR state. This patch seeks to remove any\n    confusion.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0f01b1095251f5c659fe010c7376f3f6bc56babe\n    Closes-Bug: 1336977\n",
