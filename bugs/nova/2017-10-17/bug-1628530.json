Looking at it I see the issue which is that on a reschedule there is no BuildRequest object in the db so the logic that checks for that will stop the build attempt from progressing further. That code is in place to handle the case where a delete happens during the build process but did not properly account for reschedules.\n\nIn the case of a reschedule instance.launched_on will be set so we can bypass looking for the BuildRequest object in that case. Since the BuildRequest was deleted during the first scheduling pass it's okay to do that.",
