In order for live migration to work properly, you must configure the graphics (VNC and/or SPICE) listen addresses to be either the catch-all address (0.0.0.0 or ::) or the local address (127.0.0.1 or ::1).\n\n\nEnvironment:\n\n* Multi-node OpenStack-Ansible deploy.\n\n* Nova from git (commit 32b7526b3cf40f40c5430034f75444fc64ac0e04).\n\n* Libvirt + KVM",
