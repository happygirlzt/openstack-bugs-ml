    "description": "The Hyper-V driver has a few issues when attempting to use shared storage for the instance files.\n\nMigration issues\n----------------\nIn case of migrations, we attempt to move the instance files without checking whether shared storage is used. Note that the block_migration flag is completely ignored.\n\nDuring live migrations, we let Hyper-V automatically detect whether shared storage is used or not. This seems to be troublesome when instance files reside on CSVs.\n\nAfter a live migration is performed, we always try to delete the instance files. Also, if the migration fails, the destination node is not cleaned up, as the HyperVLiveMigrateData object is not used at the moment.\n\nImage/path handling issues\n--------------------------\nThe image cache operation uses thread locks, for which reason it is prone to race conditions when using shared storage. Switching to file locks would solve this issue.\n\nUsing UNC paths for the instance path does not work either. The driver will fail to fetch the available space. Also, it will not build the remote instance path properly when trying to move files during migrations.",
