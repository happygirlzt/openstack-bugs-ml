If the PCI requests match one or more pools, the number of devices will be subtracted from the total number of devices available in those pools.\n\nOn the compute node, PCI device allocation is performed based on the list of free devices that are available on the node. The PCI requests are used to match against the device itself, rather than the pci stats pools.\n\nThe unsymmetrical handling of scheduling versus allocating could cause incorrect pci stats, and thus incorrect scheduling, and nova instances failed to boot.",

This makes sure that PCI devices are\n    allocated out of the same stats pools that are used by the nova scheduler to\n    satisfy the PCI requests. And therefore, stats pools on the compute nodes will\n    be kept in sync with their counterparts in the nova scheduler.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2d97c6354215e2ac5ff659e3203c33771abe1c09\n    Closes-bug: #1288809\n",
