This\n    is especially true when lazy translation is enabled, since it\n    causes the exception message to be translated immediately using\n    the default locale.\n    \n    This is the same problem caused by using str on exceptions,\n    which was fixed by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/116054/\n    \n    In addition to fixing these cases, this patch updates\n    hacking check N325, which checks for the use of str() on\n    exceptions, to also check for the use of unicode().\n    \n    In order to make it clear which cases that cannot be caught\n    by the hacking check have been inspected, they have been\n    converted to using six.text_type() instead of unicode().\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1380806\n    Change-Id: I87bb94fa76458e028beba28d092320057b53f70a\n",
