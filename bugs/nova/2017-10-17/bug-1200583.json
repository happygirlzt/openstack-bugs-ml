The problem here is that I only get a black VNC window, and no console log output. I am able to connect to the XEN guests using SSH from some other guests running on KVM, so except the described problem, the guest looks like it is running.\n\nThe same problem is described here by someone else: https://lists.launchpad.net/openstack/msg03573.html\n\nAlso in the log files I see this:\n# cat /var/log/xen/qemu-dm-instance-00000089.log\ndomid: 1\nWarning: vlan 0 is not connected to host network\nchar device redirected to /dev/pts/4\nxs_read(): target get error. /local/domain/1/target.\nxs_read(): vncpasswd get error. /vm/3cb151cb-8a83-4736-bcce-a9b845da297d/vncpasswd.\nchar device redirected to /dev/pts/5",
