    "description": "Since bug 703041 was fixed and merged into trunk, at least 3 new cases where localized strings have been added that incorrectly use positional formatting instead of dict/mapping formatting. There is nothing to prevent even more from being added in the future.\n\nTo fix this, a unit test needs to be added that detects such strings and reports them so that they can be corrected. Any incorrect strings currently in trunk should also be fixed.",
