As such, its a\n    normal but rare condition for a bare metal node to refer to a deleted\n    (and even garbage collected) nova instance. We should treat such\n    instances are deleted rather than erroring on any call through\n    list_instances(), permitting starting new instances and listing\n    instances to work - fixing bug: 1096722.\n    \n    Pathologically, the database may suffer permanent skew, which means we\n    need a way to fix it (and thats tracked as a separate bug).\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic21ff66b1fc0ad64bb5feff26291873b96d20e4e\n",
