It is nova-compute instances that are backend-specific.\n\nI guess your problem is with choosing between BM and VM nodes. You can use, for example, host aggregates to distinguish between these. I suggest you reach out to the Nova team for better explanation.",

The better bet would be to wait for CellsV2 and deploy VMs in one region and BMs in another.  That approach will most likely do what you want easily.\n\nTo put this another way, I think what you're asking is a feature request.  It's certainly in the realm of Nova.",
