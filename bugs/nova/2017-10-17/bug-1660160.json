The ComputeNode records are very fundamental to Nova and have been for years, before cellsv2 was even a thing.\n\nWithout the compute node records, the discover_hosts step will not be able to create HostMapping records for the compute nodes, which is what the \"No host-to-cell mapping\" message is about.\n\nSo, this is, IMHO, not a Nova bug but just something config-related on the tripleo side. I'm not sure what exactly would cause that compute node record create failure, but I expect it's something minor.",
