This has some justification as key may be downloaded only at build time and later changes will be ignored by instance.\n\nBut this is not a case for rebuild command. If tenant want to rebuild instance, he may wants to change key used to access that instance.\n\nMain reason for 'rebuild' command instead of 'delete/create' often lies in area of preserving network settings - fixed ips, mac addresses, assosiated floatings IPs. Normally user want to keep the same ssh key as at creation time, but occasionally he (she) may want to replace it.\n\nRight now there is no such option.\n\nTL;DR; Please add --key-name option to nova rebuild command (and API).\n\nThanks.",

We only use Launchpad bugs for getting the list of *bugs* that are existing (or existed) and we don't generally use the Wishlist status for getting the list of features we want to work on (even if we still have wishlist bugs in our project page, but that's just for legacy reasons).\n\nPlease look at http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/process.html#how-do-i-get-my-code-merged for understanding how to help Nova.\n\nTriaging this bug report as Invalid then, please open a blueprint and create a Nova-specs change given it would need an API modification.",
