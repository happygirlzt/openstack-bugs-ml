For more info see\n    http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsOSBIOS. Currently the boot\n    element is hard coded to \"hd\" by the libvirt driver.\n    \n    This patch makes it possible to specify more than one boot element that\n    will give us more flexibility.\n    \n    Related-bug: 1229327\n    Change-Id: I38abe9edaa8f93469d58ad81a466f68c2c0d24d6\n",
