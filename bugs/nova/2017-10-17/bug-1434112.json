But lets see what other folks think.\n    \n    The rest of it seems OK, I am just glad to see it clearly optional, I suppose.\n    \n    Most periodic tasks do this:\n    \n    db_instances = objects.InstanceList.get_by_host(\n    context, self.host, expected_attrs=[], use_slave=True)\n    \n    But maybe lets just raise a bug and fix that in a follow on patch. Not sure\n    what stuff you need merging in for the sync, you might need the flavor in\n    system_metadata I guess, but we could add use_slave I think.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    Change-Id: I998b6ac0ad6fd53769061ef66b9b19ba5e12391d\n    Closes-Bug: #1434112\n",
