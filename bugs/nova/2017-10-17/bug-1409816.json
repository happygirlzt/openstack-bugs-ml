When attempting to list the networks with `nova network-list` in order to select a network nova returns a 404.\n\nTalked to mriedem briefly about this and he pointed to http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#n1034 which is where nova proxies to neutron for that info. There is also a test in tempest http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/tempest/tree/tempest/api/compute/test_networks.py#n31 but it apparently doesn't work against nova with neutron.\n\nNote that using `neutron net-list` does properly list the available networks so this appears to be an issue with nova's proxying of neutron's api.",
