    "description": "Hard-rebooting an instance causes the root_device_name to get ignored/reset, which can cause wailing and gnashing of teeth if the guest operating system is expecting it to not do that.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Stand up a devstack\n2. Load the openrc with admin credentials\n3. glance image-update --property root_device_name=sda SOME_CIRROS_IMAGE\n4. Spawn a cirros instance using the above image. The root filesystem should present as being mounted on /dev/sda1, and the libvirt.xml should show the disk with a target of \"scsi\"\n5. Hard-reboot the instance\n\nExpected Behaviour\n\nThe instance comes back up with the same hardware configuration as it had when initially spawned, i.e., with its root filesystem attached to a SCSI bus\n\nActual Behaviour\n\nThe instance comes back with its root filesystem attached to an IDE bus.",
