This comes\n    from the Ironic virt driver _node_resource method which eventually\n    gets used in the resource tracker to set the ComputeNode\n    hypervisor_hostname field, which is used to also set the instance.node\n    value in the ResourceTracker later during the instance claim.\n    \n    The confusion probably lies in the fact that the variable passed\n    around the code is also referred to as \"nodename\", but in the case\n    of Ironic it's not actually a hostname, it's a uuid.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic639abe9989b282bad71581bb861314619c0f48b\n    Closes-Bug: #1698000\n",
