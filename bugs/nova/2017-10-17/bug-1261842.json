Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Dec 17 17:20:48 2013 +0000\n\n    Add hacking test to block cross-virt driver code usage\n    \n    The baremetal driver has been accessing some libvirt driver\n    private classes and config variables. Any code that is intended\n    to be shared across virt drivers should be in a common package\n    instead. Add a hacking file to enforce this for imports and\n    config options so that no further problems like this are made\n    in the future.\n    \n    NB, this skips verification of the baremetal driver until\n    bugs 1261826 and 1261827 are fixed, or the baremetal driver is\n    removed, whichever comes first.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifbfe597795795a847830f9bd937dc459cd37d118\n    Closes-Bug: #1261842\n",
