This happens when sync_power_states checks this instance and this instance is just rebooting for some reason (issued by scripts or users from within then instance).  Hypervisor is libvirt/XEN. \nIn libvirt/XEN the instance has status PAUSED for a short time when it it is rebooted from within. _sync_power_states shutes every machine down wich is in PAUSED state. So we should wait for a short time an recheck if machine is still in PAUSED-state before shuting it down .",
