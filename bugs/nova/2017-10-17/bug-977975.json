I am assuming that we actually want to transition\n    these tables across to using the instance UUID instead of just the\n    ID.\n    \n    This is my first attempt at a schema update, so please review this\n    patch with skepticism. Resolves bug 977975. Partially resolves\n    blueprint finish-uuid-conversion.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib5a6f8a872ea0530e201c70e9ac01cd14f82c557\n",
