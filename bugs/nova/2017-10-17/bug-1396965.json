From what I gathered in #openstack-nova, being able to detach root device volume in shutoff state can be a useful ability, but adding it back should be done with careful checking around it, to prevent guest damage.",

            "content": "I second the issue here. There are several use cases where having the ability is crucial for operation. Changing a MAC / IP address can be prohibitive in some environment. Consider setups where security is relevant and any changes need to go through a manual review process or when you are using provider nets with interconnects to real existing devices (like RSA token server, etc.) where you just can't have systems change their mac and/or ip addresses.\n\nYou need the ability in such cases.\n\nHere's a manual workaround (read: hack) to make it work. I am actually in the process of codifying this into our tooling as this is something we need and cannot wait another year until someone re-enables this.\n\nI write this down here in the hope that it may help others stuck here. Note that perhaps not all these steps are necessary for you. They are for us as we're booting from volumes generated from snapshotted images (on ceph)  ie: on nova show serverId I have \"Attempt to boot from volume - no image supplied\" in the image columns.\n\n- Detaching:\n first ensure VM is stopped\n cinder reset-state --state available oldVolumeId\n mysql cinder 'delete from volume_attachment where volume_id = oldVolumeId';\n mysql cinder 'update volumes set attachment_status=\"detached\" where id = oldVolumeId';\n mysql nova 'delete from block_device_mapping where not deleted and volume_id = oldVolumeId';\n nova volume-attach serverId newVolumeId\n cinder delete oldVolumeId\n mysql nova 'update block_device_mapping set device_name = \"/dev/vda\" where instance_uuid = serverId';\n\nNow very important, you need to execute this to regenerate the libvirt xml file (it would have bad disk references and would not start otherwise):\n\nnova reboot --hard serverId\n\nNow you should have the new volume mounted, the old deleted (obviously omit that step if you need to keep it) and the vm booting with the new one.\n\nThings that I noticed. Prior to this process, nova volume-detach server volume failes with the known root volume cannot be removed message. Afterwards this procedure it works. For some reason nova thinks the volume is vdb (ie second volume). You see this if you do a volume-detach then volume-attach where it will always be displayed as vdb and you will always need to do the update device mapping to vda and nova reboot --hard to make it start. If anyone knows where to kick nova so that it will accept this new volume as root / vda, I'll happily amend the procedure.\n\nI hope this is useful information until this bug results in working volume-attach / detach for root volumes again.",

            "content": "After working half of the day on this issue on my local installation, if all you want to do is to detach a root volume, two updates in mysql are sufficient:\n\nuse cinder;\nupdate volume_attachment set mountpoint='/dev/vdb' where volume_id = 'oldVolumeId' and deleted = 0;\nuse nova;\nupdate block_device_mapping set device_name = '/dev/vdb', boot_index=1 where volume_id = 'oldVolumeId' and deleted = 0;\n\nbasically the mountpoint/device name must not be /dev/vda and boot_index must not be 0. If this is true, you can successfully remove the volume using\nnova volume-detach <instanceId> <volumeId>.\n\nTo attach another volume, do the same thing in reverse after having used nova volume-attach. That is, set the name back to /dev/vda and set the boot_index to 0 for the new volume. Basically below:\n\nuse cinder;\nupdate volume_attachment set mountpoint='/dev/vda' where volume_id = 'shinyNewVolumeId' and deleted = 0;\nuse nova;\nupdate block_device_mapping set device_name = '/dev/vda', boot_index=0 where volume_id = 'shinyNewVolumeId' and deleted = 0;\n\nThen again use the magic incantation:\n\nnova reboot --hard <instanceId>\n\nto force a fresh and correct libvirt config for the instance being created.\n",

Adding the ability to detach and attach boot volumes was discussed in the Liberty design summit here: https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/YVR-nova-contributor-meetup#43 \n\nI took an action then to write up a spec but got delayed, so it was pushed out to address in Mitaka, see: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1396965\n\nThe notes in the etherpad above a very brief but sum up some of the problems that will need to be addressed. The good news is that the volume attach and detach operations are already there and work for volumes attached as root devices. If you change the conditional in detach_volume() in the volumes API you will be allowed to do it. Attach requires a slight change to the naming to make sure it goes back as the root device.\n\nThe things to address are to do with notifications in case it affects billing etc., making operations on the instance safe, how to set the state of the instance and the volumes..... We intend to address all these as part of the spec. Please review it and see if it meets you needs.\n\nThanks,\npaul",
