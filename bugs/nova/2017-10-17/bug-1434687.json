Without\n    vol_get_usage_by_time being in conductor manager it's an API pointing to\n    nothing and won't work so we should remove it.\n    \n    The DB APIs are left in since the vol_usage_update DB API is tested\n    using vol_get_usage_by_time.\n    \n    If we were to leave the conductor APIs in tree, we should add the\n    conductor manager method back in and convert the volume_usages table to\n    nova objects, and possibly also expose it via a v2.1 API extension.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1434687\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie2980d681c62cd3457b359fbe4f5c32a2bcfc5db\n",
