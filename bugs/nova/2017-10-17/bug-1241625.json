Garcia <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Oct 17 23:38:19 2013 +0000\n\n    Enable non-ascii characters in flavor names\n    \n    The current implementation provided under commit e6b42d made it so that\n    flavor names did not have special characters (e.g. *&^%$ etc. except for\n    -._ and space) however it also limited names to only ascii letters.\n    \n    This patch makes it so that special characters are still not allowed,\n    except the ones currently allowed, but it allows the use of non-ascii\n    characters so that flavor names can be created in locales other than\n    English.\n    \n    Change-Id: I056451a5e8b7a49f86e0a11d0011393dc769db34\n    Closes-bug: #1241625\n",
