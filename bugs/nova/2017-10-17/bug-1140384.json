    "description": "Currently, test_api_samples.py, when used w/ the GENERATE_SAMPLES=True flag, generates a zero-length file for those response template files that don't exist. In my opinion this needs to be improved as it then requires a manual copy of the template file to the sample file by the developer writing the samples.\n\nI am proposing to have the test framework, only in cases of responses, copy the sample file to its corresponding template location if and only if the template file does not already exist.\n\nBy doing this, the developer:\n- does not have to make the manual copy, and, only if necessary, modify the template file to add regexs.\n- is less prone to end up with a template body which looks different (in the order things are listed) than the response body.",

It takes two runs of this module now\n      to get those files first populated.\n    - Fix error labels to now specify whether we are referring to\n      a sample or response when comparing response results\n    - Call _pretty_data() only once on sample_data before this\n      param is passed to _compare_results(). This change cut the\n      total execution time by .5 seconds or 1%. :)\n    - Create response template files which content is the same as\n      its response body instead of currently 0-length body.\n    Fixes bug 1140384\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic62ae343409b2084e6a238025a86f0b7909a1b76\n",
