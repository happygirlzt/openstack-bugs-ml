However, we're currently taking snapshots of two of those instances. If we filter on task_state != None, then we'd get the warning in:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/4ad414f3b1216393301ef268a64e61ca1a3d5be9/nova/compute/manager.py#L6180\n\nEven though the instances are on the hypervisor.\n\nI think the thing we need to warn about is if there are more instances for that host in the DB than what's in the hypervisor, so change:\n\nif num_vm_instances != num_db_instances:\n\nto\n\nif num_vm_instances < num_db_instances:",
