The original comment regarding the\n    pre_live_migration requiring Fixed IP Addresses alluded to uncertainty\n    about it not being required.  Workloads should not require a Fixed IP\n    Address for migration, typically just the storage is required to be\n    similar.\n    \n    The commit also updates the associated test case to ensure that no\n    exception is thrown in the pre_live_migration if a fixed IP Address\n    is not specified.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2c4d4dae2cb0f00c67f0f731b5080196564b37da\n    Closes-Bug: #1226226\n",
