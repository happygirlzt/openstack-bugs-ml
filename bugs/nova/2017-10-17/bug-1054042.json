            "content": "Well I a few things that are problematic with this. First of all, tenants should be separated if you use VLANs. I see that it is expected by tenants that nobody can get into their network (be it L2 or L3). Security group rules help, but one can get sloppy with them. If tenants need to communicate with each other, they can communicate via external IPs. As I see it, other tenants are \"external\" to the network, and should use the same mechanisms of accessing the network as anybody else.\n\nThe second thing is that admins have an expectation that the users are separated from the internal admin networks. Now all users have direct access to any internal networks one might have. The problem can be mitigated, but users should definately not have easy access to admin networks.\n\nI guess much of the issue goes away with Quantum, but for Essex with nova-network I would argue that this is a problem.",
