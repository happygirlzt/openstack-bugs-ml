For example, in that same file, the _instance_supported method has:\n\n            # grab the architecture from glance\n            architecture = image['properties'].get('architecture', 'Unknown')\n\nand the nova/scheduler/filters/image_props_filter.py:instance_supported method has:\n\n        img_arch = image_props.get('architecture', None)",
