Currently - nova would just create them on the destination node.\n\nTwo possible solutions are:\n\n1) Prevent non-block live migration without shared storage - effectively reverting  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/17118/\n2) Allow live migration ONLY for volume backed instances that have no local disks. This might be a preferred way of solving the issue, as there is value in having the flexibility to have live migrations without the overhead of setting up shared storage for volume-only VMs",
