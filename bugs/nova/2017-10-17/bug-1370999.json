This\n    means a reboot might happen after resetnetwork.\n    \n    A reboot happens when polling for the version. Until now we wait for the\n    call timeout, before fetching the new dom id. This change ensures that\n    if we spot a reboot, the plugin exits early rather than keeping polling\n    the wrong dom id.\n    \n    Turns out its best to wait for the dom_id to change, before trying\n    to poll the agent again. Once the dom_id in xenapi has been updated,\n    the xenstore keys are always in place.\n    \n    Trying too early leads to lots of reboot detections because we are\n    retrying with the old dom_id. XenServer continues to return the old\n    dom_id for a little while after the reboot.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1370999\n    \n    Change-Id: Id0bf5b64f2b271d162db5bbce50167ab1f665c87\n",
