Which is not caught and therefore returned to\n    the user.\n    \n    This is because the generator function (_get_serial_ports_from_instance)\n    is not *executed* under try/except.  While that is clearly the intent of the\n    code.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9e9410ab7eec5fa667c0c3de4548c49df050c167\n    Closes-Bug: 1480514\n",
