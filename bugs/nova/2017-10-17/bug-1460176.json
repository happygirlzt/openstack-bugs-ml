The change to 'network_allocated' would be written to\n    the DB but not updated on the instance object. When the network\n    was cleaned up before a reschedule, the object would not notice\n    network_allocated' getting set to False, and not write the change\n    to the DB. After the reschedule, the instance would still have\n    'network_allocated' set to True, and skip allocating a network.\n    The node would go active with no network.\n    \n    Since this is happening in the _allocate_network_async greenthread,\n    the solution is not to save in the async thread. The main thread\n    and the async thread share a reference to the same object and the\n    main thread waits for the async thread to finish before the final\n    save, so saving is unnecessary. I added comments on the\n    instance.save() calls that were part of the race so they don't get\n    removed or changed and reintroduce this bug.\n    \n    Also, update the relevant test from mox to mock.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1460176\n    \n    Change-Id: I937ec020b46703392bd603008d03af0f422bc0d1\n    (cherry picked from commit 717aa88f14e549d9e5d8b252ba7128e3dac991b6)\n",
