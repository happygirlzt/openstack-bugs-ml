    "description": "OpenStack Grizzly on Ubuntu 12.04, Multi host setup.\n\nI'm creating 3 different networks:\n\n# nova-manage network create --label compute-1 --fixed_range_v4 192.168.1.0/27 --num_networks 1 --network_size 32\n# nova-manage network create --label compute-2 --fixed_range_v4 192.168.2.0/27 --num_networks 1 --network_size 32\n# nova-manage network create --label compute-3 --fixed_range_v4 192.168.3.0/27 --num_networks 1 --network_size 32\n\nNot every compute node may use every network because they are distributed over different data centers. So I need to associate the hosts to the networks:\n\n# nova-manage network modify --host=compute-1 192.168.1.0/27\n# nova-manage network modify --host=compute-2 192.168.2.0/27\n# nova-manage network modify --host=compute-3 192.168.3.0/27\n\n1. Issue\n\nNow, when I call the following command:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0`nova boot --image <uuid> --flavor m1.medium --availability-zone eu-central-1 test`\n\nThe created VM gets 3 NICs due to the multinic feature. But in fact, only one network is suitable because the other 2 networks aren't even associated with the hosts.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nI need to specify the host and the network.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0`nova boot --image --nic net-id=<uuid-of-net-on-compute-1> <uuid> --flavor m1.medium --availability-zone eu-central-1:compute-1 test`\n\nUnfortunately this bypasses some useful scheduling balancer algorithms.\n\n2.
