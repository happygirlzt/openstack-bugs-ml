However, support for using this script was left out of the Nova and Neutron projects purely due to negligence. mm-ctl is the correct way to bind ports but because we have not been doing this, it has caused problems occasionally. This fix is to change Nova to properly set up port bindings to use the \"midonet\" vif driver when creating a port. Lack of mm-ctl support also causes issues with clients that required upstream vif driver support.",

However, support\n    for using this script is left out of the nova and neutron projects. This causes\n    confusion and makes deployments unnecessarily complicated for customers using\n    Havana. This fix is to change nova to properly use mm-ctl. Corresponding\n    changes will be submitted to devstack and neutron.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7c9edded5ab6fe19b63e54cd6905d9242e4a90cc\n    Closes-Bug: 1235132\n",
