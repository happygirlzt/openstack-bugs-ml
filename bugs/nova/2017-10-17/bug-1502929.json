    "description": "There is a bug when connecting to Cinder volumes over iSCSI with XenAPI where a tapdisk is not correctly spawned.  This has been fixed in https://github.com/xapi-project/sm/commit/7a8a158493d03ceeb31bc8a43b7f213e74420bf0 however, users of XenServer 6.5 need a workaround in Nova.\n\nThe impact of this is that, without the fix, XAPI is expecting a tapdisk to be spawned, but the Storage Manager does not spawn one.  As such, the VM will not be able to connect to this Cinder volume, and may connect to a different volume on the same host.\n\nThe correct fix in Nova is to emulate the above commit for users of XenServer 6.5; i.e. set the backend-kind=vbd.  This will ensure that the storage manager spawns a tapdisk, and that it can be attached in the correct way",

Different volume within the same project? or just a different volume on the host regardless of project_id?",
