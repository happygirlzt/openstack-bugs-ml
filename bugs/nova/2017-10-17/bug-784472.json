    "description": "In nova/image/s3.py, we pull the image out of nova-objectstore, decrypt it, and put it into the real image service (e.g. glance). Along the way, we set a custom image property image_state a couple of times to track the progress in this process. This is because glance (rightfully!) has fewer states (active, killed, queued, and saving). Once this process is completed, image_state is set to \"available\".\n\nThe EC2 api knows about this extra state and so knows when the image is ready. However, the OpenStack API does not. It relies exclusively on the \"status\" attribute of the image.\n\nWe should use image_state only to track the intermediate states of the image. Once the image is \"available\", it shoudl be marked \"active\" and the image_state is obsolete and can be dropped.",
