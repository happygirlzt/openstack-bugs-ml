There are other sings in the console log about the block device was not detected.\n\njgriffith: The issue is NOT an ssh issue, the vda is not visible on the guest. the instance even did not reached the state when it tries to  set up addresses for the interfaces.\n\nPlease be aware we are directly injecting the  kernel and the initramfs to the vm memory, so those part can work with a working block device. We see the issue when the system really tries to touch the block device.",
