    "description": "Currently the three overcommit ratios: ram_allocation_ratio,  cpu_allocation_ratio, and disk_allocation_ratio can be set to negative values.\n\nNova scheduler filters (e.g. CoreFilter) will use these ratios to calculate free_vcpus/free_ram_mb/usable_disk_mb (which is negative) and therefore scheduler filters will eventually filter out node which has negative overcommit ratio.\n\nIt makes more sense that these 3 ratios values should not be able to set to negative values.  If any of these ratios is negative then nova-compute service should fail to start.\n\nStep to reproduce on devstack:\n\n* On compute node, modify /etc/nova/nova.conf to have \"cpu_allocation_ratio = -1.0\"\n* Restart nova-compute (n-cpu) and nova-compute service is up and running (we should expect nova-compute to fail to start)",
