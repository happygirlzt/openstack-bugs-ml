This particular nova bug has actually kept us off using the ubuntu cloud archive, which means we're not testing any other libvirt >= 1.x bits as well, which means there are a lot of other places we could be breaking that we don't know about yet.\n\nI think that Kenichi's approach of actually checking for the attr is the right approach, and remove testing for this feature by version at all. Honestly moving to a model where we are not testing by version but instead by feature seems more sane.",

This went unnoticed because unattended-upgrade job does not upgrade from unofficial repositories unless explicitly whitelisted, so it wasn't until early this morning when we approved http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/commit/?id=0385b96 that apt-get ended up pulling libvirt-dev and its dependencies from Ubuntu Cloud Archive rather than main that this came to light.\n\nThe ensuing mayhem was resolved by merging http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/commit/?id=7282ca4 and then using salt.run to execute the following on all precise.* slaves:\n\n    rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudarchive.list\n    apt-get update\n    apt-get install -y --force-yes \\\n        libvirt-bin=0.9.8-2ubuntu17.16 \\\n        libvirt-dev=0.9.8-2ubuntu17.16 \\\n        libvirt0=0.9.8-2ubuntu17.16 \\\n        libxenstore3.0=4.1.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 \\\n        libxen-dev=4.1.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.2\n\nSince then, subsequent unit tests are back to using old libvirt in CI and passing normally.",
