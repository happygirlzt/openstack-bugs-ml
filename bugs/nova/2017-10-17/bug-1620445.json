But some of the events such as cmt, mblt ... requires specify kernel version support, that why I add PERF_EVENTS_CPU_FLAG_MAPPING to query host's cpu features.\n\nThat is to say, nova should first to test if that host support set a perf event before pass a xml element to libvirt domain, which depends on libvirt's API to expose host's cpu feature(on 2.0.0)\n\nI think I need to change the min version of libvirt of supporting perf event, will update patch later.\n\nEli.\n\n",
