Bug 924970\n    \n    Tests were seen to time-out on libvirt when raw images were\n    used, which was due to large disk images being copied around\n    inefficiently.  A system with standard disks was seen to take\n    an extra 60s/10G which was a problem with large root and\n    ephemeral disks.  The changes below attempt to minimize the\n    I/O in dealing with cached raw images.  These changes should\n    also help to minimize the disk space used for such images,\n    by avoiding the na\u00efve copy which undoes the sparseness.\n    \n    * nova/virt/libvirt/connection.py (_cache_image): Do the\n    resize here, rather than in _fetch_image(), so that we\n    can control when the resizing is done, to minimize the\n    amount of data that needs to be copied.  Also if we're\n    generating rather than fetching the image, then just\n    generate in the instance dir too, as this should be faster.\n    * nova/tests/fake_libvirt_utils.py: Remove the resize\n    functionality since it's no longer used.\n    * nova/tests/test_libvirt.py: Likewise.\n    * nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py (fetch_image): Likewise.\n    (copy_image): Shell out to cp since it deals better\n    with sparse files.  Note the above changes avoid sparse\n    copies, so this is just an ancillary improvement in the area.\n    \n    Change-Id: I678d125c61aab56c62c668559eb2220d56702952\n",
