That said, AFACIS I'm not sure any of this is lockfile related as nova.utils.GreenLockFile overrides lockfile's naming scheme for sentinel files, anyway, and the sentinel regexp is dependent on that, not lockfile.\n\nDid a quick test locally, and found that system named 'warhead.home.base' leaves a sentinel file as 'warhead.home.base-2ae619-2a025a0.24791', for which your newer regexp works, and the original does not:\n\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport re\n\nhostname = 'warhead.home.base'\nfile=\"warhead.home.base-2ae619-2a025a0.24791\"\norig_sentinel_re = hostname + r'\\..*-(\\d+$)'\nnew_sentinel_re = hostname + r'-.*\\.(\\d+$)'\nprint re.match(orig_sentinel_re, file)\nprint re.match(new_sentinel_re, file)\n\noutput:\nNone\n<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x7f69e74ad558>\n ",

This cleanup code doesn't work on windows I think,\nas it's assuming file rather than directory locks.\nMaybe os.link is available on windows but I don't think\nit's available in python yet.",
