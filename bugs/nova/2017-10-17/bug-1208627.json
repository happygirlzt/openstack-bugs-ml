However there were a couple of issues\n    with this change. There was no check that the availability_zone was\n    in the metadata grabbed from the database which would raise a\n    KeyError back to the api. Additionally, the check wouldn't always\n    work as expected because the database returned a set of availability\n    zones (including sometimes an empty set) so the check would fail in\n    some conditions when it was expected to pass.\n    \n    This commit fixes the logic for checking if the host is already in an\n    availability zone. It also replaces the try/except block in the\n    aggregates extension to check up front if the action is valid instead\n    of waiting for a key error when it goes to use the action.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1208627\n    Fixes bug 1208628\n    \n    Change-Id: I81b79602e23e78c8b077d313e556796de1255bbf\n",
