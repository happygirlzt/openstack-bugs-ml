This causes\n    issues in environments where cinder-volume may have already mounted a\n    given NFS share.\n    \n    This change works around this behaviour change by using os.path.ismount\n    to confirm if the target is already a mountpoint and if a source is\n    provided also checking /proc/mounts to confirm that it is mounted at the\n    target location.\n    \n    [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1405238\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1656774\n    Change-Id: Id64cc77237bf770a9a75bbf666a54a604ace558c\n",
