A number of test iterations were carried out to catch any possible transient errors.\n\nPlease Note the list of installed packages at the top and bottom of the report.\n\nFor records of upstream test coverage of this update, please see the Jenkins links in the comments of the relevant  upstream code-review(s):\n\nTrunk review: https://review.openstack.org/8793\nStable review: https://review.openstack.org/8749\n\nAs per the provisional Micro Release Exception granted to this package by the Technical Board, we hope this contributes toward verification of this update.",
