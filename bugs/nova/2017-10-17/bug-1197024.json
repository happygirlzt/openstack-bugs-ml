(Might need to add another task_state to be set as soon as possible on the the compute manager).\n\nIn this case it should be possible to treat instances in this state as if they have failed to spawn and either put them into an ERROR state, or even better tidy-up and send back to the scheduler as if the spawn had failed.",
