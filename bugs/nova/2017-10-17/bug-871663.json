Right. That's *exactly* why I want it to use the one in\n/usr/local. /usr/local is where admins can install things that should\noverride what is provided by their OS vendor. Everything else will use\nthe ovs-* commands from /usr/local/sbin if they exist, while this\nscript will happily keep using the version that is installed in /usr.\n\n-- \nSoren Hansen \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| http://linux2go.dk/\nUbuntu Developer \u00a0 \u00a0| http://www.ubuntu.com/\nOpenStack Developer | http://www.openstack.org/\n",
