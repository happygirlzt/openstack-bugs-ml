Because of our fallback code to\n    the main cell DB we'll then call flavor_access_get_by_flavor_id\n    which returns an empty list and that's what goes into the\n    notification, but it's not accurate since the empty list implies\n    there are/were no projects with access to that flavor, when in\n    reality we don't know.\n    \n    This handles the delete notification case by orphaning the flavor\n    object so that when the notification emit happens, the\n    NotificationPayloadBase gets an OrphanedObjectError and just\n    sets projects to None, which is a better representation in the\n    notification payload that we don't have that data.\n    \n    The tests needed some work since they were not actually comparing\n    the payload to the flavor object before, they were comparing to\n    fields in the DB representation of the flavor, which doesn't\n    include the projects field as it's a joined column.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6868efab22cf9f1eb9006589a5b62618434c3ba3\n    Closes-Bug: #1687012\n",
