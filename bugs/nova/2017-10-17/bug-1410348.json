            "content": "History of the change.\n\nMy initial goal was to port oslo_concurrency to Python 3.\n\nI had issues with the mask_password() function of oslo_utils.strutils which wants to work on unicode. If the input type is bytes, mask_password() tries to decode the input from the default Python encoding (ex: ascii in Python 2, utf-8 on Python 3), but it keeps the input unchanged on UnicodeDecodeError. I proposed a change to be able to work on bytes, but it was rejected (or at least not accepted):\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/137600/\n\nI chose a different approach: have a reliable behaviour on Python 2 & Python 3, for any kind of output (ascii or non-ascii output): always work on Unicode.\n\nI don't understand the expectations of these functions (execute, ssh_execute). The output (stdout/stderr) should be considered as binary or text? I prefer to consider that it is text because on error was tried to replace a text pattern with a message to hide passwords.\n\nI'm working on a change which would restore the previous behaviour on Python 2, and keep the Python 3 compatibility. Hint: don't decode stdout/stderr on Python 2.",
