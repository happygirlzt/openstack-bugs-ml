The current version of the driver iterates over a list of every virtual machine in the entire vCenter inventory. This list is fetched on every VM operation.\n\nIn database terms this is the equivalent of doing \"select * from VirtualMachine\" and iterating over the whole result set until you find the one virtual machine you need. This is tremendously wasteful even if you only do it once per virtual machine in your inventory.\n",

When a VM is created the config spec will be updated\n    with the UUID of the VM - that is, the field 'instanceUuid' will be\n    set. The search is later done on this field.\n    \n    If the search fails then the old code will be invoked - this ensures\n    backward compatibility with running VM's. Thus all VM's created\n    without the 'instanceUuid' set will not be affected.\n    \n    In addition to optimizing the search we also cache the VM reference.\n    This ensures that additional calls for the specific VM do not need\n    to query the backend for the reference.\n    \n    Change-Id: I00d6c29f46b06d082cf3af0369a69147a3376341\n    Closes-bug: #1258179\n",
