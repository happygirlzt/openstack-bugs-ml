As is it is only partially complete in oslo-incubator\n    and it is getting synced into various projects (and breaking\n    some things).\n    \n    This commit drops securemessage.py which was missing classes in\n    the crypto module anyway and would not have worked.\n    \n    Closes-bug #1241634\n    \n    Change-Id: I050d620a51042007aa4696fa439bd99c7597a9a4\n",
