This causes an issue with the metadata diff detection at the cell level so new keys are not pushed to the virt driver.  This causes them to not be set in xenstore in the xenserver driver.",

So this change goes back to previous behaviour for\n    cells.\n    \n    Change-Id: I339da9d1ff6d0e59f6a4ab68fd396bdfca7a224b\n    Closes-bug: #1292181\n    Closes-bug: #1292185\n",
