But after that, we are still left with for spawn:\n\nspawn() gets node from Ironic\nspawn() updates node\nspawn() -> _add_driver_fields() updates node 'n' times where 'n' is # of required pxe fields\nspawn() makes a node validate call\nspawn() -> _plug_vifs() -> _unplug_vifs() lists ports.\nspawn() -> _plug_vifs() -> _unplug_vifs() makes 'n' calls to update ports where 'n' is number of ports.\nspawn() -> _plug_vifs() lists ports.\nspawn() -> _plug_vifs() makes 'n' calls to update ports where 'n' is number of ports.\nspawn() updates node to set 'active' provision state\n\nWe need to figure out a way to make batch calls for some of these, IMO.",

            "content": "At minimum I'd like to see p and P reduced to 1 each as well. That would still be 7 API calls which seems a little crazy just to tell Ironic to provision an instance. I don't know if all of these must hit the conductor before the API returns, but each API call has some set of latency associated with it, and having to wait on RPC to conductor in Ironic API contributes more to that. If 'p' and 'P' absolutely cannot be reduced (though I don't see why they couldn't be), there's at least another solution to possible latency by making these calls in greenthreads. That really doesn't completely address my concerns, though.\n\nA little background: We (Rackspace) have gotten bitten by this \"API call explosion\" issue before in other areas of OpenStack (in neutron plugins -- before it was called neutron), which is why I'd like to reduce this as much as possible. I see it becoming an issue and would rather fix this as early as we can.\n\nI understand the desire to have API calls that do single specific tasks and I agree. But I start arguing with myself when I want things to perform the best. I guess balance is key.\n",
