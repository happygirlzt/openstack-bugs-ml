    "description": "Nova Compute fails to start when there are multiple nova compute services  running on different VMs(nova compute VMs) and each Vm managing multiple cluster in a vCenter and instances are provisioned on them.\n\nExplanation:\n\nLets say, one nova compute vm(C1) is managing 5 clusters, and another(C2) managing 5 clusters. C1 manages n number of instances. Suppose in C2 compute service gets restarted, it fails to start.\n\nReason:\non the start up of the nova-compute,  it checks the instances reported by the driver are still associated with this host.  If they are  not, it destroys them.\nmethod _destroy_evacuated_instances calls the driver list_instances, which lists all the instances in the vCenter, though they are managed by different compute. Instead it should return only the vms which are managed by c1/c2.\n\nlog file attached.",
