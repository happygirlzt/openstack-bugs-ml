The patch enforces that the reported available stats\n    only include resources of hosts that are connected to the\n    VC.\n    \n    Note: A host can be connected to a VC, but have a disconnected\n    host state\n    \n    Change-Id: Iba9d80f894cc2b7471a7f9c87b7367fd93bacb48\n    Closes-Bug: 1257998\n",
