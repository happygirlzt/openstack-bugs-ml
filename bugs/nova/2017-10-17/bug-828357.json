So we can choose which\nfile system to use. So which file system should be used?\n\nos_type\n   'linux' => mkfs.ext3\n              mkfs.ext3 -L <volume-label>\n\n   'windows' => mkfs.vfat\n                do we want to use\n                -n <volume-name>\n                -i <volume-id>\n\n                or\n\n                mkfs.ntfs\n                do we want to use\n                --label STRING\n                --fast: perform a quick format\n\n   other os  => We don't know. (Solaris, BSD* ...)\n                leave it uninitialized or make it user configurable?\n\n> The other thing is that mkfs on a large volume will take quite a while,\n> so you'd most definitely want to consider that.

It reduces mkfs\ntime much.\n",
