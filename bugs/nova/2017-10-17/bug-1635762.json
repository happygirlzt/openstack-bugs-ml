    "description": "Errors or bugs might make instances run on a node, after they were already deleted or shelved by API. nova-compute now has a mechanism that allow users to cleanup running instances that were deleted, but not instances that were shelved or shelved-offloaded.\n\nThat can cause serious problems for the user - i.e. instance that if marked as shelved-offloaded, but actually is running, and is later started by the user, will cause the same instance to run twice in a cluster, and 2 instances can write to the same volume and cause data corruption.\n\nAn example use-case that happened to me:\nThe user has a shelved-offloaded instance. He has requested to unshelve the instance. nova-compute tries to spawn the instance in the hypervisor. The hypervisor is really busy and slow, and reports a timeout. nova-compute tries to clean the instance, but it didn't spawn yet, it will spawn in a few seconds, and the unshelving fails - the instance goes back to being shelved-offloaded.\nThe user then sees it, and re-tries the unshelving. The scheduler returns a different node, and the spawning is successful. We now have 2 instances of the same VM, on different nodes, writing to the same volume, and a data-corruption occurs.\n\nnova-compute already have a mechanism of cleanup of running-deleted instances, controlled by the running_deleted_instance_action configuration parameter. The solution is to make the same mechanism cleaning-up shelved and shelved-offloaded instances on the same loop.\n\nVersion - Mitaka\nHypervisor - libvirt",
