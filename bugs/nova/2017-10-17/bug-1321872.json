    "description": "I originally thought this was bug 1306342 but that's a different issue, that was when not having neutron configured properly for calling back to nova and nova would timeout on spawn waiting for a notification from neutron that networking was setup.\n\nThis is a different issue where resize/migrate fails if you started from a stopped instance and using neutron.  In this case, the _create_domain_and_network method in the libvirt driver passes in power_on=False since the instance was stopped before the resize/migration.  The virtual interface isn't plugged in that case so we're waiting on a neutron event that's not going to happen, and we hit the eventlet timeout which then tries to destroy the non-running domain, and that fails with a libvirtError telling you that the domain isn't running in the first place.\n\nThe fix is to check the power_on flag in _create_domain_and_network and if it's False, don't wait for neutron events, same as if vifs_already_plugged=False is passed in.",
