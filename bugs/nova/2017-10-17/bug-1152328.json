It's possible to see the instance ACTIVE but\n    access_ip_* will be blank.\n    \n    To fix this, we should set access_ip_* at the same time the instance goes\n    ACTIVE.  This also removes an unnecessary extra DB call.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1152328\n    \n    Change-Id: I0fe542d49fbc95f27a24f57f674264f8789bc527\n",
