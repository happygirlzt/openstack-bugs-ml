This is a known issues that was fixed in python-amqp 1.4.4.\n\n[Test Case]\n\nDeploy openstack using current Trusty versions + this version of python-amqp + rabbitmq configured to allow ssl connections only. Once up and running, check the following:\n\n\u00a0- number of rabbitmq connections - with single nova-compute, conductor etc I see approx 20 connections whereas previously i saw well over 100 and rising.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sudo rabbitmqctl list_connections\n\n- check that messages are being consumed from openstack queues\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sudo rabbitmqctl list_queues -p openstack consumers messages name\n\n- also check e.g. nova-compute and nova-conductor logs and verify that the erros menioned below no longer appear\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\nNone.\n\n[Other Info]\n\nNone.\n\n---- ---- ----- ----\n\nOn the latest update of the Ubuntu OpenStack packages, it was discovered that the nova-compute/nova-conductor (1:2014.1.4-0ubuntu2.1) packages encountered a bug with using SSL to connect to rabbitmq.\n\nWhen this problem occurs, the compute node cannot connect to the controller, and this message is constantly displayed:\n\nWARNING nova.conductor.api [req-4022395c-9501-47cf-bf8e-476e1cc58772 None None] Timed out waiting for nova-conductor. Is it running? Or did this service start before nova-conductor?\n\nInvestigation revealed that having rabbitmq configured with SSL was the root cause of this problem.  This seems to have been introduced with the current version of the nova packages.   Rabbitmq was not updated as part of this distribution update, but the messaging library (python-oslo.messaging 1.3.0-0ubuntu1.1) was updated.

So, question is what is it about that patch that causes these issues?",

            "content": "OK upon further investigation i have found some trace of a root cause. Oslo.messaging always uses a timeout of 1 second when polling queues and connections. This appears to be too small when using ssl and frequently results in SSLError/timeout which cause all threads to fail and reconnect and fail again repeatedly thus resulting in the number of connections rising fast and rpc not working, hence why compute and conductor are not able to communicate. I've played around with alternative timeout values and I get much better results even with a value of 2s instead of 1s. I'll propose an initial workaround patch shortly so we can get out of this bind for now but I think we'll ultimately need a more intelligent solution than what oslo.messaging support in this version.",
