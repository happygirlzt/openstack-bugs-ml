I debugged on Kristian's environment and captured relevant logs (of a whole slew of errors).  I'm not sure why ethtool is being used by libvirt, and I'm not sure why ethtool fails.\n\nI think we could peel the union if someone from nova team can tell us what ethtool requires of the host operating system in this case.",
