(it's only used to install the unit test binary requirements) This makes it difficult to figure out how to install nova from source in an environment since it's not clear what non-python dependencies there are. We should either add everything into bindep.txt (or a separate bindep file not used for unit testing) or document them in the devref (ideally both) to make it easy for users and packagers to know what needs to be installed to run nova. \n\nI also was not able to find any documentation on the binary package requirements for nova anywhere in the docs. The only place where I found the list of packages was the devstack code, but this is hardly discoverable when trying to install nova by hand. I feel like at a minimum we should document the requirements in the devref.",
