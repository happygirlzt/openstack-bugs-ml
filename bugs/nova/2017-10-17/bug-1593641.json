That was not being\n    converted to a primitive before being sent back over RPC.\n    \n    The jsonutils.to_primitive() method will simply return an\n    object that it does not know how to convert to a primitive.\n    As of change If9e8dd5cc2634168910d5f9f8d9302aeefa16097, however,\n    to_primitive() will now raise a ValueError. This was failing\n    in nova functional tests in I76a90a57070c5184e893a79406b5d1784fcc969f.\n    \n    We need to convert the NUMATopologyLimits to a primitive before\n    calling jsonutils.to_primitive() to avoid the ValueError. This\n    change explicitly only cares about this one known value and does\n    not attempt to do this generically for out of tree filters or\n    scheduler drivers.\n    \n    Change-Id: I01e4cc2ca9d193b64023bc7df04ef878e68d46b8\n    Closes-Bug: #1593641\n",
