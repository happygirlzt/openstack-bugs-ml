    "description": "I'm trying to use a single LDAP server for two regions with all of the LDAP traffic between the regions encrypted.\n\nI've setup LDAP with TLS/SSL on ServerA. I've added all of the necessary Users/Groups/System stuff for nova. I know it's working because I have an LDAP client that I connect to ServerA with the parameters:\n\nHostname: ServerA\nPort: 389\nEncryption method: Use StartTLS Extension\n\nWhen I login everything works fine.\n\nHowever, when I change my nova.conf flags like the following:\n\n--auth_driver=nova.auth.ldapdriver.LdapDriver\n--ldap_url=ldaps://ServerA:389\n--ldap_user_dn=cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com\n--ldap_password=secret\n\nand try to run \"nova-manage user admin admin-user\" I get the error,\n\nSERVER_DOWN: {'info': 'A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.', 'desc': \"Can't contact LDAP server\"}\n\nI know that ldaps does *not* work with TLS/SSL but it's the closest I could get to making nova use the StartTLS Extension. I looked through the flags in ldapdriver.py and didn't see anything for it or any reference to TLS or SSL. I do see that ldapobject.py in python-ldap does support it.\n\nI've attached a script to show how it works in python-ldap.",
