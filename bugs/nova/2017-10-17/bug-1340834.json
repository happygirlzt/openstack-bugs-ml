Recent security concerns around bind-mount have surfaced where a user could traverse to the top of a bind-mounted FS. (User namespaces mitigated this, but we'd like to be extra-safe)\n\n\nThe proposed implementation:\n\n* Adds a `fs` configdrive type, that just drops the config-drive information into a directory on the host, avoiding the creation of a blockdevice\n\n* Moves that config-drive directory into the root filesystem of the guest at spawn time.",
