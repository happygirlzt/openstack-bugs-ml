            "content": "I noticed the issue in code. I didn't need to test for it, so there are no logs. You can reproduce the issue by assigning multiple fixed IPs, and also using ipv6. Currently multiple fixed_ips has to be done by direct manipulation of the fixed_ips table. Once you have created multiple fixed IPs, use the console to make a call to xenapi/vmops._get_network_info(). You'll see that the \"ip6s\" field in the returned dict will contain the ip6 address repeated multiple times. You can also perform the test by enabling ipv6, and assigning no fixed_ips (again requires direct manipulation of the table, though i guess this could be done through a console as well). When no fixed_ips exist for an instance, there will be no \"ip6s\" in the dict returned by _get_network_info() even if you had expected there to be.\n\nI also just realized that inject_network_info() and reset_netowrk() can't be called from the os_api (or compute) because the parameters changed in xs_multi_nic. I fixed these issues.",
