One of the calls has either hung completely, or is taking a very long time to respond, causing the second API call to report this error message.\n\nHere we're seeing the error message in response to virDomainAttachDeviceFlags. Unfortunately we need to really see what\nthe original API call was which is hard to find out.\n\nWith some libvirt versions there have been bugs which caused this error message, so its important to know what libvirt version shows this error. Indeed if the gate runs on hosts with a variety of libvirt / qemu versions, it'd be useful to figure out if it only occurs on hosts with specific versions of libvirt/qemu.\n\nTo diagnose this further likely requires turning up the libvirt logging level.\n\nFor Nova I'd suggest setting\n\n  export LIBVIRT_LOG_FILTERS=\"1:libvirt\"\n  export LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS=1:file:/var/log/libvirt/nova-cpu.log\"\n\nbefore starting the nova-cpu processes. This captures client side traces\n\nIt might also be useful to enable logging on the libvirtd server side by editing /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.log and settings\n\n  log_filters=\"1:libvirt 1:qemu\"\n  log_outputs=\"1:file:/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log\"\n\nthis captures server side traces.",

The next API call virDomainCreate fails with the timed out error message. Other later calls have similar problems. From the logs I believe the problem is that a pending job is not getting ended.\n\nLooking in libvirt GIT history for changes related to job management I see this obvious strong candidate\n\ncommit 6948b725e78016e45b846a17b89fafb69965be51\nAuthor: Jiri Denemark <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Dec 14 09:57:07 2011 +0100\n\n    qemu: Fix race between async and query jobs\n\n    If an async job run on a domain will stop the domain at the end of the\n    job, a concurrently run query job can hang in qemu monitor and nothing\n    can be done with that domain from this point on. An attempt to start\n    such domain results in \"Timed out during operation: cannot acquire state\n    change lock\" error.\n\n    However, quite a few things have to happen at the right time... There\n    must be an async job running which stops a domain at the end. This race\n    was reported with dump --crash but other similar jobs, such as\n    (managed)save and migration, should be able to trigger this bug as well.\n    While this async job is processing its last monitor command, that is a\n    query-migrate to which qemu replies with status \"completed\", a new\n    libvirt API that results in a query job must arrive and stay waiting\n    until the query-migrate command finishes. Once query-migrate is done but\n    before the async job closes qemu monitor while stopping the domain, the\n    other thread needs to wake up and call qemuMonitorSend to send its\n    command to qemu. Before qemu gets a chance to respond to this command,\n    the async job needs to close the monitor. At this point, the query job\n    thread is waiting for a condition that no-one will ever signal so it\n    never finishes the job.\n\nThis describes precisely the scenario I see from the logs. It went into libvirt 0.9.9, which is of course just after the 0.9.8 version ubuntu ships\n\nUnfortunately there's nothing we can do in nova code to workaround this. It will just require ubuntu to patch  their ancient libvirt builds with this upstream fix, or for openstack to switch to newer libvirt builds.\n",
