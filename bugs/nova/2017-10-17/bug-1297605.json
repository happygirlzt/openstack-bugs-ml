This is what libvirt and I assume xenapi do, and unless there is a clear benefit to this (I see none) - I'd change this first - this would make the bug go away in itself.\n\n2) Raising a redefined exception is slightly better from the debugging perspective and I am sure admins will be thankfull for this patch, but form user point of view it's still bad (it fails, I have no idea why!) so if we are going to stick with this behavior for ISO - we should make sure it's prevented in the API then (we probably should not do this, but I am trying to illustrate a point here).\n\nThe real bug and the fix is imho here: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/89fd0770420200c58a20006eee3f3a03aa21fe37/nova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py#L496\n\n\"\"\"",
