Fixes bug 962117.\n    \n    1. Added validation for image metadata.\n    2. Renamed the method 'check_img_metadata_quota_limit' to\n    'check_img_metadata_quota_limit' since it also validates the image metadata.\n    3. Added unit test cases.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0e9dad97c03070363d14977897701e146870e41a\n",
