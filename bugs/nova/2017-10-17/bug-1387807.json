If timeout happens during initialize_connection, the volume state will be changed back to \"available\".  However, volume could be already mapped to the host on the array.  This leaves the database and array out of sync.  If rescan happens on the host after this, the volumes could show up as faulty devices when issuing the multipath command.\n\nThe timeout exception during attach volume should be handled and a rollback should be triggered by calling terminate_connection in Cinder.",
