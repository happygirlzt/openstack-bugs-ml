    "description": "Nova has a --limit flag that can be passed thru the python-novaclient. Currently, images/glance.py in Nova needs to pass this value in as 'page_size' so that it can be properly interpreted by python-glanceclient.\n\nRelevant pieces of code:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/python-glanceclient/blob/master/glanceclient/v1/shell.py#L81\nhttps://github.com/openstack/python-glanceclient/blob/master/glanceclient/v1/images.py#L175\nhttps://github.com/openstack/python-glanceclient/blob/master/glanceclient/v2/images.py#L49",

If a query does not specify a page size, this default value is used.\n\nNova has a --list param that can be passed with an image-list call, but it does not appear to be working, as glance client will sent 5 requests with limit 20 instead of 1 with 100 if 100 is specified as the limit.\n\nUpon further look, it appears there is an issue with variable naming. Glance client is expecting the attribute to be called \"page_size\", hence it is not parsing the \"limit\" attribute and is instead using the DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE value.",
