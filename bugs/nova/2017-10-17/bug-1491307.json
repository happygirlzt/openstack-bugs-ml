The  admin would think that his rule is applied and safe, whereas actually he needs to manually re-associate that group with 'one of the instances' for it to be applied across all VMs. More details can be seen in the public security bug 1492961 raised be me.\n\nI think it has to do something with the sec group rules not being refreshed in the code path... \"refresh_security_group_rules\" func not being called I suppose!\n\nI am new to OpenStack and would like to work on investigating and fixing this issue. I've assigned this to myself. Request reviewers to confirm and discuss the vulnerabilities and possible solutions.   ",

But the manager's function decorated with '@object_compat' calls decorated_function() \n  which calls _load_instance(kwargs['instance']). This fails since there is no 'instance' key there and once again calls _load_instance from the except catch...\n        except KeyError:\n            args = (_load_instance(args[0]),) + args[1:]\n\nFrom there it calls objects.Instance._from_db_object() with argument 'expected_attrs=metas' which is initialized to \nmetas = ['metadata', 'system_metadata']\n\nThe db instance dict doesn't have the keys in 'metas' because in trigger_rules_refresh() the sec groups are got from db by joining on the instances column, but it doesn't join on the metadata/system_metadata fields.\n\nThis again causes 'KeyError' because when db instance dict is converted to the Instance object, it expects fields that aren't in the dict. So the manager's function do not call refresh_instance_security_rules() on the LibvirtDriver and thereby IptablesFirewallDriver.\n\n\nThis same issue is mentioned in bug 1484738, although the end problems they cause differ. I've verified the fix proposed by Matt Riedemann and it resolves the issue. \n\nMore details: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1484738/comments/11\n\nWhy this is not repro'ed  in Liberty and why can't those changes be backported: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1484738/comments/13\n\nMore details in commit msg: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1484738/comments/17\n\nSo once the fix for bug 1484738 is merged to stable/kilo, it will resolve this issue as well.\n",

That failure doesn't get back to the user because the nova-network secgroup API does a cast to refresh the rules. So, yeah, the operation from the CLI would not return an error, but the rules aren't applied for the guest if you hit the KeyError, so you might have a false sense of security.",
