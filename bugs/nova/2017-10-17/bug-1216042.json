Builds\n    will fail if on disk VHD file usage is even slightly greater than the\n    root_gb partition allocation size to the VM.\n    \n    With VHDs, VM root disks usually come from two-file chains (one, if a\n    snapshot has never been taken or it was not a fast copy build). There is\n    a mild file format overhead involved and additionally, once a block has\n    been written to, the space is never freed or compressed from the VHD\n    file. The two VHD files in the chain may have overlapping blocks adding\n    to the total amount of overhead over the actual utilization. This can\n    result in a VM's partition internally not even being full, with the\n    external VHD File chain being even just a few MB larger than the allowed\n    size. Building from an image of such a VM will fail due to this check\n    expecting external/on-disk usage to never be greater than the internal\n    partion size granted.\n    \n    This patch adds a 10GB tolerance which should fix almost all cases of\n    build failures due to this bug.\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1216042\n    \n    Change-Id: I69f47351fe83e54775e0147a27450c21196f9bfd\n",
