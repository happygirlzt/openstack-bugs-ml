Since safeutils.getcallargs is modeled on\n    inspect.getcallargs which does require self to be passed in the wrong\n    interface was being provided.\n    \n    The initial user of getcallargs was therefore calling it incorrectly and\n    this usage was copied to other places.  However this led to strange\n    failures when someone attempted to call the method correctly.  So this\n    patch fixes callers of getcallargs, and removes some code from the\n    implementation that is not necessary once the usage is fixed.\n    \n    Change-Id: I86eb59a2280961b809c1b4680012fab9566d60db\n    Closes-Bug: 1524990\n",
