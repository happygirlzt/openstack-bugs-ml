    "description": "Currently the keystone middleware for nova is located in keystone (nova_auth_token).\n\nIt was put there due to the timing of keystone + nova during the diablo release.  The middleware should be moved to nova (as it is a keystone middleware to internal nova datastructure middleware). \n\nThis will be done with several changes:\n\n* add nova_auth_token into nova\n* update nova_auth_token in keystone to say that it is deprecated, use the version in nova\n* update devstack to use the nova version\n* remove nova_auth_token during E4",
