However, the\n    migration_get_in_progress_by_host_and_node method returns migrations\n    that have an \"error\" status, causing, among other things, the\n    Resource Tracker to continually log messages about how an\n    Instance is not resizing, creating excessive noise in the logs,\n    especially since the fact that a migration is entering the \"error\"\n    status is already logged.  This change causes \"error\"-status\n    migrations to not be included when retrieving \"in progress\"\n    migrations.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1258275\n    \n    Change-Id: I67bfec9f91f89ff38422469a5d86e14c4fffa40b\n",
