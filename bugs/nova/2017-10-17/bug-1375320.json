This is due to the fact that the network for\n    the VM in question are not sent in the first blob of data from the VC.\n    The VC will make use of a token indicating that there is additional\n    information.\n    \n    The VC indicates that it has multiple results.\n    \n    NOTE: Commit 1deb31f85a8f5d1e261b2cf1eddc537a5da7f60b removed the ESX\n    driver. The retrieval of networks only needs to be done for a cluster\n    and not a ESX host.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1375320\n    \n    Change-Id: I7299c38410dedd20e3778db3c4f1a63d92b4334c\n",
