In the case of Rackspace, it breaks backwards compatibility with our legacy cloud servers, which properly sets the FQDN if that's what the server name is. \n\nIf I set the server name to \"nova1.broadpool.net,\" then setting the server's hostname internally to \"nova1broadpoolnet\" does not make sense to me. That just means that I now have to manually go into each and every server and change the name to what was intended. ",
