The defined syntax for a scheduler option (in nova.conf) is <name>=<value>, <name>=<value> and the interface to parse_options is to split on sep (which defaults to '=').\n\nBy that logic everything is working exactly as defined.\n\nThe assertion is that parse_options should be defensive in the face of what amounts to typos, because it already is to some extent.\n\nI think there are two ways we could go here:\n\n* switch to making parse_options accept a class of characters for name and do an rpartition or rpslit (limited to one split) instead of partition. The let ValueError happen on either converter failing on value or name not being comprised of the character class (this is effectively the same as the right hand grammar suggestion described above).\n* stop filtering bad things at all, just split on sep and let the bad names bubble up: if we filter them people will never know to fix them.",
