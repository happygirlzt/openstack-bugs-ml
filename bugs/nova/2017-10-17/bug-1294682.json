    "description": "When spawning a new VM using cow images, the root image won't get the size of the flavor. Instead, it will have the size of the base image no resize is attempted. In this case, the proper size should be specified when creating the differencing image.\n\nIf after that one attempts to resize the VM, the get_internal_vhd_size_by_file_size method will raise an exception as it can't get this info out of the differencing image. Instead of raising this exception, this method may recurse by calling itself on the parent of the differencing image. This happens on both V1 and V2 namespaces. \n\nTrace: http://paste.openstack.org/show/73825/",
