    "description": "When using Nova scheduler with either the DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter we expose a way to make repeated DB calls via compute_api.get(). A user could submit requests to create servers with scheduler_hints such that thousands of DB calls to lookup an instance ID are made... which can cause the Nova scheduler to hang until the all the lookups are finished.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1) Create a valid instance.\n\n2) Obtain the 'ID' of the instance. You can do this by looking at the instance_name (an extended server attribute)\n\n3) Create specially formated server create request which repeates the valid instance ID in the os:scheduler_hints part of the request. See the following example request:\n\n{\n\"server\" : {\n\"name\" : \"sched_tester\",\n\"imageRef\" : \"7d3b6df9-0cb0-45ce-b9d8-621829d85554\",\n\"flavorRef\" : \"1\"\n},\n\"os:scheduler_hints\" : {\n  \"same_host\": [\"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\", \"1234\"...]\n}\n}\n\nIf you script it you can repeat the ID 10,000 times or so before you hit the request size limit for nova... plenty enough to cause Nova scheduler hangs for 5-10 minutes per server request (actual times would depend on DB performance, size, etc.)\n\nMaking 5-10 of these requests could take out all the Nova schedulers for a given cloud thus causing a server outage.\n\n-----\n\nAs a temporary workaround users can simply disable the DifferentHostFilter and/or SameHostFilter options in nova.conf. (these are not on by default so users would have had to enable them to begin with)\n\n-----\n\nA good solution to this might be to avoid repeated calls to compute_api.get and replace them with a single call to get all the instance host IDs for a particular user/tenant. This would however limit the selection capabilities to instances within the current user/tenants account. I think this is acceptable. We could also put a flat limit on the number of allowed instance_id/uuids used for the scheduler_hint requests.\n\n-----\n\nIt looks like this affects both Folsom and Essex.",
