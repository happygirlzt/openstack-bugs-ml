What we did in our deployment to fix it, is create a copy of /usr/share/spice-html5/spice_auto.html like e.g. /usr/share/spice-html5/spice_sec_auto.html and apply the change from \"ws://\" to \"wss://\" in that file.\n\nThen reference the new file in the nova.conf, like\n\n[spice]\nhtml5proxy_base_url = https://myspiceproxy.com:6082/spice_sec_auto.html\n\nSo IMHO this is not a bug for nova, but rather for the spice-html5 package to not provide an option to use the secure websocket scheme.",
