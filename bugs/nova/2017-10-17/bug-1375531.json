However, this update is not saved to the DB, such that any updates made within swap_volume are lost.  We need to save any changes made in _connect_volume to the DB, as it is done elsewhere in the code, e.g. _get_guest_storage_config https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L3488.",
