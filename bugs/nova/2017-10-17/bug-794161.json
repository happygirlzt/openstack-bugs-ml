    "description": "In bzr 1158 we changed the EC2 API so that it will only run an instances if the requested image has a property of 'image_state' == 'available'.\n\n'image_state' isn't a required image property and as such we shouldn't use it as the default check. We should use  the image 'status' property instead and probably only rely on the 'image_state' property if status isn't 'active'.\n\n---\n\nThis commit effectively breaks using the EC2 API with glance style images (which aren't required to have an 'image_state' property)",
