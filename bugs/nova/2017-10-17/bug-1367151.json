The patch\n    enables the VM hardware version to be set. By default the value will not be\n    set. That is, it will use the current supported version. If the admin wishes\n    a cluster to be comptable with a specific version then they should set the\n    value, for example with vmx-08 to be compatible with VM's created by 5.0\n    and 5.1.\n    \n    In the event that the cluster has mixed host version types then the VC will know\n    which host to place them on if the hardware version is set.\n    \n    The following link describes the versions - http://goo.gl/7lhmEm\n    \n    DocImpact:\n    The hardware version will be passed as part of the flavor extra_specs. This will\n    be with a key 'vmware:hw_version'\n    \n    Change-Id: I67f65feceab1eab6ec4e8f4934f1c8115ed1e812\n    Closes-bug: #1367151\n",
