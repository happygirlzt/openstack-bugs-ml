The new version of\n    tox causes that ordering to be different between tests\n    runs so tests must be resilient and test either the\n    content of the dicts or sets or their sorted output.\n    \n    Note: These fixes are only of those cases where a failure\n    was generated. If there are issues in skipped tests, this\n    patch has not found nor fixed them. The vast majority of\n    skipped tests are related to availability of functionality\n    so there's little that can be done about that with the\n    current testing setup. The best we can do is be on the\n    lookout for failures that could be related PYTHONHASHSEED\n    down the road and fix them as they happen.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1348818\n    Change-Id: I6b27ca2597c51b0656f441f325f9ffd0e31a606d\n",

This is\n    generally good for testing because it will help keep projects working\n    regardless of the hash seed, but horizon unittests don't currently pass\n    with a random hash seed so set it to the python default seed.\n    \n    This change will allow us to use new tox again and remove the\n    restriction on tox<=1.6.1 to run unittests.\n    \n    Also see Ib54364877a251db48c54dfdc43c503281ea1f04a.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8834487e8c7bcdbeae8397c1a10a18873976ce61\n    Partial-Bug: #1348818\n    (cherry picked from commit b30072e47ead3625cbf29a3b2955cae19a8e7533)\n",

This commit\n    removes much of the weight.\n    \n    The use of the sets in this method is also no longer necessary.  It\n    became clear that all of it boiled down to \"if the router is not\n    compatible with with this agent but it is known in router_info from\n    before then we need to remove it.\"  This is an exceptional condition\n    that shouldn't be handled in this method so I raise an exception and\n    handle it in process_router_update where other router removal is\n    handled.  Logging was added for this exceptional condition.\n    \n    The eventlet pool was also obsolete.  It was used to spawn two methods\n    and there was a waitall at the end.  The other refactoring made it\n    clear that the two spawns were mutually exclusive.  There was only one\n    thread spawned for any given invocation of the method and the eventlet\n    pool is overkill.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibeac591b08565d10b2a9730e25a54f2cd11fc2bc\n    Closes-Bug: #1378398\n\ncommit 4e8a5b7de71ba6f8c050c424613c025310498940\nAuthor: Mark McClain <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Oct 9 13:29:48 2014 +0000\n\n    Add Juno release milestone\n    \n    Change-Id: Iea584b00329d9474c14847db958f8743d4058525\n    Closes-Bug: #1378855\n\ncommit 93012915a3445a8ac8a0b30b702df30febbbb728\nAuthor: Mark McClain <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 8 18:49:20 2014 +0000\n\n    Add database relationship between router and ports\n    \n    Add an explicit schema relationship between a router and its ports.

In case the chosen port isn't on the\n    integration bridge the ovs agent is managing, an error is returned to\n    the calling function. This is faulty since one of the other ports may\n    belong to the correct bridge and it should be chosen instead.\n    \n    This is interesting for future L3 HA integration tests, where 2\n    different instances of l3 agents are needed to run on the same machine.\n    In this case, both agents will register ports which have the same\n    iface_id property, but obviously only one of the ports is relevant for\n    each agent.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1370914\n    Related-bug: #1374947\n    Change-Id: I05d70417e0f78ae51a9ce377fc93a3f12046b313\n\ncommit 623aa30b33692f8b1d1d12859281d23163829835\nAuthor: Kevin Benton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Oct 2 01:16:46 2014 -0700\n\n    Fix setup of Neutron core plugin in VPNaaS UT\n    \n    One of the VPNaaS unit test setup routines creates\n    and extension manager but passes it a class but it\n    should be passing an instance of that class.\n    \n    Change-Id: I589cdda0674fdf8fa20d92c2609e1ba6966125d8\n\ncommit 205162f58050fcb94db53cd51b674d2093dfe700\nAuthor: Mark McClain <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Sep 24 04:00:54 2014 +0000\n\n    remove openvswitch plugin\n    \n    This changeset removes the openvswitch plugin, but retains the agent for ML2\n    The database models were not removed since operators will need to migrate the\n    data.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8b519cb2bbebcbec2c78bb0ec9325716970736cf\n    Closes-Bug: 1323729\n\ncommit 20dbbab61c1159a3dc6ef838ec65b04f7e9cf560\nAuthor: Miguel Angel Ajo <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 1 15:16:19 2014 +0200\n\n    Fix pid file location to avoid I->J changes that break metadata\n    \n    Changes in commit 7f8ae630b87392193974dd9cb198c1165cdec93b moved\n    pid files handled by agent/linux/external_process.py from\n    $state_path/external/<uuid>.pid  to $state_path/external/<uuid>/pid\n    that breaks the neutron-ns-metadata-proxy respawn after upgrades\n    becase the l3 or dhcp agent can't find the old pid file so\n    they try to start a new neutron-ns-metadata-proxy which won't\n    succeed, because the old one is holding the port already.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1376128\n    Change-Id: Id166ec8e508aaab8eea35d89d010a5a0b7fdba1f\n\ncommit 239b2d94339574f63afe0c6df120bfea2974ef7f\nAuthor: Ed Bak <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Sep 29 14:15:52 2014 -0600\n\n    Don't fail when trying to unbind a router\n    \n    If a router is already unbound from an l3 agent, don't fail.

However, the community did\n    not want to add this library to global requirements, as there was\n    a similar httpretty library available (albeit with some short-\n    comings). As a result, the test module was renamed with a \"no\"\n    prefix, to prevent inclusion in automated tests.\n    \n    Since then, a new library, requests-mock, has been added to global\n    requirements, to replace httpretty, and is being used on several\n    other projects.\n    \n    This commit reworks the unit test to use requests-mock, instead of\n    httmock. The functionality is the same, but the mechanism (a\n    fixture with URI registration vs context manager) is different.\n    \n    This commit provides coverage for the REST client code, by using a\n    mock for the Cisco CSR VM. The unit test module can be subclassed,\n    and used with a real CSR VM, for 3rd party CI testing, in the\n    future.\n    \n    Change-Id: I55c8a253eb32985bc2016ae748b1ded58d021e1a\n    Closes-Bug: 1358470\n\ncommit 1d4e13574574472e299296892d7c9e8f706aea67\nAuthor: Chirag Shahani <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Sep 10 15:47:48 2014 -0700\n\n    Fix to delete user and group association in Nuage Plugin\n    \n    After a router delete operation, the attached zone to that\n    router is also deleted.

(Because the dict used to build the tuple\n    was ordered differently.)\n    \n    For this test, we can convert to lists and sort them to do the\n    comparison, since the ordering is not important.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1348818\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib7e5d59073e5e243450e28492d68942f6088bb5f\n",

The\n    problem is that set_members() is repeatedly called with the same\n    arguments over and over again because the list of security group IDs\n    contains duplicates. These duplicated calls are unnecessary because they\n    are idempotent.\n    \n    For instance, with a security group of 50 rules created in this manner:\n        neutron security-group-rule-create $SECGRP --remote_group_id $SECGRP\n            --protocol tcp --port_range_min $i --port_range_max $i\n    \n    Adding a server to that security group will cause 50 calls to\n    IpsetManager.set_members() because the list of security group IDs is 50 of\n    the same ID.

This greatly increased our probability\n    of multiple coroutines running transactions on the same table that\n    result in deadlocks.\n    \n    These deadlocks could result from many things including the following:\n    * a coroutine holding a pessimistic \"SELECT for UPDATE\" lock when\n      another tries to update the locked records\n    * two coroutines both issue update statements using a WHERE clause\n      invalidated by the other update (e.g. from a compare and swap approach)\n    * two coroutines insert records that, when combined, violate a unique\n      constraint on the table in a master-master Galera deployment\n    * any two workers using \"SELECT for UPDATE\" in a master-master Galera\n      deployment (write-set certification failure translates to deadlock)\n    \n    This problem is exacerbated by the switch to multiple API and RPC\n    workers, each of which can lead to most of the errors above even\n    without the switch to pymysql.\n    \n    This patch adds a deadlock retry decorator to the delete, create,\n    and update methods at the HTTP API layer. Additionally, it adds a\n    decorator to the update_port_status AMQP API in ML2 since it updates\n    the port table, which is a heavily locked table by ML2 making it a\n    prime candidate for deadlocks.\n    \n    Nova has had relied on the deadlock retry mechanism for quite some\n    time now. We were limping along by not using additional workers and\n    by relying on the unyielding nature of the MySQL C driver to\n    serialize everything.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1464612\n    Change-Id: I635cc49ca69f589f99ab145d4d51e511b24194d2\n\ncommit 95b6a74af10e2150b017647028de8454ef1cda2f\nAuthor: Aaron Rosen <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 16 17:23:09 2015 -0700\n\n    ovsdb: session.rpc never initialized\n    \n    Previously, if idl.Transaction.commit_block() returned a status of\n    TRY_AGAIN we would check self.api.idl._session.rpc.status which would\n    result in an attribute error as rpc is None.\n    \n    This patch fixes this attribute error by removing this unneeded check.

It uses lockutils.lock() which passes\n    do_log=True by default, which causes lockutils.lock() to do debug\n    logging about lock acquisition/release. IptablesManager itself also writes\n    debug log info about lock acquisition and release.\n    \n    This change will eliminate unnecessary duplicate logging in order to\n    reduce log noise about locking. This change is also related to\n    https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners/commit/f88f2fea7fe250b7d26cdcbc84633ccbbc68eeee\n    which reduces the logging level in the underlying lock implementation\n    used by oslo.concurrency.

neutron-server (multiprocess) and metadata agent\n    \n    All launchers implemented in common.service require each service to\n    implement reset method because it is called in case a process\n    receives a SIGHUP.\n    \n    This change adds the reset method to neutron.service.RpcWorker and\n    neutron.wsgi.WorkerService which are used to wrap rpc and api\n    workers correspondingly.\n    \n    Now neutron-server running in multiprocess mode (api_workers > 0 and\n    rpc_workers > 0) and metadata agent don't die on receiving SIGHUP and support\n    reloading policy_path and logging options in config.\n    \n    Note that reset is called only in case a service is running in daemon mode.\n    \n    Other changes made in the scope of this patch that need to be mentioned:\n    \n    * Don't empty self._servers list in RpcWorker's stop method\n    \n      When a service is restarted all services are gracefully shutdowned,\n      resetted and started again (see openstack.common.service code).\n      As graceful shutdown implies calling service.stop() and then\n      service.wait() we don't want to clean self._servers list because\n      it would be impossible to wait for them to stop processing\n      requests and cleaning up their resources.\n      Otherwise, this would lead to problems with rpc after starting\n      the rpc server again.\n    \n    * Create a duplicate socket each time WorkerService starts\n    \n      When api worker is stopped it kills the eventlet wsgi server\n      which internally closes the wsgi server socket object. This server\n      socket object becomes not usable which leads to \"Bad file\n      descriptor\" errors on service restart.\n    \n    Added functional and unit tests.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Partial-Bug: #1276694\n    Change-Id: I75b00946b7cae891c6eb192e853118e7d49e4a24\n\ncommit ea35b299f06050608f3e7bb6fbc880006ed31024\nAuthor: Kevin Benton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jun 3 18:25:14 2015 -0700\n\n    Allow update_port_status to take network param\n    \n    Allow the update_port_status function to take a network as\n    an optional parameter to skip calling get_network again if\n    the caller has already done so.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1463656\n    Change-Id: I994f3abdb1b0ad3b2766f409b206ad4a8b2309b6\n\ncommit d0be7bc57f573d5696108b571c731decfbde9f0b\nAuthor: Ihar Hrachyshka <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 9 12:46:54 2015 +0200\n\n    Make pep8 job succeed when /etc/neutron/neutron.conf is not installed\n    \n    Currently, if /etc/neutron/neutron.conf is not installed in the system,\n    neutron-db-manage fails in oslo.config code when trying to determine the\n    default configuration file to use.\n    \n    Test job should not rely on any contents inside /etc/.\n    \n    Instead, pass --config-file with test-only configuration explicitly into\n    the utility.\n    \n    neutron.conf.test was renamed into neutron.conf since for some reason\n    oslo.config does not support a name that does not have .conf at its\n    filename end.\n    \n    Change-Id: I719829fc83a7b20a49c338aaf1dbef916dcc768c\n\ncommit 826428dc8aeef124c2251624ae34fdc003e69ca4\nAuthor: YAMAMOTO Takashi <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 9 19:00:40 2015 +0900\n\n    Add a comment on _check_update_has_security_groups\n    \n    Despite of its name, _check_update_has_security_groups can\n    handle create requests as well.

This was the case\n    up to the Havana release as several plugins invoked the policy\n    engine directly to authorize requests.\n    \n    This was an incorrect behaviour and has now been fixed, meaning\n    that get_admin_roles is no longer need and can be safely removed.\n    This will result in a leaner and more reliable codebase. Indeed the\n    function being removed here was the cause of several bugs where the\n    policy engine was initialized too early in the server bootstrap\n    process.\n    While this patch removes the feature it does not remove the\n    load_admin_roles parameter from context.get_admin_context. Doing so\n    will break other projects such as neutron-lbaas. The parameter is\n    deprecated by this patch and an appropriate warning emitted.\n    \n    As a consequence neutron's will now no longer perform policy checks\n    when context.is_admin=True. This flag is instead set either when\n    a context is explicitly created for granting admin privileges, or\n    when Neutron is operating in noauth mode. In the latter case every\n    request is treated by neutron as an admin request, and get_admin_roles\n    is simply ensuring the appropriate roles get pushed into the context\n    so that the policy engine will grant admin rights to the request.\n    This behaviour is probably just a waste of resource; also it is not\n    adding anything from a security perspective.\n    \n    On the other hand not performing checks when context.is_admin is\n    True should not pose a security threat either in noauth mode or\n    with the keystone middleware. In the former case the software keeps\n    operating assuming admin rights for every requests, whereas in the\n    latter case the keystone middleware will always supply a context\n    with the appropriate roles, and there is no way for an attacker\n    to trick keystonemiddleware into generating a context for which\n    is_admin=True.\n    \n    Finally, this patch also does some non-trivial changes in test_l3.py\n    as some tests were mocking context.to_dict ignoring the is_admin flag.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1446021\n    \n    Change-Id: I8a5c02712a0b43f3e36a4f14620ebbd73fbfb03f\n\ncommit 89c0875178f22651109a85d3c522d80324368caf\nAuthor: Gal Sagie <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 8 14:27:47 2015 +0300\n\n    Add documentations for VXLAN Tunnels\n    \n    The VXLAN type driver is currently supported, this patch add\n    description and links for more information to the user.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idb221ca4cce1a3a27bebe5ae6fc1e6ab5d030836\n\ncommit e61865807c4c8ff959a7746fe3e17f1ae574c9d0\nAuthor: Kevin Benton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jun 3 19:03:29 2015 -0700\n\n    Defer segment lookup in NetworkContext object\n    \n    Avoid call to get network segments for network context objects until\n    a caller actually tries to lookup the segments.

To this aim, model_query_scope has been refactored as well.\n    As the model query function being introduced in this patch\n    cannot use model query hooks (and does not need to), the\n    method was re-implemented rather than bringing out of the\n    mixin as it has been done for model_query_scope.\n    \n    This change will allow for developing DB APIs without\n    having to use the

As the project has grown, it's become obvious we\n    need to subdivide responsibilites and merge rights across the\n    repository. The advanced services split [1] was one way in which we did\n    this, and it's proven effective. Plugin decomposition was another [2].\n    As a next step to evolve things, this changes the core reviewer\n    paradigm into a system of Lieutenants, all reporting to the PTL in the\n    project. The Lieutenants will be able to maintain their own core\n    review team. The idea of \"super cores\" will fade away. And we begin to\n    see the benefits of a layered, structured approach to managing\n    Neutron.\n    \n    This proposal makes an attempt to comment on existing core reviewers.\n    While the idea of existing core reviewers being labeled as \"supercores\"\n    has been floated, the reality is a bit more nuanced than that, and I've\n    taken steps to address that with this patch. It should be noted that like\n    all things in Neutron governance, the system is based on a mutual trust.\n    \n    [1] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/kilo/services-split.html\n    [2] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/kilo/core-vendor-decomposition.html\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia4060066a300e851172c0fd7a2910ce53a6c649e\n\ncommit 1e0d201f1d71ce48a096f69700e4097e460ee53a\nAuthor: Carl Baldwin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue May 26 20:33:56 2015 +0000\n\n    Isolate use of fixed_ips[0] to avoid confusion\n    \n    I was looking at the assumption around using fixed_ips[0] in a recent\n    patch [1].

When the hash type\n    is 'ip', a CIDR is completely enumerated into all of its\n    addresses so 10.100.0.0/16 results in ~65k entries. This\n    meant a single allowed_address_pairs entry could easily\n    exhaust an entire set.\n    \n    This patch changes the hash type to 'net', which is designed\n    to handle a CIDRs as a single entry.\n    \n    This patch also changes the names of the ipsets because\n    creating an ipset with different parameters will cause an\n    error and our ipset manager code isn't robust enough to handle\n    that at this time. There is another ongoing patch to fix\n    that but it won't be ready in time.[1]\n    \n    The related bug was closed by increasing the set limit, which\n    did alleviate the problem. However, this change would also\n    address the issue because the gate tests run an allowed address\n    pairs extension test with the CIDR mentioned above.\n    \n    1.
