This is a daft thing for Ubuntu to have done, and it has been reverted:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/684875\r\nhttp://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/xen/devel/192003\r\n\r\nDo we need workaround code in the meantime?  We could maybe autodetect the broken versions of Ubuntu, and fix up the problem.  An alternative would be for you to add a udev rule that symlinked xvdX to sdX when it was hotplugged.  That would work I think.\r\n\r\nI don't like the idea of unconditionally assuming that it's sdX if xvdX isn't there -- we'll destroy someone's root filesystem that way.\r\n",

I was completely unaware of this change in maverick. \nNevertheless, I still think udevsettle should be executed before trying to open the just-plugged device, in order to make sure the device is actually available and avoid errors due to race conditions. \nI will open a new bug report for this.",
