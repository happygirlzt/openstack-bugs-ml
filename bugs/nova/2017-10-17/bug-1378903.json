This\n    change extends the try/execpt window to catch these cases.\n    \n    Also added original connect which in part keeps us from lazy-loading\n    the connection and logging of exception information so we can\n    figure out later what happened.\n    \n    Change-Id: If643a7da9f602ab7bb5d255031a841c674fa6c6f\n    Fixes-bug: 1378903\n",
