Where I disagree is that we *should* fix this in nova-network. The assertion that we should allow 255 character DNS names in nova-network is all well and good except the *only* implementation for DHCP in nova-network is with dnsmasq and it has a 63 character limit. As such the code that generates the dnsmasq host file for nova-network should implement some type of semi-intelligent truncation strategy, its better then outright breaking.\n\nSince I'm going to be fixing this locally in our code base I'll upstream our work as well.",
