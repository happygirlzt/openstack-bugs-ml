This change\n    also aligns Nova with the current default DHCP lease time\n    in Neutron.\n    \n    DocImpact: This changes the default dhcp_lease_time from\n    120 seconds to 86400 seconds (24 hours).  If the Icehouse\n    or previous release behavior is desired, set the config\n    dhcp_lease_time to 120.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia666ff31f299c57d46605705e9ebea21630e0722\n    Closes-Bug: #1317654\n",
