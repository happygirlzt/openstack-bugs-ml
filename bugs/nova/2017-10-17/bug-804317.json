            "content": "Yes. Originally the networks are not configured on the network hosts. You can solve this in two ways:\n1) prior to booting the network hosts. Populate the host column in the networks table. Then the hosts will configure themselves as a part of their boot process.\n2) wait for the network host period task to pick up the networks. They run about twice a minute. In order to scale linearly each host will only pick up and configure 1 network (so they take turns basically). So if you have 3 networks and 1 host. It'll take 1.5 minutes or so. If you have as many hosts and networks, you're all set once the first period task kicks.",

If nova is already running we're basically setting up a race condition: someone running the preset-host command vs a network host picking up the network.\n\nI can see solving the problem in a different way. First we can optionally pass in a host to the network create function. Then, if we were to add a  column to network \"configured\" and have the network hosts refer to this column to determine if a network is configured. Network hosts could then:\n1) get list of networks where \"configured\" == false\n2) configure one of these networks where \"host\" == false. DB resulting in \"host\" being set to self.host and \"configured\" being set to true.\n3) configure any of these networks in which \"host\" == self.host. DB resulting in \"configured\" being set to true.\n\nThis way any unconfigured networks are still picked up in a pseudo random fashion, but can optionally be preset to a specific host if desired. I think this option represents the best of both worlds.",
