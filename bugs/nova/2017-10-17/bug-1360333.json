Note that this single-purpose decorator was covering\n    up our ability to drill down to the actual method implementation\n    for hash calculation in the TestObjectVersions test. This patch\n    also enhances the decorator to be transparent, and makes the\n    test able to drill down through multiple layers of decorators\n    to find the actual implementation.\n\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: Ie454bffba113d7b3a863e975b2fb0ee6fb1dd552",
