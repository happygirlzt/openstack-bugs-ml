            "content": "I believe the comments indicate that the cache is working as designed.  The cache saves the trust state of all of the hosts for the duration of scheduling a single VM.  However, as Bob reports, the attestation server can take a long time to respond.  I see delays around 10 seconds and I only have 2 hosts in my configuration.    If I start 10 VMs at the same time, this adds at least 100 seconds to scheduling time.  It would be a great performance boost if all VMs starting around the same time could share a cache.",

Which attestation server are you using?\nb) I think with the local cache, it will not take 100 seconds to start VM at the same time if they are started in batch.\nc) I agree that a global cache should help, I will comments on the patch.\n\n\nThanks\n--jyh",

The filter works on class names until it gets through to the 'get_filtered_objects' method which is called once for each VM to be scheduled since we have filter_properties there; as such each class is instantiated for each VM schedule.  We _always_ get a new cache because the cache is on ComputeAttestation which is initialised when TrustedFilter is initialised and there are no global singletons.\n\nSurely since the cache has a timeout it can very safely be global since we will never trust the cache contents once the timeout has been reached.",

This is both time consuming and unnecessary. In cases where\n    a filter/weigher tries to be smart and store/cache something in between\n    invocations this actually prohibits that.\n    \n    This change make base filter/weigher functions take objects instead of\n    classes and then let schedulers create objects only once and then reuse\n    them.\n    \n    This fixes a known bug in trusted_filter that tries to cache things.\n    \n    Related to blueprint scheduler-optimization\n    \n    Change-Id: I3174ab7968b51c43c0711033bac5d4bc30938b95\n    Closes-Bug: #1223450\n",
