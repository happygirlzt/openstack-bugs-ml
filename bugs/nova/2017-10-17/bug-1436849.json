    "description": "When instance.vm_state is SOFT_DELETED, if we send duplicate delete request there is an inconsistency in delete api.\nIf delete api is called with instance name, it returns an error message while calling it with instance id returns success response and sends duplicate delete call to the server.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Set reclaim_instance_interval parameter in nova.conf and restart nova-api and compute services.\n\n2. Create an instance.\n$ nova boot --flavor 42 --image 7c0b4737-f630-4adc-9907-4868d2571260 test\n\n3. Soft delete instance. \n$ nova delete test\n--Will soft delete the instance and update the vm_state to SOFT_DELETED\n\n4. Call delete instance again with instance name. \n$ nova delete test\nResponse: No server with a name or ID of 'test' exists.\nERROR (CommandError): Unable to delete the specified server(s).\n\n5. Call delete instance using instance id.\n$ nova delete dc4449fe-5229-4b55-ad49-4fc9a5d8367f\nResponse: Request to delete server dc4449fe-5229-4b55-ad49-4fc9a5d8367f has been accepted. (sends duplicate delete request)\n\nThis is because when we call delete using instance id it fetch instance which is already in SOFT_DELETED state but in case of\nusing instance name it does not fetch instances which are already in SOFT_DELETED state.\n\nIdeally it should return same response in both the cases (with instance name and id).\n\nNote: Same issue is with force-delete call when instance is in SOFT_DELETED state.",

            "content": "According to my understanding of this bug, it can't be fixed. Can we mark the bug as can't fix?\n\n'_get_servers' method in nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py needs to set filters deleted = true and soft_deleted = true if vm_state = 'soft-delete' inorder to get the soft_deleted instances from db https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py#L2123. But these filers should come from the request only, like in the case of 'nova list --status soft_deleted'. \nThis can be fixed may be something like 'nova delete <instance_name> deleted=true' but that is adding a new request parameter. Can we fix this way? Other than this I can't think of an alternate fix.\n\nAnyone please let me know if I am wrong.",
