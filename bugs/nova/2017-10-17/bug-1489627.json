    "description": "Three of the link manipulation methods in nova/api/openstack/common.py rejoin the URL parts by using os.path.join(). This is incorrect, as it is OS-dependent, and can result in invalid URLs under Windows. Generally the urlparse module would be the best choice, but since these URL fragments aren't created with urlparse.urlparse() or urlparse.urlsplit(), the equivalent reconstruction methods in that module won't work. It is simpler and cleaner to just use \"/\".join().\n\nAdditionally, there are no unit tests for these methods, so tests will have to be added first before we can fix the methods, so that we have some assurance that we are not breaking anything.",

This patch replaces the use of os.path.join() in\n    nova/api/openstack with common.url_join(), which uses the more correct\n    \"/\".join(), while preserving the behavior of removing duplicate slashes\n    inside the URL and adding a trailing slash with an empty final element.\n    It also adds some tests to ensure that the generate_href() method in\n    nova/api/openstack/compute/views/versions.py works after the refactoring\n    to use common.url_join()\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1489627\n    Change-Id: I32948dd1fcf0839b34e446d9e4b08f9c39d17c8f\n",
