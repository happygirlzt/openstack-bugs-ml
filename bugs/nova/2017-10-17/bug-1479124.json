However, the opt out required that the Host Manager run a DB\n    query for every host on every request, whether the information was\n    needed for the filters or not. This has turned out to be very\n    problematic for ironic, whose hosts can have hundreds or thousands of\n    instances.\n    \n    This patch provides a quick fix by overriding the _add_instance_info()\n    method to simply set the host_state.instances value to an empty dict. It\n    also overrides the _init_instance_info() method to a no-op, since that\n    will never be used in ironic.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Ed Leafe <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I18075fd2fd8f9f6d1d82e6cc487c9e15ebc2b1d5\n    Closes-Bug: #1479124\n",
