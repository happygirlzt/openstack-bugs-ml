It also now performs the unrescue through the compute api in\n    order to make sure the database is left in a consistent state.\n    \n    The poll_rescued_instances method is no longer necessary in the virt\n    driver interface and has been removed.  And also removed from the\n    different virt drivers, since it was just doing a 'pass' in each of\n    them.\n    \n    bug 1088625\n    bug 1088627\n    \n    Change-Id: I75f7dc188cc49e5f6e5c8a3cb256d1c42ff7d882\n",
