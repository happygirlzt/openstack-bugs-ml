    "description": "If you create a server group with an anti-affinity policy, it is only honored during the initial boot.  If you do a cold migrate, live migrate, or evacuate where the scheduler is picking the destination, it seems reasonable to expect that the scheduler will continue to honor that policy.  However, it does not.\n\nThe reason for this has to do with an implementation optimization in the scheduler.  It skips all of the group checking if the 'group' hint is not present.  Since scheduler hints are only kept around for the initial boot, this doesn't work.  One solution would be to persist scheduler hints.  However, a shorter term fix specifically for server groups is to always check the database for group membership when the server group filters are enabled.",

The majority of the method was inside\n    of a conditional.  This primarily reverses that and reduces the\n    nesting depth used.  There should be no functional changes at all in\n    this patch.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iab4d63200653a4320c91dc1356091ff9d961cafd\n    Related-bug: #1379451\n",

However,\n    that hint is only present on initial boot.  It is not present when the\n    scheduler is being used to pick a destination for a migration or\n    evactuate.\n    \n    The updated logic checks the database to see if the instance is a\n    member of a group.  For performance reasons, it only does this is\n    server group functionality is enabled in the scheduler (group filters\n    are enabled).\n    \n    This change makes it so server group policy enforcement will still\n    occur for migrations and evactuations, instead of only on first boot.\n    \n    It also adds the call to setup_instance_group in evacuate, resize,\n    cold migrate and live migrate methods because now it is possible to\n    access the group setup.\n    \n    Implements blueprint anti-affinity-on-migration\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1379451\n    \n    Change-Id: I6e9ea6ba69e8658fa5126a3488ee12cf2437460c\n",
