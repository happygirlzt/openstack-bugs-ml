Otherwise, we get this error message:\n\n\nWARNING nova.virt.libvirt_conn [-] instance instance-00000019: ignoring error injecting data into image 2 (nbd device /dev/nbd12 did not show up)\n\nI think we should (1) make that message reference the fact that nbd should be loaded and/or (2) check that nbd is loaded and/or (3) automatically load it.",
