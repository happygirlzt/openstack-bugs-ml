That is, for example, there are 2 rows in the DB, the first call get the record from the 1st row and lock, at the same time, an another call get the record from the 2nd row and lock, then both calls will wait for the other call to release the row and will cause the deadlock scenario.\n\nSimply add order_by(id) to the query can avoid the deadlock by calls that are not order preserved.",

This might cause deadlock in large-scale\n    deployment: different calls may lock rows in different\n    order, and deadlock will happen.\n    \n    This patch adds order_by to the query and make the query\n    to the table order preserved.\n    \n    Change-Id: I98f6d7c3141349326c43cb32adcc1e6485ad53a6\n    Closes-bug: #1485408\n",
