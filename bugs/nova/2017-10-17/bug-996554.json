We are using an admin *tenant* to issue an image creation on an instance owned by another tenant.  The resulting image is owned by the admin tenant rather than the instance owner's tenant.  Our desired functionality would be to have the resulting image be owned by the instance's tenant rather than the admin tenant.\n\nDoes that make a little more sense?\n\n",
