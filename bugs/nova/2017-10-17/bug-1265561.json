Printing just the value is sometimes not very\n    helpful to identify the problem. eg., in case of KeyError, only the 'key_name'\n    would be printed as part of the log message.\n    This commit includes the exception type along with value while logging an\n    unhandled exception.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf00173a07510b2ec0c81a29624004f17810a4e4\n    Closes-Bug: #1265561\n",
