            "content": "I'm leaning toward thinking this a nova bug as I learned more about how resize is supposed to work.\r\n\r\nFrom this user documentation [0], it says the user issues the resize command to resize the instance up or down, if that was successful, the instance gets state VERIFY_RESIZE and the user is supposed to confirm or revert the resize to get the state to ACTIVE or ERROR. It seems like there should be another state like FAILED_RESIZE or something that indicates to the user that something went wrong. Setting state to ERROR would be too generic I think in this case, as it would imply, at least to me, that the instance is totally broken. Right now a failed resize will show status ACTIVE. I think if you know all the states and their transitions, that's a fine status, but if you don't, it's misleading and gives the idea that the resize worked when it didn't.\r\n\r\n[0] http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/nova_cli_resize.html",
