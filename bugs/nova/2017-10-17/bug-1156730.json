But missed one code\n    path where the service_catalog could potentially be set to None. So\n    this change switches back the default value of service_catalog in\n    the arguments to None and makes sure we tolerate anyone else\n    passing in a None or Empty list as service_catalog\n    \n    Fix for LP# 1156730\n    \n    Change-Id: I480b761d57c4699ea7ef72114160cdbeb281e454\n",
