    "description": "There are two issues to potentially address:\n\n1) _get_bdm_image_metadata currently returns a subset of metadata depending on which block device mapping is being examined.  For instance if the block is an image then return the properties metadata.  if the bdm is a volume, then we return the volume_image_metadata.  These should either be refactored out or the name should change somehow.\n2) The semantics are different between two types.  An image will return an empty dictionary if no properties exist (which makes sense because customers could have not metadata defined).  The volume will fail with an exception if no volume_image_metadata exists.  This should be addressed in some fashion.",
