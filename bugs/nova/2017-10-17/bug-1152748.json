The only way it could meet all the requirements while remaining a callback is if the os.path.exists() check were removed from the function, which would then require path checks in each of the backend classes where prepare_template() is called.

            "content": "Ok, finally I have found time to perform the mentioned refactoring, but I have a few questions. Rafi, as a bug reporter could you please clarify a few details:\n1. From the bug description I cannot figure out should call_if_not_exists() be completely removed or just the \"os.path.exists()\" check should be removed from it (but leave and possibly rename call_if_not_exists())? If it should be removed, what about synchronization (there is a @utils.synchronized decorator)?\n2. The other question is about unit tests. There are a few test cases (e.g. nova.tests.virt.libvirt.test_imagebackend.LvmTestCase.test_cache_template_exists, nova.tests.virt.libvirt.test_imagebackend.Qcow2TestCase.test_cache, ...) that expect that exists() should be called. They should be updated, as the client should perform the check now, right? Or am I misunderstanding something?\n\n\nNote. I have attached a patch with the changes I have already made, so you could look through them if you have questions. I could put them on review, but I want to update the tests (or implementation) first.\n\nOne more note. I'm quite new to OpenStack development, so I'd very appreciate your help even if the questions look stupid. Thanks.",
