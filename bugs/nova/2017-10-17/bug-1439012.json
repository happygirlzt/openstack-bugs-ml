    "description": "If a compute node's image cache is full, booting an instance of an instance not in the cache will fail, with a \"no valid host\" error, since the image of the new instance can't be copied into the cache. This occurs even if there are no instances running on the compute node. The only recourse for the user is to either wait for the periodic cleanup of the cache or have an admin manually clean up the cache.\n\nThe fix would be to remove unused images from the cache older than remove_unused_original_minimum_age_seconds immediately if a new image needs to be copied to the cache.",

            "content": "So, I don't think this cleanup can be prompted by the boot request -- the boot request never made it back to the hypervisor, as the hypervisor has reported that its out of disk and been filtered out of the list of valid hosts.\n\nInstead, I think we're saying that nova-compute could tweak the frequency of the cleanup periodic task as the local disk starts to fill up. That would have strange side effects on hypervisor nodes running with shared storage though (as the shared storage fills up, all of the hypervisors using that storage start running the cleanup loop more frequently, even if they have nothing to clean up). This is also a change of \"user interface\" in that the periodic task frequency is set in a integer flag value at the moment.",
