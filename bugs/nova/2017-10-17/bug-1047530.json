Since we are\n    still supporting python 2.6, this patch removes the method call\n    completely so we don't have to worry about locality.\n    \n    The patch also moves acquiring the lock  inside the try, except to\n    make sure the tempdir is still cleaned even if there is some issue\n    with getting the lock.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1047530\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie3da18262e67de076b1e474c24edd2e4e5208646\n",
