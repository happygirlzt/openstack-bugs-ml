Because of this all the components that had to\n    verify a token against consoleauth component would fail to do so.\n    \n    This patch fixes the check_token method and extends the tests to cover\n    the new v2.0 class.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1244220\n    Change-Id: I4e5186943d28609083f723f4b43ab6f0ecbffd27\n",
