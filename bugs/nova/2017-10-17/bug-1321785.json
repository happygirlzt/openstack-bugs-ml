    "description": "See bug 1319943 and the related patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/93787/ for details, but right now the block_device_info dict passed around in the nova virt driver can contain a clear text password for the auth_password key.\n\nThat bug and patch are masking the password when logged in the immediate known locations, but this could continue to crop up so we should change the design such that the block_device_info dict doesn't contain the password but rather a key to a store that nova can retrieve the password for use.\n\nComment from Daniel Berrange in the patch above:\n\n\"Long term I think we need to figure out a way to remove the passwords from any data dicts we pass around. Ideally the block device info would merely contain something like a UUID to identify a password, which Nova could use to fetch the actual password from a secure password manager service at time of use. Thus we wouldn't have to worry about random objects/dicts containing actual passwords. Obviously this isn't something we can do now, but could you file an RFE to address this from a design POV, because masking passwords at time of logging call is not really a viable long term strategy IMHO.\"",

SensitiveStringField is a StringField, which\n    is what BlockDeviceMapping.connection_info was already using. The difference\n    is that a SensitiveStringField masks passwords in the 'stringify' method,\n    which is what's used when __repr__ is called on the object.\n    \n    Since BDM.connection_info can contain credentials, and the connection_info\n    dict gets passed around quite a bit in the compute manager and virt drivers,\n    it has from time to time gotten logged without first masking passwords.\n    \n    This makes the object handle masking the password so we don't have to do it\n    explicitly anymore.\n    \n    There is no version bump on the BlockDeviceMapping object since nothing has\n    functionally changed.\n    \n    Change-Id: I66a0b5f6834034e2fcbefc4510e3aa018edec310\n    Closes-Bug: #1321785\n",
