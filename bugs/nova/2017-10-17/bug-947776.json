Via an always-present middleware becoming a no-op by virture of another config flag being clear\n\nThere's potential there for user confusion, for example a user attempting to disable some middleware other than ratelimit by clearing an unsupported enable flag.\n\nBy contrast, the glance approach would be to define multiple pipelines in the paste config for every sensible/supported combination of filters, e.g.\n\n [pipeline:compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap noauth osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n [pipeline:ratelimt+compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap noauth ratelimit osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n [pipeline:deprecated+compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap auth osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n [pipeline:deprecated+ratelimt+compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap auth ratelimit osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n [pipeline:keystone+compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap authtoken keystonecontext osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n [pipeline:keystone+ratelimt+compute_v2]\n pipeline = faultwrap authtoken keystonecontext ratelimit osapi_compute_app_v2\n\n... etc., then the appropriate pipeline is selected explicitly via a single configuration variable in nova.conf, e.g.\n\n  paste_deploy.flavour =  keystone+ratelimt+compute_v2\n\nJust a thought ...",
