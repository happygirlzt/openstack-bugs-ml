That one will solve the problem of live migrate not working at all through Horizon, and it's anyway preferred to provide service host name. It won't however change the fact that we can't use hypervisor_hostname as a migration target argument. In the review of my patch, Yunhong pointed out that there isn't a unique constraint on hypervisor_hostname the way there is on service host name. But, in my patch I re-raise if more than one host is returned when I filter on hypervisor_hostname, so I think it should be okay i.e. it's better than nothing, at least we try.\n\n@Yunhong What do you think? I was thinking also instead of re-raising I could raise something like \"multiple targets found, use service host name.\"",

Unless I misunderstood, it seemed that the only objections to Patch Set 4 were regarding implementation details, not against the approach.

I am not sure if anyone is interested in being able to give FQDNs instead of hostnames as targets of LM.\n\nDespite above:\nThere was a small possibility that by changing rabbit host in nova.conf from IP to FQDN this would be fixed, but verified it, didn't work.\n\nI think that item is invalid, but someone has to agree with me.",
