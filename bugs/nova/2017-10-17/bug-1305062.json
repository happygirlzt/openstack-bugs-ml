This\n    patch adds support for PAUSED vm_state. Essentially a paused state is\n    identical to a running state except the stopped CPUs.\n    \n    Co-Author: \"Matthew Gilliard <email address hidden>\"\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1305062\n    Change-Id: Ib38eaf412cb51a9cbfc443c5ec15c5797265ddae\n",
