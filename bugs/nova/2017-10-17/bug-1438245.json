This check is not necessary as the image is not resized\n    afterwards.\n    \n    When there is no method available to access the image (no libguestfs\n    or nbd installed), the superfluous access causes delays in the spawn\n    procedure.\n    \n    With this fix, extend() returns if the resize should not be performed\n    according to the configuration before trying to access the image\n    in is_image_extendable().\n    \n    Change-Id: Icb2f58b005539fec18b49d629ecd568d1f897e51\n    Closes-bug: #1438245\n",
