I'm trying to find if we should change the document in order not to misguide the users. Another way would be to retry on DeadLock. I'm not sure if that would be needed here since the sync operation takes very less time.",

I believe the difference in what schema migrations are non-impacting is quite dramatic between the different versions (at least that was true with MySQL 5.5->5.6).\n\nSujitha, are you able to reproduce this?\n\nFrom the logs, it looks like this line is failing, build_request.create():\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/mitaka/nova/compute/api.py#L951\n\nAs a nasty workaround, we could add a deadlock retry decorator:\n@oslo_db_api.wrap_db_retry(max_retries=5, retry_on_deadlock=True)\nOn the DB method here:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/objects/build_request.py#L162\nBut of course, we shouldn't be hitting a deadlock in the first place!\n\nThere are a few changes to the build_request, like adding an index and changing nullable columns that may be causing issues in this cluster setup if they happen while we are adding a build request into the DB. It would be interesting to know which one was taking a long time:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/newton/nova/db/sqlalchemy/api_migrations/migrate_repo/versions/\n\n* 013_build_request_extended_attrs.py (index added)\n* 015_build_request_nullable_columns.py (drops a unique constraint)\n* 020_block_device_mappings_mediumtext.py (does alter table to make things medium text)\n* 021_build_requests_instance_mediumtext.py (as above)\n\nI would reach out to Andrew Gardener on our team to help with this DB issue.",

We do the odd table create, which may cause problems, by the looks of things.\n\nIt seems MariaDB doesn't support as much online DDL as MySQL 5.6 as described here:\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-create-index-overview.html\nAlthough even in that case we have some type changes that look like they would block a lot of online operations :(\n\nI think we need quite a deep look again at this problem.\n ",
