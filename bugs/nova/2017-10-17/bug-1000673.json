    "description": "Currently EC2 API in nova forces security group names to match '^[-a-zA-Z0-9_ ]+$' (https://code.launchpad.net/~davewalker/nova/validate_groupname_create_security_group/+merge/68197). However, Amazon and Eucalyptus allow far more symbols - here is an example for Amazon:\n\n$ euca-add-group 'f(sg)!@#$%^&*' -d 'test name'\nGROUP f(sg)!@#$%^&* test name\n\nAccording to Eucalyptus source, the security group name is not validated - all symbols are acceptable.\n\nThis nova behavior can break client libraries. For instance, jclouds usually creates groups like jclouds#spam-eggs.dbnode.1#eu-west-1. This library was finally patched on 2012-03-27 (https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/issues/330, https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/commit/49e475edcd6dbf706250c05c90210476d7e43900), but the same problem can occur for any client that was developed for Amazon or Eucalyptus and tries to interact with nova.\n\nNative Nova API (nova.api.openstack.contrib.security_groups) doesn't perform any validation. So, we can create a group like \"group/1\" (the name is send in JSON during creation) that should not cause problems since API calls expect IDs (not names) in URLs.\n\nI propose to allow using ASCII characters from 0x20 to 0x7E in security group names in Nova EC2 API - that includes spaces, letters, digits, and symbols like ! \" # $ % & ' ( ) * + and so on.",

It's more concerning that jcloud are _relying_ on a bug in the implementation is worrying.\n\nThat being said, I'm not upset that Openstack's implementation will match others, so crack on.\n\nThanks.",
