    "description": "The implementation of the rescue call differs wildly between at least libvirt and XenAPI (I didn't check the others). XenAPI uses a pristine copy of the original image from which the instance was created, while the libvirt driver uses a specific rescue image (defined by a flag on the compute node) regardless of which image the instance is based off of.\n\nWe need to fix this. There's no reason these drivers should be behaving so differently.",
