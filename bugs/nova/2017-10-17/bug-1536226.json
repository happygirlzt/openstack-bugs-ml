    "description": "python setup.py compile_catalog only compiles one <domain>.po file per language to a <domain>.mo file. By default <domain> is the project name, that is nova.po. This means all other nova-log-*.po files are never compiled. The only way to get setup.py compile the other files is calling it several times with different domains set, like for instance `python setup.py --domain nova-log-info` and so on. Since this is not usual, it can be assumed that the usual packages don't contain all the .mo files.",
