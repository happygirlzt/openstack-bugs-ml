    "description": "Nova's API logging (in nova.api.openstack.wsgi) has a few problems:\n\n1) It mixes in error information with what's traditionally thought of as \"access\" logging, making it hard to parse. It also puts a lot of english into the responses (e.g., \"returned with HTTP 200\").\n\n2) Requests are double-logged, once with the request method, once with the status code.\n\n3) Complete information isn't always logged. E.g., if any of the various returns are hit in _process_stack, the response status isn't logged.\n\n4) Other useful information isn't captured.\n\nI think we need to move the debug data to a separate log channel (e.g., \"nova.api.openstack.wsgi.error\"), normalise the access log format and capture, and add the following :\n\n\u00a0\u00a0- User-Agent request header (so we can start to understand what tools are using the API)\n\u00a0\u00a0- Request body size in bytes\n\u00a0\u00a0- Request Content-Type\n\u00a0\u00a0- Response body size in bytes\n\u00a0\u00a0- Response Content-Type\n\u00a0\u00a0- time to service request (for performance metrics)\n\nI'm willing to do this work.",
