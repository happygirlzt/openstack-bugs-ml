While this may be true for EC2, it is not safe to assume that Xen images don't contain partition tables. This should check something more directly related to the disk image. In fact, ideally it would leave it up to libguestfs to work it out, as libguestfs is very good at this.",

I'm going to move it to \"Opinion / Wishlist\", which is an easily-obtainable queue of older requests that have come on. \n\nIn case you want to work on that, consider writing a blueprints [1] and spec [2]. I'll recommend to read [3] if not yet done. The effort to implement the requested feature is then driven only by the blueprint (and spec).\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
