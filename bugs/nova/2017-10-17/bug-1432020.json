For example, a node going through cleaning (e.g. erasing disks), a node in MANAGEABLE state (either isn't ready for scheduling or specifically removed from the schedulable nodes pool by the operator to do tasks like hardware inspection), and others. \n\nReference for the new state machine: https://github.com/openstack/ironic-specs/blob/master/specs/kilo/new-ironic-state-machine.rst",

This imports the\n    new states that were added, and adjusts the resource tracker\n    accordingly.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1432020\n    Change-Id: I6e6abfb41c6896e0db826a444979c5a28a5463fb\n",
