    "description": "(s390 architecture/System z Series only) FC LUNs with LUN ID >255 are not recognized by neither Cinder nor Nova when trying to attach the volume.\nThe issue is that Fibre-Channel volumes need to be added using the unit_add command with a properly formatted LUN string.\nThe string is set correctly for LUNs <=0xff. But not for LUN IDs within the range 0xff and 0xffff.\nDue to this the volumes do not get properly added to the hypervisor configuration and the hypervisor does not find them.\n\nNote: The change for Liberty os-brick is ready. I would also like to patch it back to Kilo. Since os-brick has been integrated with Liberty, but was separate before, I need to release a patch for Nova, Cinder, and os-brick. Unfortunately there is no option on this page to nominate the patch for Kilo. Can somebody help? Thank you!",
