            "content": "IMO, the fix for this has to consider the following:\n\n1) When creating an aggregate, the Nova API has to return the uuid assigned to it in the response\n2) In the placement API, GET /resource_providers/{uuid}/aggregates returns the list of uuid's associated with the resource provider (http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/newton/implemented/generic-resource-pools.html#get-resource-providers-uuid-aggregates). As a consequence, at a minimum, when doing a GET /os-aggregates (Nova API), the response must include an uuid attribute for each aggregate listed. This will enable the user to translate the aggregates uuids in the placement API to the ids used by the aggregate operations (GET /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id}, PUT /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id}, DELETE /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id}) in the Nova API.\n\n- Ideally, the GET /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id}, PUT /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id} and DELETE /os-aggregates/{aggregate_id} in the Nova API will also accept uuids (i.e. GET /os-aggregates/{aggregate_uuid}, PUT /os-aggregates/{aggregate_uuid} and DELETE /os-aggregates/{aggregate_uuid}). But this is a nice to have, not essential, as long as Nova's GET /os-aggregates return the uuids\n",
