To achieve the goal we need to set os='lx' in glance image-property and created an Aggregate with os='lx' metadata and attached the target compute nodes to it. \n\nHowever  AggregateImagePropertiesIsolation filter also return all other host in which \"os\" as a key is not defined along with matching target host. like it also choose another compute node that attached to some Aggregate whose metadata node container \"os\" key, it may contain some other metadata like \"cpu=4\".\n\nSo as of now, to get desire result, we need to set os='lx' to the Aggregate that attached to the target compute node and need to add all other node to an Aggregate that must have the \"os\" as a key with some other values, like os='win'.\n\n>>https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/c9eb9530314d047f5013941ebcfd5ef0192a9dc3/nova/scheduler/filters/aggregate_image_properties_isolation.py#L63",
