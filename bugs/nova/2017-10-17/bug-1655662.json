Default OS server creation scenario is boot operator prepared images which contain necessary drivers. There is only one case when you really need \"ide\" bus. When you creating a new template image, and only until you confiure/setup Xen drivers. So \"ide\" usage is one boot per image. Even less because most of current Linux and *BSD have it by default, even cirros works fine as \"xen\" bus only guest. In other hand this a rare need of \"ide\" covered by metadata property. In current state user have to set it manually for all images by default. That looks weird.\n\n> The default BIOS on Xen will not be able to boot a guest that only have \"xen\" disks.\nWhat Xen version are we talking about? Mine does it fine. Could you please provide more info about your setup?",
