However, if there is not an instance associated with the node, the resource tracker will try to correct the driver and expose these resources. This may result in being scheduled to a node that is still cleaning up from a previous instance.",

Some\n    of these states are not associated with an instance, and the resource\n    tracker will notice that and \"correct\" the driver. This allows nodes\n    in CLEANING, etc. to be scheduled to.\n    \n    Fix this by only reporting resources consumed when an instance UUID\n    is associated with the node. This association happens before the deploy\n    starts, and is removed after Nova sees tear down as complete, so it\n    should be safe to only look at the instance UUID for this. For any\n    \"unavailable\" state, report that there are zero resources available,\n    never allowing the node to be scheduled to.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1462374\n    Change-Id: I48913f724a1bbe3711ea543a50b9ba096d5e95d7\n",
