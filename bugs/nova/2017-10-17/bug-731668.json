    "description": "One of my branches that will hopefully merge soon brings up the API as an in-process WSGI app for testing purposes.  However, I can't figure out how to shut it down cleanly (other than by exiting the process).  If we could shut it down, we could control its lifetime properly in tests.  Right now, we have to cache the WSGI app across tests, which is naughty.\n\nHere's the affected code:\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~justin-fathomdb/nova/justinsb-openstack-api-volumes/+merge/50868",
