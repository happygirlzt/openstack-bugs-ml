If you have that flavor set it's global to all compute driver backends when using neutron in nova. That's why I think the more generic description from the compute API reference is better.",

Fix this by keeping the\n    configuration guide (how to create, delete, modify flavors) in\n    'admin', while moving the reference-style parts into 'user'. We\n    cross-reference the two internally.\n    \n    Given that large chunks of this needed to be rewritten, we've taken the\n    opportunity to fix a poor description for the RXTX factor, closing a\n    longstanding bug in the process.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia57c93ef1e72ccf134ba6fc7fcb85ab228d68a47\n    Closes-Bug: #1688054\n",
