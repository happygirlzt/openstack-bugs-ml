Further more simple-tenant-usage is very much a proof of concept and not something to really be used for anything real.\n\nWhat would you like to use the actual usage information for? If I remember correctly there are plans in progress to support the model where nova tracks actual usage and uses it for scheduling (as an optional mode).\n\nOverall this is more of a feature and not a bug per se.",
