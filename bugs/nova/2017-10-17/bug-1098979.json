This provides benefits for unit testing,\n    since we can easily override the time functions to simulate time\n    differences without having to actually sleep and make the unit tests\n    run unnecessarily long.\n    \n    Resolves bug 1098979.\n    \n    Change-Id: I1e6a0a0b1622a3f8c37c42376f5261f5f2dbf6fe\n",
