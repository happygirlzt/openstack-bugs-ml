    "description": "Using master or Grizzly, there is currently no method for a Spice console request to automatically fallback to novnc.  This is important because otherwise there is no migration path if deployments decide to switch from novnc to Spice as their default.  \n\nThe reason is that the enabling of Spice cannot occur until the instance in question is destroyed, XML redefined enabling Spice, then restarted.  Thus, upon deployment, existing instances will only have VNC consoles enabled, where new instances will have VNC + Spice.  If the deployment preference is Spice, users and/or Horizon should simply be able to ask Nova for a Spice console and get back a novnc URL if Spice isn't ultimately available. \n\nWe can make this fallback from VNC to Spice a configuration option, since the behavior may not be desired in some cases.",

This patch raises a proper exception in this case, such\n    that clients (including Horizon) can either message the user or fall\n    back.\n    \n    Change-Id: If06e726e606f4a27c8ec4617400b728ce7112e3b\n",
