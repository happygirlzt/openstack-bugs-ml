The procedure creates a network backing that is only applicable to standard switch networks:\n        backing = \\\n\n          client_factory.create('ns0:VirtualEthernetCardNetworkBackingInfo')\n\n        backing.deviceName = network_name\n\nThe type of network needs to be detected before creating the vnic and it should be added appropriately.",
