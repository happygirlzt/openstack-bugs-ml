    "description": "We created a flavor with flavor id 1, then deleted the flavor and created a flavor with the same id.  OK, then I create a instance with flavor 1, instance's resource is ok, but nova show shows the deleted flavor name. \n\nwe can fix this by 3 ways: 1. reject create a flavor with flavor id which is same as one of deleted ones.  2. flavor show should not read deleted flavors.  3. actually, system meta has flavor name, so nova can return flavor name to client, and client use it directly.\n\nI am not sure which way will be accepted. Any one has idea on this?",
