Perhaps it broke since then?\n\nHm... maybe it is not broken.  I'll test it to be sure.  I was having some\nuser errors using it previously (primarily due to haveing to run it as\n./nova/contrib/nova.sh (rather than ./contrib/nova.sh which seemed more\nlogical).\n\nAnyway, i'll sort it out.  I do have a patch to improve its use of screen\nanyway.\n",
