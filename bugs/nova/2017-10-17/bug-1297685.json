Older\n    versions (prior to 0.7.2) of cloud-init trip over the spaces in the comment\n    and as a result of that the key injected into the root account is not disabled\n    by cloud-init. Yes, it's a cloud-init bug but it's also a regression in the\n    sense that older OpenStack installations (Essex and older) don't contain\n    spaces in Nova generated key comments and thus older cloud-init's are not\n    affected in these environments.\n    \n    This patch replaces the spaces with dashes, i.e., 'Generated-by-Nova'.\n    \n    Spaces were introduced by commit: 114109dbf4094ae6b6333d41c84bebf6f85c4e48\n    Ubuntu cloud images with cloud-init < 0.7.2: 10.04 LTS and 12.04 LTS\n    cloud-init bug report: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1220273\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1297685\n    Change-Id: I1761f61dfbba58be98351ae4a51884b03268cf09\n",
