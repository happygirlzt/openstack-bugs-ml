We are currently safe since upper constraints\n    cap it at 0.12.0, but we will want to raise those constraints\n    soon.\n    \n    This method isn't actually used in the Cinder code, but since it's\n    an ABC abstract method we must implement it in our ConfKeyMgr. This\n    just adds a basic skeleton so we don't blow up on missing the method.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie2b2aef40b4de36d011c7efa0ab5af5c9581a63d\n    Closes-bug: #1715451\n",
