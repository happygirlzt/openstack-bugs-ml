    "description": "Hi All,\n\nThere is no command in nova(or any other service) to delete specific resource.\nNova quota delete command takes only project Id and resets all the resources corresponding to the service.\n\nSuppose I have updated ram to 7777, vcpus to 10, cores to 5. Now after few days I want to reset ram and vcpus to default then i have to update ram and vcpus to default using nova quota update. If I do nova quota delete, there is no option to mention these resources(it takes only project_id).  It will delete/reset all the resources for that project.\n\nI feel If nova quota delete also provides option to mention which resource to delete(reset to default) then it would be better.\n\nThanks,\nAshish.",

Change requests are done via \"blueprints\" in Launchpad [1] and their design get reviewed in \"spec files\" in Gerrit [2]. The process is described in [3]. The current \"Liberty\" cycle has reached \"feature freeze\" [4], this means you can propose this change for the next \"Mitaka\" release and use [5] for that. Since I consider this not a bug, I close it and ask you do create a blueprint.\n\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova\n[2] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints\n[4] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Liberty_Release_Schedule#Feature_Freeze\n[5] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/tree/specs/mitaka-template.rst",
