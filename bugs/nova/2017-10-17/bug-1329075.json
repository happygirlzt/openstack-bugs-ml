In order to maintain backwards compatibility neutron\n    advertises both nvp-qos and qos-queue (since icehouse). This patch phases out\n    nvp-qos from nova so that it uses qos-queue so that in Kxxx we'll be able to\n    drop nvp-qos from neutron completely.\n    \n    In addition this patch moves qos-queue to a constant like the other extensions\n    and improves a doc string.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id43ea931c995865ddc3455abfb625d86dd93e78f\n    Closes-bug: 1329075\n",
