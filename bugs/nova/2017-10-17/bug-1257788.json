    "description": "As seen by the large-ops test nova-network has trouble booting 150 VMs concurrently. Part of the problem is that setting up the network for each instance is relatively expensive with many locks and root-wrapped calls. Both of which significantly hurt performance.  One possible fix would be to do more bulk network operations when possible, so instead of 100 separate calls to a root-wrapped tool call it once.",
