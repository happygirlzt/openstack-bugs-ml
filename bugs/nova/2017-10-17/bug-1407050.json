This stems\n    from the fact that a clone of the VM takes place. There are\n    a number of know issues with this:\n    1. resize selects an invalid datastore (bug 1407438)\n    2. resize may fail when a selected host does not have access\n       to the datastore that has the config driver file (bug\n       1407050)\n    3. resized instances are not marked as owned by OpenStack on the\n       VC (bug 1402784)\n    \n    In fact we could do the resize on the existing VM. This has the\n    following advantages:\n    1. it does not need an additional VM\n    2. it fixes the bugs that are mentioned above\n    3. It is now far simpler and more robust\n    4. It does not require convoluted instance naming and tracking\n    5. VM deletion is simple\n    6. enables better test covergae\n    \n    The patch makes use of the same VM for resizing.\n    \n    Methods no longer used have been removed. These methods were\n    specific to the old resize.\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Radoslav Gerganov <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibcb108c2e0f84a84c599d2e7762a11efc7659395\n    Closes-bug: #1407438\n    Closes-bug: #1407050\n    Closes-bug: #1402784\n",
