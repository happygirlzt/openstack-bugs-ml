    "description": "If a compute host's hostname changes because of broken DNS, the node update code will break the compute node record in the database. Instead of doing this, the virt drivers should determine the hostname at startup, use that hostname for the life of the running process, and log an error if it changes so that the administrator can see that something is wrong.",
