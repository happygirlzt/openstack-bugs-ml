This \ncovers \"boot\" and \"attach\". \nThe commit message from [2] didn't have the \"DocImpact\" tag, that's why \nI'd like to keep this bug as a reminder that the documentation should \nmake this more clear, e.g. [3].\n\n[1] \"[openstack-dev] [Nova] Device names supplied to the boot request\"; \n   http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2015-July/069607.html\n[2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/189632/10\n[3] CLI Reference; http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/novaclient_commands.html#novaclient_subcommand_volume-attach",
