The solution was rather to stop using IPv6 for that bridge automatically.\n\nThat doesn't mean that you can't use IPv6 IMHO, just that the bridge won't use it automatically. \n\nAnyway, the above bug report I provided to you seems the best for discussing about your problem, I'd like to put this one as Opinion as I'm not sure Nova can help here.",
