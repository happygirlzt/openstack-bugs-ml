This patch modifes\n    them to deserialize properly. It leaves the old deserialization\n    in place as well so anyone using the broken implementation\n    will continue to work.\n    \n    It also updates the api samples to use the new format. Note that\n    the proper fix required changing the alias for the scheduler hints\n    extension, since the alias is used for xml, so the samples had\n    to be moved.\n    \n    Finally it fixes an issue with deserialization, allowing it to\n    support multiple hints with the same name.\n    \n    Part of bug 1050997\n    \n    Change-Id: I9969582d65d44de25388f07b6d2013fb7d093fb2\n",
