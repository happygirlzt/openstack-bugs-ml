It also cleans up a lot of the\n    code which ends up creating the instance DB record.\n    \n    The biggest improvement in this patch is removing unnecessary joins in\n    security_groups DB calls.  This also reduces the number of DB calls\n    needed to create an instance DB record in general.\n    \n    Side effect of this patch is the default 'display_name' for an instance\n    when it (or hostname) is not specified is now 'Server <uuid>' vs\n    'Server <id>'.  Because of the use of 'id', it required creating the DB\n    record, then updating the record later after we new the 'id'.  This is\n    gone.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1017722\n    \n    Change-Id: I9b7d48644a7abe075545c2c11399351b6a37939c\n",
