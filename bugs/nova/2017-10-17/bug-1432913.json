    "description": "We recently added a new feature with the nova api allow a user to specify a rescue_image_ref and a password to the rescue mode action in nova.  When specifying an alternative image we're not currently utilizing the image vm_mode and image auto_disk_config flags and are using the current instance flags.  For example, if you are to specify an hvm image to rescue a pv vm, you'll end up with a pv vm built off a pv image if you even get that far, as auto_disk_config will traceback first depending on whether or not compute can resize the file system during rescue mode due to auto_disk_config being turned on.\n\nI have a potential fix for this issue and will be creating a code review.",
