My intention was only to assign fixed_ips on port update if the port was a deferred IP port to begin with (only if fixed_ips is not explicitly passed on port create and the network is a routed network and so IPAM could not be done on create). However, for this to work correctly, we might need this [1] change and possibly a small bug fix.\n\nI'll try to confirm this on Monday. I'll target this for rc-1 just to get it on the radar.\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/361455/",
