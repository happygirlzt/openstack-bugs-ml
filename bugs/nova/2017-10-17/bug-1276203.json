Several Nova methods which use that\n    decorator also have code for returning early (ie no-op)\n    if the interval is 0.  This is inconsistent for users, and\n    means there is timing-related code where it doesn't belong.\n    \n    This patch adds a warning when a user takes a value of 0\n    from config and uses it as an interval in a @periodic_task.\n    \n    Ideally all code will use Oslo's convention that 0 means\n    run at the default rate and a negative interval will mean\n    \"don't run\".  After this warning has been in place for a full\n    release cycle that can be the case.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia227f4c4e69ecf361ab02d1d17a3010303650104\n    DocImpact: Warns of upcoming change to behaviour when\n               *_interval is set to 0\n    Closes-Bug: #1272830\n    Partial-Bug: #1276203\n",

This patch changes the behaviour and removes the\n    warning.\n    \n    Oslo (which provides the @periodic_task decorator) uses spacing=0 to\n    mean \"run at the default interval of 60s\", but several nova methods used\n    spacing=0 to mean \"don't run\".  These methods now behave consistently\n    with the Oslo code.\n    \n    Due to an error in the original patch, some of the warnings refer to the\n    intended behaviour change as being in \"the K release\", and some to \"Juno\".\n    The warning about changing behaviour is first present in Juno, so this\n    patch should be merged in Kilo.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie5f2092a3b84e3674fe6a68ce511d2dc218bb625\n    Closes-bug: 1276203\n",
