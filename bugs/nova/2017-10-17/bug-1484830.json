This exception will be raised in nova-compute\n    node, so user needs to check log on compute node to tell why\n    he/she trigger a live-migration but the instance is still in running state.\n    Livirt driver will raise exception like this:\n    \n    Migration error: Cannot block migrate instance  with mapped volumes\n    \n    We can make this happen earlier when doing can-live-migration-source,\n    by doing this, user will get the exception in nova-api this will bring good\n    user experience, and besides if we raise this exception early , then nova\n    won't do pre-live-migration and _rollback_live_migration.\n    \n    Before this patch gets applied, no state changes on instance, and no errors\n    will return to user, the exception message can only be found in log of\n    nova-compute.\n    \n    After this patch gets applied, user will get MigrationPreCheckError in REST\n    api if requires live-migration with block migrate and mapped volumes.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1484830\n    Related-Bug: #1457291\n    Change-Id: I671c57ca61ff3a62a2ad8935d809ff47542b526c\n",
