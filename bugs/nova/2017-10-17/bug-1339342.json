So when I go to boot from this image, I get \"Operating System not found\" in the VM.  \n\nThis was my user error, so I then used the glance command line image-update to set those properties after the image was already created.  Then I tried another boot from this image.  I got the same result, \"Operating System not found\".\n\nHowever, if I set the properties for the image at image-create time, everything works.

It is time consuming for large images to re-create them with correct disk type.\nCurrently, we look for cached image file and if it exists we proceed without creating sparse image and continue using the flat image. I'm thinking we can address this by appending disk type in the cached image folder name. That way, a new folder and sparse image will be created.",

Though I was able to create new cache images based on disk type, the code for cache management required changes too.\n\nCurrently, vmware cache management looks at the list of used images and list of directories (which are named using image id) to mark images for deletion.  In order to make cache management work properly, we need to override _list_running_instances() method and append disk type to image_ref_str. \n\nGiven that, I'm not sure if it is right approach to handle user error (specifying wrong disk_type) reported in this bug.\nBut I think it would be nice to _prevent_ such user error by introspecting the image and throw error if the disk_type doesn't match.
