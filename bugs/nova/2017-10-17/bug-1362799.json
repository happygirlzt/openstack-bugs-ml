    "description": "Nova used to allow a hard reboot when an instance is already being soft rebooted. However, with commit cc0be157d005c5588fe5db779fc30fefbf22b44d, this is no longer allowed.\n\nThis is because two new task states were introduced, REBOOT_PENDING and REBOOT_STARTED (and corresponding values for hard reboots). A soft reboot now spends most of it's time in REBOOT_STARTED instead of REBOOTING.\n\nREBOOT_PENDING and REBOOT_STARTED were not added to the @check_instance_state decorator. As a result, an attempt to hard reboot an instance which is stuck trying to do a soft reboot will now fail with an InstanceInvalidState exception.\n\nThis provides a poor user experience since a reboot is often attempted for instances that aren't responsive. A soft reboot is not guaranteed to work even if the system is responsive. The soft reboot prevents a hard reboot from being performed.",

Previously, a hard reboot could be\n    performed when an instance was in soft reboot.\n    \n    This fixes the regression by allowing a hard reboot when the instance\n    is in one of the two new task states.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1362799\n    Change-Id: Id8aaf852b0cccb75a79794a8bf9eb94e21550b81\n",
