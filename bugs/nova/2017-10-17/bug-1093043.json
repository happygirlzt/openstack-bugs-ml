This option is used just like Nova's db_backend, in that it is loaded via utils.LazyPluggable, however I haven't been able to find a way to get utils.LazyPluggable to read from the \"baremetal\" option group.\n\nSee comments on this review:\n  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/18563/1/nova/virt/baremetal/db/api.py",
