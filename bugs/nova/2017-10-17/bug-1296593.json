If the function\n    being decorated does not accept the specified args, an exception will be\n    thrown during 'decoration', meaning import time usually.\n    \n    If however the function accepts variable number of arguments, the\n    decorator will be a no-op as it is not possible to guess what will be\n    passed at runtime. This is however good enough for Nova's compute\n    manager decorators that inspired this work, as they decorate methods\n    with well defined and even versioned arguments.\n    \n    Several decorators used in compute manager are now fortified with this\n    \"compile time\" check.\n    \n    Partial-bug:#1296593\n    Change-Id: I00ebcc8a092fa0894ba8764699093f59a46b8647\n",

Also it is being passed an\n    instance object now so instance_ref can be misleading.\n    \n    This patch also moves all the tests for the said method to use instance\n    objects instead of a dict, as this is what is happening in reality.\n    \n    Finally we secure the wrap_instance_fault decorator with a recently\n    introduced expects_func_args decorator so that we make sure this issue\n    does not go unnoticed in the future.\n    \n    Closes-bug:#1296593\n    Change-Id: I140bfec2a52bf659a725a7dbe78ba5c527ed26de\n",
