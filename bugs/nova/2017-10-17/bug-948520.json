We still need to add custom CommandFilters for a lot of commands, in particular those chown/chmod/dd running on compute/network nodes, if we want to efficiently prevent nova->root privilege escalation.\r\n\r\nnova-rootwrap just provides the framework allowing to do that (previously we used plain \"sudo\" which didn't allow any filtering at all), and provides node separation (so the user-facing nova-api can't run any command as root at all). So it's an incremental improvement compared to previous versions, but it's not perfect yet.\r\n\r\nThat was on my TODO for essex by I just didn't get to it. Will do in Folsom though, if nobody beats me to it.",
