Sorry for the confusing.\n\n\nHi Jay, Geoff,Zoltan\n\nAfter some debugging, here is my research result:\n1. The error happened on \" iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p 192.168.1.252:3260\"  to discovery target iqn  by \"Nova\"\n\n2. Before step 1,  storwize driver already create a \"Chap enabled\" host on storwize hardware.\n\n3. After the \"CHAP enabled\" host created on storwize,  \"iscsiadm  discovery\" will need CHAP auth property, orelse the discovery will be rejected.\nThe properties are: \ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod \ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.username  \ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.password \n\n4.I went through the nova and Cinder code, did not find these CHAP discovery-auth property setup, so I think that's the reason why we discovery failed.\nAnd I also set a breakpoint before nova iscsi discovery, and then update the auto properties, after that, success to discovery.\n\nIf I want to fix this bug, it will influence Nova and Cinder general code change. \n\nI would propose other drivers verify this case before I modified it. I am not sure whether other drivers have the same issue (iscsi multipath and chap both enabled)or just IBM storwize.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

Usually /etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf contains CHAP authentication properties for discovery command.\n\nIn my case, for example, it looks like:\n\n# To enable CHAP authentication for a discovery session to the target\n# set discovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod to CHAP. The default is None.\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod = CHAP\n\n# To set a discovery session CHAP username and password for the initiator\n# authentication by the target(s), uncomment the following lines:\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.username = sgotliv\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.password = 123456789123\n\nTechnically this is a Nova bug because Nova runs discovery command in case it configured to work with the multipath.\nCinder provides all necessary information. Now the question is how do you want to update these parameters on the fly?\n",

I think the code change maybe done for both Cinder, and Nova. Cinder does not report the \"Part 1\" properties to nova but just the information for  login \"Part 2\".    (Even usually discovery and login use the same value for user and password value,just different keys)\nexample:\n=====Not report by Cinder but needed by Nova======= Part 1\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.username\ndiscovery.sendtargets.auth.password\n=============================================\n\nCompared to :\n\n=====Cinder already report for login================Part 2\nnode.session.auth.authmethod\nnode.session.auth.username \nnode.session.auth.password\n=============================================\n\nFor me, there are two options.\nOption 1:\n Cinder report additional discovery properties(part 1) , Nova use these information to do discovery. {both nova and cinder need to change}\nOption 2:\nCinder no need change, but nova use \"login properties\" (part2)to discovery. But there is a risk that, even usually they are the same, but could be different.{only nova need to be change}\n\nPersonally, I prefer option 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
