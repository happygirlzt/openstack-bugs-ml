    "description": "This is a branch freeze exception request, asking to take the work that enables Glance support when using the XenAPI virtualization backend.\n\nBlueprint: bexar-xenapi-support-for-glance\n\nBenefit of the branch: At the moment, XenAPI only supports nova-objectstore for VM images.  Adding Glance is obviously a big step towards the architecture that we want, as nova-objectstore is already deprecated.  This will also help work on other blueprints, such as xs-snapshots, as those blueprints also depend upon glance support.\n\nRisk of regression: This branch only affects nova.virt.xenapi and its unit tests, apart from minor bugfixes to nova.images.glance and the addition of glance to the pip-requires file.  This makes the chance of regression for non-XenAPI users negligible.  For XenAPI users, the risk is obviously slightly higher, but since most of the changes are adding new code branches to support Glance, this risk is still reasonably low.",
