This, in turn, causes\n    the unicode in the README.rst for rfc3986 to trigger a UnicodeDecodeError\n    exception.\n    \n    jlvillal (John Villalovos) pointed out\n    I340c88ea7d098ca5943d60adc73f63a0af79a405 in IRC as the fix to this bug.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1460206\n    Change-Id: If05e3fe76450c06431413f63e46e154cf44fc1cf\n",
