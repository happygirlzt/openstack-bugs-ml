The actual check was removed in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/320752/4/nova/compute/api.py@3187 which was apparently a mistake since there is no corresponding check in the API code.\n\nThe thought behind removing the compute/api.py checks was that there should be a corresponding check in the API. There is a check to allow or disallow actions in the attach_interface extension, but there is no distinction between an attach and a detach. They all look like http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/attach_interfaces.py#n147. So we have inadvertently removed the ability to allow one and not the other.",

This allowed deployers to allow one and not\n    the other. The v2.1 API policy check did not have this split so both had\n    to be enabled/disabled.\n    \n    This patch adds additional checks to allow deployers more granular\n    control.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icf1f0dd12920a2c6126e52a548f3fa4636b431d6\n    Closes-Bug: 1610069\n",
