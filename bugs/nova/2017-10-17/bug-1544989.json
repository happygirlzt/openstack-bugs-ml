Nova has no generic credentials to do that to Keystone. It's unclear if there is a way to do this from a non admin user.\n\nMany other bugs are related to this fundamental issue for which there is no infrastructure. This includes updating quotas, adding access to flavors, etc. This will be a placeholder for all those bugs until there is some way to actually address this at the root.",
