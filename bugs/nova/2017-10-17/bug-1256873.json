If only  fix InstanceIsLocked(InstanceInvalidState) to InstanceIsLocked(Invalid), the error code 400 will be raise, i think we should keep pace with other actions(such v3 admin actions) and to return 409 error code.\n\n2. In my patch (https://review.openstack.org/60128), i add some tests so make it looks complicated :)\n\nWhat do you think about?",
