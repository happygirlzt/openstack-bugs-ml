For bash, dash and ksh, $0 contains the\nname of the command that is currently being executed. novarc is\n*sourced*, not execve'd. The fact that $0 works for zsh is a zshism.\n\nI'm ok with the change, I'm just saying. :)\n\n-- \nSoren Hansen \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0| http://linux2go.dk/\nUbuntu Developer \u00a0 \u00a0| http://www.ubuntu.com/\nOpenStack Developer | http://www.openstack.org/\n",
