    "description": "In stable/mitaka in resource_tracker.py the help text for the cpu_allocation_ratio config option reads in part:\n\n             'NOTE: This can be set per-compute, or if set to 0.0, the value '\n             'set on the scheduler node(s) will be used '\n             'and defaulted to 16.0'),\n\nHowever, there is no longer any value set on the scheduler node(s).  They use the per-compute-node value set in resource_tracker.py.\n\nInstead, if the value is 0.0 then ComputeNode._from_db_object() will convert the value to 16.0.  This ensures that the scheduler filters see a value of 16.0 by default.\n\nIn Newton the plan appears to be to change the default value to an explicit 16.0 (and presumably updating the help text) but that doesn't help the already-released Mitaka code.",
