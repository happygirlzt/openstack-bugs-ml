    "description": "When an instance is terminated, dnsmasq doesn't release the ip immediately.  Dnsmasq waits until it receives a release packet or until the lease time expires. Generally this means waiting until the lease expires (2m by default) before trying to use the same ip.  We can fix this by forcing dnsmasq to release the ip from its database using a contrib script that is shipped with dnsmasq.  This will allow us to immediately launch instances with the same ip.",
