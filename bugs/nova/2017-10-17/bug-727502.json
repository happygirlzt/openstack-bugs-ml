    "description": "We currently allow multiple snapshots attempts to occur concurrently for an instance. This is not good.\n\nMuch like we already provide concepts of instance and boot-locks, we should add a 'snapshot-lock' that allows only one snapshot to occur at a time for an instance.\n\nProposal:\n\n\nThis could be implemented as a new column on instance called 'is_snapshotting'. Having this as a column in the DB means that the OSAPI can quickly return whether this the case and fail the request accordingly.",
