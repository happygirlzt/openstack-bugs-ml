    "description": "https://review.openstack.org/105950 introduced (or, more precisely, removed from flake8's ignore list) H305 which enforces grouping if Python module imports by type: stdlib, third-party, or project-specific.  The problem is that some modules are third-party in Python 2.6, but became part of the stdlib in Python 2.7.\n\nFor example, under Python 2.6:\n\n./nova/cmd/manage.py:58:1: H305  imports not grouped correctly (argparse: third-party, os: stdlib)\n./nova/tests/test_utils.py:19:1: H305  imports not grouped correctly (hashlib: stdlib, importlib: third-party)\n./nova/tests/test_utils.py:20:1: H305  imports not grouped correctly (importlib: third-party, os: stdlib)\n\nargparse and importlib are not part of Python 2.6's stdlib (and therefor \"third-party\"), but were added to Python 2.7's stdlib.\n\nThis wasn't detect by the gate because, though Nova is tested against Python 2.6 by gate-nova-python26, the PEP 8 tests are executed with gate-nova-pep8, which appears to be using Python 2.7.\n\nMy proposed solution is to add \"# noqa\" to the aforementioned lines (yes, those appear to be the only three occurrences), though that not only makes them invisible to flake8 for Python 2.6, but unfortunately Python 2.7 too.\n\nI'll try to generate a patch in the next 24 hours unless someone beats me to it.",
