This is both an information leak, and useless bit of information for the user to figure out what's going on.\n\nlibvirt should use an internal exception instead.",

This structure is unnecessarily bloated\n    and prevents us from raising valid InstanceNotFound exceptions\n    containing Instance.uuid values. Fold the latter functions into the\n    former, shedding this excess weight and partially resolving the bug.\n    \n    Change-Id: I43d608a629b3dba204264f1db97fb35b205aee85\n    Closes-Bug: #1522454\n",
