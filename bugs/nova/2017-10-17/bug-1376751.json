After this I was still unable to list the hypervisors and got the error: \"ERROR (Forbidden): User does not have admin privileges (HTTP 403) (Request-ID: req-11ba9712-adff-42fa-b1f2-90532c4a77f1)\".\nAfter trying to modified the rule \"context_is_admin\" ( \"context_is_admin\":  \"role:admin or role:domain_admin\") listing the hypervisors worked.\nThe rule \"admin_api\" is not working as it should, maybe there is a hard-coded check on Nova code that only enforce a set of operations woth the rule \"context_is_admin\"",
