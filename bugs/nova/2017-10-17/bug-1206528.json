    "description": "The powervm driver doesn't support aggregate host resource pools (currently the xenapi driver is the only one that does).  The base compute driver class raises NotImplementedError on aggregate operations to the virt driver if the subclass doesn't pass on the method.  The libvirt driver passes on the unsupported aggregate operations, the powervm driver should do the same.\n\nThis was seen in the logs from some tempest runs against the powervm driver:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/42631/",

This patch simply\n    overrides the methods in the powervm driver and does a pass like in the\n    libvirt driver.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1206528\n    \n    Change-Id: Ieac227f321339a4069b015303b6e713ab9fad7b7\n",
