As exit code 0 is the default value\n    for the allowed exit codes the whole check_exit_codes argument is\n    omitted.\n    Furthermore this updates the (dis-)connect volume sync locks to be\n    Quobyte specific.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1679976\n    \n    Change-Id: I87b74535bd1a2045948a56d1648cd587146facb7\n",
