    "description": "When the sysinfo_serial config parameter for the libvirt driver is set to 'os', the defined behavior is:\n- return the value found in /etc/machine-id file or\n- return an error if the file is not present.\nThere is an additional scenario where the file is present but it is empty \n(https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova/+bug/1413293) in that case we want nova to behave as if the file was missed.\nAt the moment the missing file and an empty file return different exceptions:\n- IOError for a missing file\n- IndexError for an empty file\nBoth of these errors are too general and don't give a big help in debugging the issue.\n\nPlease note that we do not want to fix the issue about a missing/empty machine-id file, that is something related to a bad OS installation/configuration or a bad image, the proposed fix is just to keep nova behaves consistently and giving back to the user a more clear and precise error.",

Currently if the file is missing, Nova return an IOError\n    exception. If the file is present but empty, Nova will return an\n    IndexError exception.\n    \n    We want to have the same behaviour in both cases and return an error\n    with clearer and more useful information. This patch makes Nova return\n    a NovaException when the machine-id file is either missing or empty.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1475353\n    Change-Id: I2b163d6a42f66ab660c3728b1e29b4b64efbceba\n",
