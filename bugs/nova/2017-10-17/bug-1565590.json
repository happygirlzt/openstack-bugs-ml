    "description": "To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:\n1) Create s small instance\n2) Resize to a larger instance\n3) Create a snapshot image from the resized instance\n4) Create an instance from this snapshot image, selecting the smallest flavor based on the snapshot image\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 value\n\nThe expected result is that in step #4 the image\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 value can be used to select a minimum sized flavor for a new instance, leading to a successful instance creation.\n\nThe actual result is that the minimum sized flavor suggested by \u2018min_disk\u2019 is too small for the snapshot image, so instance creation fails with a 'VM too large for selected flavor' error here: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/xenapi/vm_utils.py#L901\n\nThis error is seen in a deployment using Xen hypervisors with Glance/Swift for image storage.\n\nFor more detailed information:\n\nWhen an instance is created information about it\u2019s image is placed into the instance\u2019s system metadata. One image property is specially treated however: min_disk. The instance\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 value is set based on the re-size flavor\u2019s \u2018root_gb\u2019 (see https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/utils.py#L1229). When a snapshot image is created from the instance, the instance\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 value is added to image\u2019s properties. This \u2018min_disk\u2019 setting can then be used as per step #4 above.\n\nWhen the instance is resized (typically to a larger flavor) the instance\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 is *not* updated with the new flavor\u2019s \u2018root_gb\u2019 (however the instance\u2019s \u2018root_gb\u2019 is updated from the flavor). Hence when a snapshot image is created from this instance, the resultant image\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 is also set to the pre-resized value. For resize ups then, this value is then too small for the virtual disk size the snapshot will consume when instances are created from it.\n\nA proposed fix for this issue then is to set the snapshot image\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 property in a similar way to the nova/utils.py call above:\n\n     min_disk = instance\u2019s min_disk\n     if flavor:\n         if instance\u2019s disk_format == \u2018vhd\u2019:\n             min_disk = resize flavor\u2019s root_gb\n         else:\n             min_disk = max(min_disk, resize flavor\u2019s root_gb)\n\nThe instance\u2019s \u2018min_disk\u2019 could stay set to the original image properties for historical purposes.",
