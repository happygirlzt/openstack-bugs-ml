The directory referred to by ca_path is the target directory for the CA files, whereas genvpn_sh_path and geninter_sh_path is location of the scripts that need to be run to create the target directories.\n\nThese are usually not the same place.  In a source checkout into /opt/stack/nova for example:\nCA path == /opt/stack/nova/CA\nscript location == /opt/stack/nova/nova/CA/genvpn.sh\n\nIn order for this to work, one would have to manually copy all of the files from nova/CA into the location specified in ca_directory. I think this change needs to be reverted.",
