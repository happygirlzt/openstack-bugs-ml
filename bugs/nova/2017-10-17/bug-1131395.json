When the instance\n    initiates its own shutdown, this determines whether or not\n    the instance hangs around in the Shutoff state or is\n    terminated by the system.\n    \n    In nova, this is handled by the shutdown_terminate boolean.\n    IISB = stop      => shutdown_terminate = False\n    IISB = terminate => shutdown_terminate = True\n    \n    sync_instance_power_state now invokes compute_api.delete if\n    shutdown_terminate = True and we detect the instance power state\n    has gone from Running to Shutdown.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1131395\n    Change-Id: I284ae7a84384f19131703c4ad44e0e5f5b03f5d4\n",
