The flavor is created but an error is displayed saying \"Unable to set flavor access for project.....\"\n\nThe error is thrown because Horizon creates the flavor and add the access after that. The problem is that once a private flavor is created, nova adds the current project within the flavor accesses so when Horizon tries to add the access, nova throws an \"Access already exist for this flavor\" exception",
