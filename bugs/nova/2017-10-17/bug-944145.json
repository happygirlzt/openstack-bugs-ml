    "description": "putting a host in maintenance mode means moving all the VMs from the host to another host (effectively this is a live migration that requires the VM's host to change from the source host to the destination host). \n\nBecause of the potential concurrent execution of compute/manager->_sync_power_states, it is possible that after the migration, the state of the VM becomes SHUTOFF.\n\nLooking at the implementation of _sync_power_states this problem can be solved by ensuring that the VM's host field is updated prior to the actual VM migration, and by reverting it to the old value if something goes wrong. \n\nCurrent code in virt/xenapi/host.py was updating the VM's host field after the VM was migrated (to save one DB call in case of failures); clearly this does cause the race condition and need to be fixed.",
