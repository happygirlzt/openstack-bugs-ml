IMHO, we need to support both live migration with/without target host when using VCDriver.\n\n1) For migration with target host, we may need to enhance nova api to support migrate vm to a specified node, so possibly the api live migration need to change the format of host to host:node.\n\n2) For live migration without target host, nova scheduler will help select target host, but before select host, it will put the host where the VM running (for vmware, host is vcenter host) to attempted_hosts, this might also not accurate, we may need compare both host and node and decide if they are same.\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py#L145\n\n3) The last one is we need implement check_can_live_migrate_destination() for vmware driver.\n\nI can help 1) and 2) if you agree with my proposal, please show your comments if any, hope this can be fixed soon as live migration is really an important feature for many customers. Thanks.\n",
