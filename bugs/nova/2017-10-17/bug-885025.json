The XML schema would normally be the answer but RelaxNG isn't as widely supported as XSD, and the schema looks like it is incorrect anyway.  :-(",

Instead,\n    of defines each schema to allow either a list of tags with only\n    name/id (as in the index listings), or a list of fully-defined\n    servers/images/flavors.  It is not permitted to mix and match.\n    \n    It also adds three kinds of unit tests for the API schemas:\n    \n    * A basic check to ensure that the schema files are valid RelaxNG;\n    * A check to ensure that the collected body of schema files does not\n      contain duplicate top-level tag definitions;\n    * Explicit test XML documents.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 885025\n    Change-Id: I542b420de34fd82bb2a2813f36637aef2c2d5c92\n",
