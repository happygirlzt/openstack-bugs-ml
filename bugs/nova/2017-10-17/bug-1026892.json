Here are the related commits:\n\n\ncommit 2c1524866acb9f9ac3f50dc7d33338cfb03fd08a\nAuthor: Stanislaw Pitucha <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Aug 2 13:51:07 2012 +0100\n\n    Improve external lock implementation\n    \n    Remove a number of limitations from the external locks.\n    - They can be nested now\n    - They do not need external cleanup in case of failures\n    - They do not rely on lockfile or greenlet internal implementation\n    \n    New implementation is based on fcntl locks and any crashing process\n    will drop the lock. It does not have to rely on any cleanup code or\n    handling exceptions. Because no cleanup is needed, a number of tests\n    have been removed.\n    This implementation is not portable outside of POSIX/BSD/SVR4 systems.\n    \n    Fcntl locks should work correctly with NFS mounts.\n    \n    Locks are cleaned up after the tests finish running via run_tests.sh,\n    even though it's not strictly needed.\n    \n    This change requires eventlet >= 0.9.17.\n    \n    bp improve-external-locking\n    \n    Change-Id: Idf5424c04645f25097733848a007b150145b0b27\n\n\ncommit 3f0ef8e28fd0ec5102a58be8d0013900194869fe\nAuthor: P\u00e1draig Brady <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Aug 7 01:51:58 2012 +0100\n\n    Improve external locking on Windows\n    \n    commit 2c15248 improved external locking for POSIX.\n    See that commit for advantages of the technique used.\n    This implements the same technique for Windows systems.\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1033596\n    Change-Id: I298309bb1c84499f2060c172213d355aa7ce54e5\n",
