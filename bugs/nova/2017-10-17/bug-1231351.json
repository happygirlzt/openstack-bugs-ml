This patch unlinks instance images after deployment\n    finished, so that they can be deleted by cache clean up procedure and it\n    triggers the clean up procedure.\n    \n    The patch also separates the fetching of tftp and instance images as the\n    tftp image should be handled during the preparation of the environment,\n    while the latter is only needed for the actual deployment.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4b975c06e60ab0f854749c8d18fd743fe770c7b0\n    Closes-Bug: #1231351\n",
