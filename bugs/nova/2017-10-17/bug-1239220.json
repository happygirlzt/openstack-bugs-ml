Per review feedback, enabling the code path for\n    2.13 as well. Originally we had handled this by excluding\n    2.13 from requirements. With this we should be able to removing\n    the exclusion for 2.13 from global requirements.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie047f7201d8e6a9a9641000d387c4312506f49b1\n    Closes-Bug: #1239220\n",
