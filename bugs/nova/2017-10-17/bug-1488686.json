    "description": "When the linux bridge nova-network driver creates it's bridge, it makes an assumption that the bridge's mac will be the mac from the first device plugged into it. This is the case at first, when there is only one device. But, when more devices are plugged in, the default behavior is to take the lowest mac from all devices plugged in. This is a problem because there may be rules on the switch the initial interface is plugged into that prohibit traffic from anything but that interface's initial mac.\n\nWhat should happen is immediately after creating the bridge, if there is an interface available, the bridge's mac should be explicitly set to that interface's mac. This will effectively lock the mac on the bridge, and it will not try to use the lowest mac of all devices plugged in.",

This isn't a problem when the bridge is first\n    set up, because the bridged interface is the only interface attached.\n    But, when instance interfaces are attached, there is a chance a lower\n    mac could be assigned and the bridge will switch macs. This patch\n    always sets the mac on the bridge to the mac of the bridged interface.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf5333516a4c5487a3ee7c662e07028789bdd286\n    Closes-bug: #1488686\n",
