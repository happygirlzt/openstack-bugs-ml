    "description": "Root drives are not resized, so small images always lead to small root drives which are unusable in many cases.  This can be fixed by making images much larger, but this means transferring large (10G) files to compute hosts for each launch.  Ideally this will be taken care of by glance, but a simple bugfix for current release involves resizing the image to 10G after it is downloaded.",
