The agent is\n    only responsible for reporting guest infomation to dom0, and is not\n    directly responsible for any live-migration activity. Therefore, in\n    cases where PV drivers are running it is safe to fake the presence of\n    this information in xenstore. This plugin checks for such cases and\n    writes a fake PV tools information prior to live-migration.\n    \n    The information about the presence of pv driver or version is read\n    straight though xenstore and written back to xenstore.\n    \n    This information is checked by xapi (not nova) during live migration.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib9624a6f325516b0124ebdecebb0951f29ba3ac4\n    Closes-Bug: #1462295\n",
