I'm the author of this code and I was under the impression that utils.execute implied shell=True in the internal subprocess.popen call, but I see in utils.py that it assumes shell=False unless you specify a value, same as the popen default. I'll update my patch branch and either set shell=True or modify the code to use (sudo) sh -c \"echo 1 > ...\" instead of having tee's stdout to worry about in the first place.\n\nIt turns out that the code does indeed work just fine, enabling hairpin_mode on bridge ports successfully, but I'd definitely rather have it do so minus the cruft I stuffed in here.",
