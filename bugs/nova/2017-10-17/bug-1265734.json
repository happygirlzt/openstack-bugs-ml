    "description": "Hi,\n\nI have a question regarding choosing container for an image. For example for the testVM image provided in openstack dashboard the container is bare by defalut(bare container format means the image does not have a container or metadata), however when I use hortonworks hdp plugin image for centOS which container format should I use ?I doubt if I should use bare as this image has pre populated data like  hadoop-libhdfs,  hadoop-native,  hadoop-sbin and more.\n\nThe problem is my cluster remains in waiting state even though all the instances are active. So I wanted to make sure if using bare for the pre populated hdp QCOW2 image is fine or if it makes it useless.\n\nThank  you.",
