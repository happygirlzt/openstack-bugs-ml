    "description": "An admin user should be able to launch a VM and attach it to a tenant's network using the --nic option.  This did not work, it appear for two reasons: \n\n1) a change to the nova logic for fetching the set of valid networks for a user would set the tenant_id as a filter in the network query.  As a result, nova would only see networks belonging to the admin tenant itself.  \n\n2) The quantum change of whether a user has the ability to create a port on a network did not properly allow admins to create ports on the network of another tenant. \n\nChange #1 is in nova, change #2 is in Quantum.  Both should just be a few lines.",
