This is called when building a connector object to pass to cinder.  It's completely normal to get a warning if systool isn't installed if you don't use FibreChannel.   If you are trying to use Fibre  Channel, you would want to see these warnings.",

This seems inline to what the bug report suggests about cinder .\n\nNow I understand that this code is essential to discover the fc hbas on the compute node. To discover these, \"systool -c fc_host -v\" command is used and the warning is presented if systool command doesn't exist on the compute node.\n\nSo, we don't have to delete this code and keep it as it is. And close this bug?\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.",

There has been lots of other dead code found from things nova no longer users, I assumed this was another one.\n\nPerhaps the warning should mention its only required if you need Fibre Channel LUN attachments to VMs, when using libvirt. That would make this much less confusing.",
