Sometimes when we try to start an instance, it stucks at the \"build\" stage.\n\nThe problem does not appear anytime, its only sometimes, it also does not matter which image we choose or which settings.\n\nIn the logfiles the only thing i see is this in the \"scheduler.log\"\n\n2014-12-04 10:04:05.970 32066 DEBUG nova.openstack.common.periodic_task [-] Running periodic task SchedulerManager._run_periodic_tasks run_periodic_tasks /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nova/openstack/common/periodic_task.py:178\n2014-12-04 10:04:05.970 32066 DEBUG nova.openstack.common.loopingcall [-] Dynamic looping call sleeping for 60.00 seconds _inner /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nova/openstack/common/loopingcall.py:132\n\n(repeating)....\n\nAll other logfiles seems to be ok.
