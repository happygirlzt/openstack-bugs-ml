    "description": "Version in use: Havana, but I believe the issue exists in IceHouse\n\nAs per https://<email address hidden>/msg25179.html, I'd like to be able to specify multiple --image options (or rather the equivalent --block-device options). Further, I'd like to be able to specify a --image other than the first as the initial boot disk.\n\nThe documentation for the \"nova boot\" command makes no reference to the number of --image/--block-device options being limited to 1, and indeed describes a --boot-index option to allow a non-first disk to be booted. However, using multiple options simply does not work. What seems to happen is that the last option specified is used.\n\nI suggest the following implementation:\n\n    - an arbitrary number of --block-device (or equivalent --image, --sawp, --ephemeral or --block-device-mapping) options be allowed.\n\n    - any --block-device of type image be allowed to take a boot-index option. The boot-index option(s) must start at 0, and must not exceed the number of block-devices of type images. Duplicate values are not allowed.\n\n    - if no --block-device has a boot-index option, then the first such option shall default to --boot-index=0.",
