            "content": "This seems like something that would have to be expressed from the cinder side based on the volume type.\n\nCurrently the libvirt driver gets the os-brick volume connector and passes that use_multipath value in here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/14.0.1/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L1033\n\nThat's the connector that nova passes to os-initialize_connection in cinder which gives back the connection_info used when connecting the volume to the host.\n\nSo nova would need to know if it should use multipath or not before that, which we could maybe get from the volume/volume_type if cinder provided that information. Otherwise this is just how it's always worked.\n\nIf cinder started providing that info, it would have to probably be in a microversion in the cinder v3 API.",

            "content": "@Matt\nyeah, so I think this is more of a problem with Brick and how it's doing things than it is Nova.  We should IMO as you say be putting the multipath stuff in the volume (I wasn't actually thinking type, but extra info in the model; although type would work as well).  Either way, after looking at it more closely Nova is pretty much doing the only thing it can do currently given how this is setup on the other side.",
