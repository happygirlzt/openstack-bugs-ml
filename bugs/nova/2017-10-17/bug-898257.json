This has both advantages and disadvantages.\n    Also qemu-nbd is not supported on some systems like RHEL 6.\n    \n    * nova/virt/disk/api.py (img_handlers): Add guestfs to the default\n    list of access methods to try, to act as a fallback.\n    * nova/virt/disk/guestfs.py: A new plugin class to provide support\n    for libguestfs mounting.\n    Note we use the guestmount utility, as a non root user,\n    so the user will need the ability to use fusermount, which\n    is often provided by being a member of the 'fuser' group.\n    In future we might use the guestfs python module to give\n    greater granularity of control over the image.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2e22c9d149fff7a73cd8cebaa280d68d3fb9096c\n",
