    "description": "The trusted_filter assumes that all OAT attestation servers will return `vtime` in ISO8601 format. This is not the case with the Mt. Wilson attestation server, and there is no way to configure Mt. Wilson to do ship an appropriately formatted `vtime` which prevents trusted hosts from appearing in the available host list for instances booted from a flavor with the trust extra-spec.\n\nIt's a pretty trivial change to allow locale-formatted dates to be used in the trusted_filter as well.",

Wilson `vtime`\n    \n    The Trusted Filter expects that `vtime` is returned from the\n    attestation server in an ISO8601 format, but the Mt. Wilson\n    attestation server can return it in a locale appropriate string format\n    instead. There's no way to configure Mt.  Wilson to do the right thing\n    so we should just try to parse the returned `vtime` as a string\n    formatted date.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1353029\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic7351e0463c014321bdb4fcfeba90ac51460b325\n",
