However, calling it on the libvirt object\nwill, as you hypothesised, not check for disconnect, as it returns the\nlocal version of libvirt, rather than the remote version.\n\nWell spotted! I shall come up with a more backwards compatible ping\nmechanism :)\n\n-- \nSoren Hansen\nUbuntu Developer\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/",
