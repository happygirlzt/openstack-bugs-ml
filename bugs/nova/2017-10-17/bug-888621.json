In the latter\n    case, it's not easy to trap it because you'd have to bypass the kombu\n    interface and import amqplib and try to trap one of its exceptions.\n    What I've implemented here looks for 'timeout' in any exception, even\n    though I really don't like it. :)\n    \n    Fixes HACKING violations while I'm at it.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0132fbc4377e221b0a366d0340652147ddb33c87\n",
