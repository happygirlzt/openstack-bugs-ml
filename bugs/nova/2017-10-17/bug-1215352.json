The user would be\n    requested to enter a password but all attempts would fail.\n    \n    The 'vnc_password' was added as a workaround to the problem above.\n    \n    The fix ensures that the VMware driver behaves like all of the other\n    virt drivers when it comes to the VNC access, that is, the user will\n    not have to enter a password.\n    \n    The password support will be deprecated and removed in the next\n    version.\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1215352\n    \n    Change-Id: I728861b8965ee3d3b8444a0440ddd0a8e5bb9021\n",
