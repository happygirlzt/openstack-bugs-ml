However it also accidentally excluded sending\n    null as the metadata value which has previously allowed the\n    deletion of the metadata key rather than an update. This\n    changeset relaxes the input validation to allow deletion of\n    aggregate metadata again\n    \n    Change-Id: I54b91c2d421243e7e7521f2352598f73a258b88a\n    Closes-Bug: 1334846\n",
