By default,\n    MySQL silently truncates entries that are too long.  PostgreSQL\n    throws an error instead.  So we need to truncate the message field\n    before we try inserting into that column, to avoid errors from\n    very long messages in PostgreSQL (or MySQL configured to not allow\n    this).\n    \n    Fixes bug #1217167\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia959d64a8bc162a33ba818f1006e9779207b4796\n",
