    "description": "Every so often when rescuing an instance, the swap partition will be rescued. This seems to be due to a bug in vmops.py which assumes the rootfs VBD is going to be the second one returned if there are multiple disks (swap most likely is the first). This doesn't seem to be always true so it would make more sense to check for userdevice = \"0\".",
