This patch ensures that the parsing of the instances\n    is correct.\n    \n    The patch does the following:\n    1. In the method _list_running_instances it treats all instances\n       as an object\n    2. Fixes the bug mentioned below. The code was making a string from\n       None. This would lead to invalid image details.\n    3. Ensures that the unit tests actually pass instance objects instead\n       of an instance dict\n    4. In relevant tests updates assertEquals to have the expected parameter\n       first\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1354664\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib028baab4d4c823f22c371a83f7a813c24d77570\n",
