Installations may prefer their users to be stored in Redis (or - in future - whatever data store they're using for their Nova data)\n\nThis might be best done by implementing a proper provider model for the auth store.",

Until I can verify that none of the tests are depending on the fake users, I've changed it to only attempt to create if fake_tests is selected instead of fake_users.  This matches the original intent, which was to create users that could be used in the tests.  Longer term, the fix is to insure that all of the tests create the needed users in setUp or the constructor.",
