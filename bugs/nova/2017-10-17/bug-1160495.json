But the test above fails.\n\nAlso, adding 'root' user to libvirtd group on compute node  does not really either \n\nWhile looking at the patch:\nlog_file_path = '%s/%s.log' % (CONF.libvirt_log_path, instance_name)\n\nAssuming this libvirt_log_path = /var/log/libvirt ,  and as  /var/log is owned \nby 'root' user, then in the utils.execute, run_as_root=True is acceptable.\n\nIf the libvirt_log_path is configured to another path that is not owned by root,  say /opt/data/logs/xyz, \nthen we don't need 'run_as_root=True' to execute the command.\n\nBy adding '/bin/rm' to the compute filter and running it as root in the code is unsafe if some intrusive tests are added.\nThoughts on how this issue be addressed in CI, or code?\n\n",
