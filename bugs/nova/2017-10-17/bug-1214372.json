Thus all snapshots created don't have this property. Other\n    feature depend on 'os_type'(such as mkfs for ephemeral devices)\n    doesn't work.\n    \n    This patch fixes this by passing the 'os_type' attribute to glance\n    as image properties. None value in metadata properties would not be\n    passed to glance, thus this patch has no side effect on situation\n    when instance has no 'os_type' attribute set.\n    \n    Bug 1214372\n    \n    Change-Id: I2bab617f6c1e8866650ca7dc5178b640738c9ae6\n",
