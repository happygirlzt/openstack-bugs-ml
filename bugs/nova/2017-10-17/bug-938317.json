            "content": "I think fixing this may require some sort of rearchitecting of how nova does quota management.  The idea I have in mind specifically is that the quota check would be modified to also store a \"reservation\" if quota succeeds.  Once the instance (or whatever) is used, the reservation could be ticked over to the in-use count, and if it fails, it can simply be deleted.  (Of course, there should also be a synchronization to remove orphaned reservations\u2026)  Quota checks would then count not just the existing {instances,cores,ram,etc.} but also the existing reservations; this would be sufficient to prevent oversubscribing quotas this way.\n\n(Of course, there would have to be atomicity constraints on the quota check/reservation create.)",

Partially implements\n    blueprint quota-refactor as well.\n    \n    This change is fairly substantial.  To make it easier to review, it has been\n    broken up into 3 parts.
