Attempting to enable or\n    disable a nova-scheduler service, for example, will fail with a\n    404 error now.\n    \n    The enable_new_services config option is used to auto-disable\n    newly registered services to test them out before bringing them\n    into the pool of services for scheduling. This was really only\n    intended, and only makes sense for, nova-compute services. Disabling\n    scheduler, conductor, or API services does nothing functionally, and\n    requires the operator to later enable those services just to make\n    the GET /os-services output make sense.\n    \n    This change makes the enable_new_services config option only have\n    an effect on auto-disabling new nova-compute services. All other\n    services are ignored and will not be auto-disabled. The config\n    option help text is updated to make this clear.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie9cb44d3f87ba85420e2909170f4d207ec4bf717\n    Closes-Bug: #1697960\n",
