Spoke with s1rp about this and we could add the ability to do some simple load balancing to multiple glance-apis to distribute builds over multiple nodes and not overwhelm the single glance-api.",

Seems like a deployment detail to me.\n\nThat was my initial thinking too. \n\nI think the main reason for this is to give us an extremely easy way to test using multiple glances without having to deal with an external load-balancer.\n\nThe less moving parts in test and dev envs the better. In prod, though, we may still want to use an external LB component since it may be able to do a little better than just `random.choice`.",

I think at a\nminimum, there needs to be some plumbing done to allow those FLAGS to\nbe lists of host/ports and to round-robin the /images requests?\n\n-jay\n",
