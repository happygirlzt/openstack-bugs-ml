I'm guessing the reason it was presented as a disk drive was to allow the Linux guest to clear any sensitive data after the initial boot & consumption of config-drive data.  \n\nBut in a hack I've made to the nova-driver to support using IDE instead of virtio (triggered by a \"disk-bus-type\" = \"ide\" property in glance), I changed that code to also present the config-drive as a cdrom on 'hdb'.   Ideally, it would be nice if OpenStack could just \"know\" if the underlying image was Windows and then choose to present the config-drive as cdrom block-device, but that would require introspection of the image or require another glance-property to be set by the user.  \n\n",
