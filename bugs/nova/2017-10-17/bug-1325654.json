But as seen in the bug linked above it can sometimes raise an InstanceInfoCacheNotFound.  This is odd because it seems to mean that the instance was deleted but if that was the case then InstanceNotFound should have been raised before the info cache lookup began.  This behavior could use some further investigation.",
