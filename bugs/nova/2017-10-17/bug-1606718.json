The _report_hypervisor_resource_view method is\n    logging pci devices twice. On a compute with hundreds of pci\n    devices this blows up the logs in a short amount of time.\n    \n    This change removes at least the duplicate pci device logging\n    but we might want to even consider just not logging these in\n    each iteration. I've opted to at least push the simple fix for\n    now.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id05bfef44b1108dec286486d42516649dd0683e9\n    Closes-Bug: #1606718\n",
