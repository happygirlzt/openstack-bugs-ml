To be able to do that we\n    are leveraging the migration context (that used only for NUMA).\n    \n    Adds old and new PCI devices/ PCI requests into the MigrationContext\n    object and uses the nova.pci.request.get_pci_requests_from_flavor()\n    function to grab the set of requested PCI devices during a migration.\n    \n    Then, in the resource tracker's _update_usage_from_migration() call, we\n    use the old and new PCI devices and PCI requests stored in the\n    MigrationContext to properly account for changes.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1368201\n    Co-Authored-by: Jay Pipes <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie8690f2b7235d677ebe15fabaae81b0a6bda29de\n",

This caused a DB lookup of\n    the PCI requests for that instance, even though in all situations other\n    than for migration/resize, the instance's PCI requests were already\n    retrieved by the resource tracker.\n    \n    This change removes that additional DB lookup during claim_instance() by\n    changing the instance parameter to instead be an InstancePCIRequests\n    object and an InstanceNUMATopology object.\n    \n    Also in this patch is a change to nova.objects.PciDevice.claim() that\n    changes the single parameter to an instance UUID instead of an Instance\n    object, since nothing other than the instance's UUID was used in the\n    method.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1582278\n    Related-Bug: #1368201\n    \n    Change-Id: I9ab10c3035628f083233114b47b43a9b9ecdd166\n    (cherry picked from commit 1f259e2a9423a4777f79ca561d5e6a74747a5019)\n",
