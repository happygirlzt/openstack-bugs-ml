That would be sufficient to catch a subset of cases (where return is the first statement after finally). That seemed like a poor solution.\n\nThere is also the 'lines' argument that a check can use, but it effectively requires writing a parser for the Python language.\n\nI've thrown around the idea of parsing the AST but it was sufficiently different that I didn't know how something like that could get merged and I didn't want to hold up this patch.",

If a return is done, that will cause exceptions to be silently\n    ignored.\n    \n    Some unit tests have been failing because of API changes to the\n    nova.compute.manager:ComputeManager._delete_instance method but the\n    use of finally/return ended up silently ignoring that error and\n    caused the test to appear as if it was passing. Another unit test\n    fails because of a missing uuid attribute.\n    \n    It could also potentially cause other exceptions to be ignored at\n    runtime (such as SystemExit) which is likely not the intended\n    behavior.\n    \n    Change-Id: I083ee7215296e35a0027be5b3ddf8b764f44cc5b\n    Closes-bug: 1324277\n",
