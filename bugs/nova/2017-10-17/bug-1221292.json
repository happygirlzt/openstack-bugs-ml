To stop this\n    happening the code to create the cached images is now synchronized on\n    the image being fetched.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1226073\n    \n    Change-Id: I534fb8f42b00b5d39dc17dd5fee297144b5f379a\n",

            "content": "Because of the change to _find_cached_image, where it directly gets VDI, there is an issue with changing storage repository.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with the following sequence:\n1. Create a VM \n2. Switch storage repository (got a new flash card and want to use it instead of spindle disk).\n3. Create a VM with the same glance image\n4. The VM still gets created on old storage repository, even though _find_sr returns the new storage repository\n\nThe only way, I could find, to get the VM to spin up on the new storage repository is to delete all VMs from old storage repository (referring to the glance image) and then create a new one.
