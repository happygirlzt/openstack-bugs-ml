    "description": "In testing, I noted that when I use the OS API create image request (and using Glance as the image provider), additional metadata is added to an image beyond that provided with the create image request. For create image, the metadata provided by Glance appears to not be counted against the image metadata limits.  In contradiction to that, when using any of the /images/metadata range of requests, both the Nova and Glance generated metadata are counted towards the image's metadata limit. It seems that the behavior should be consistent.",
