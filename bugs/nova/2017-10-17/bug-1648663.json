In those cases, empty tags are being accepted and\n    stored as same.\n    \n    Main issue with those is that empty tag cannot be deleted/show as single\n    tag as it will again 404 with url not found. Only way to delete/show\n    such tag is to delete all together.\n    \n    Empty tag should not be allowed at first.\n    This commit makes empty string request to 400 which are\n    currently 200. Doing for server and device tags and same can\n    be adopted for other resource tagging also if any in future.\n    \n    Fixing this as bug fix hoping no backward incompatibility\n    logically. If such tag could have been deleted alone then we could have\n    fix this with microversion.\n    \n    Change-Id: I18a81f19205b2a40ca470067a9576f2f72ff0f13\n    Closes-Bug: #1648663\n",
