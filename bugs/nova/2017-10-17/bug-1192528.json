However, if you list_vms then for each ref call \"VM.get_VCPUs_max\" then that's all that's needed for the total vCPUs used.\n\nI'm not quite sure what should be returned here - looking at the libvirt driver as an example it sets vCPU max to the number of physical processors - which doesn't allow operators to decide how much to over-commit by, and you will easily exceed this \"maximum\"",
