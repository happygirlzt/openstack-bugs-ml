If SSL termination happens\n    upstream the request url is an http request, and the location header is\n    wrongly generated with that.  The osapi_glance_link_prefix config option\n    is available for almost precisely this purpose, so let's use it.\n    \n    Change-Id: I24e46ed8fc0763f9ddeec65e0d79590dd7b86bef\n    Closes-bug: 1298005\n",
