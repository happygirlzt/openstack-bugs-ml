Fix removes directories after tests finished.\n    Tests use fake instance, created with _create_instance. Method\n    _create_instance uses fixed uuid for instance object. Tests are executed\n    through several workers, so they could start simultaneously. If one test created\n    folder with the same uuid, the second one could delete it before the first\n    test finished. It could lead the first test to fail. The solution is to\n    use generated nstance uuid and delete particular uuid folder after test\n    is completed. Instance folder won't be deleted, as it could be used by\n    other tests.\n    \n    Change-Id: I985a414ac6dfc608e1a3ed68c580d0b08da45a91\n    Closes-Bug: 1664669\n",
