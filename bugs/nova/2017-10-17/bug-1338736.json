This value\n    was previously set in the notification but commit\n    70196c4854e6cc1cb566dc9fc5b1a3397a4b69ab changed things so that it was\n    no longer set.  It will now be set, and is tested to be set.\n    \n    Change-Id: If5ac00529d52e3898cda7fd942535ed3ba2039d5\n    Closes-bug: 1338736\n",
