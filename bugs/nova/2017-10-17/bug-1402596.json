I was able to see the same result by testing with devstack and horizon.\r\n\r\nWhat you are seeing is not a bug. In horizon when you choose the option \"Boot from image (creates new volume)\" what you are doing is creating a bootable volume from an image, and then booting the instance from that. That's why there is not an image associated with the instance. Please see this doc that explains more:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/create_volume_from_image_and_boot.html",

            "content": "Hi zyjyan,\n\nI understand. So, in this case with the \"Boot from image (creates new volume)\" the image information is associated with the volume, which is associated with the instance. If you go in horizon to the Volumes tab on the left, you'll see the volume that got created with your boot request and you'll also see it's attached to the instance you booted. If you then click on the volume to see the details, you'll find the image name under Volume Source.\n\nDoes that work okay for you? Or do you still wish to see the image name in the instances view? If so, are you requesting the behavior for horizon or the nova cli or both?",
