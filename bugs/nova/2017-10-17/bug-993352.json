    "description": "the noVNC proxy code is in flux, and we are helping to make it better.  THis bug is to track the effort, as it pertains to Openstack,\n\n1.  The noVNC upstream has copied in code from websockify.  We are working make each into an independent project, both of which will be part of the VNC solution for Nova.\n\n2.  noVNC's web proxy provides index browsing as part of its HTTP support, which is not correct. It should only provide the static HTML, CSS and Javascript in ordr to run the vnc viewer.\n\n3.  noVNC and Websockify need to get into the distributions as packages.  as such,  the Python code and executables need to follow the standards for location in the tree.  Python modules go into site libs,  binaries in  /usr/bin  and so forth.  The executables need novnc specific names to indicate their purpose.  \n\n4.  A shared library named rebind.so needs libool support if it is going to be shipped.  It is not needed for our uses,  so it can be removed for now.  When it does ship, it needs to go into /usr/lib[64] and support IPv6 as well as IPv4.",
