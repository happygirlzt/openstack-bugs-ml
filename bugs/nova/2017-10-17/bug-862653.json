            "content": "Okay. Spent a good bit of time tinkering w/ this issue this afternoon. The VDI resize code added in bf181c2 is absolutely the problem. If I comment it out I'm able to boot instances fine.\n\nI'm using XenServer 5.6 SP2:\n\n[root@xen1 ~]# cat /etc/*release\nXenServer release 5.6.100-46766p (xenenterprise)\n\nThis isn't an out of space issue for my SR. The same thing appears to happen on multiple Xen Servers. The SR's are pretty big and I can boot an instance normally. Furthermore I'm also able to do instances resizes and just about anything else on these machines which are all Dell R710's.\n\nWhen the instance fails to boot I can go to the machine and reproduce this manually with the following command:\n\n[root@xen1 ~]# xe vdi-resize uuid=b8714fde-9741-4ea0-b460-15c4e8b444df disk-size=20GiB\nError code: SR_BACKEND_FAILURE_110\nError parameters: , VDI resize failed [opterr=Command ['/usr/sbin/vhd-util', 'revert', '--debug', '-n', '/var/run/sr-mount/934ab597-ff32-94f6-c1da-9213c7f02a65/b8714fde-9741-4ea0-b460-15c4e8b444df.vhd', '-j', '.journal-b8714fde-9741-4ea0-b460-15c4e8b444df'] failed (2): ], \n\n---\n\nAlso. If I comment out this code I can boot instances fine:\n\n-        for vdi in vdis:\n-            if vdi[\"vdi_type\"] == \"os\":\n-                self.resize_instance(instance, vdi[\"vdi_uuid\"])\n\nFurthermore. I've verified that I can resize VDI's just fine for an instance once I've started and stopped the instance. So for example if I:\n\n1) boot an instance\n2) shut it down\n3) I can then resize the VDI on the command line just fine with 'xe vdi-resize' to sizes much large than 20 Gigs.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that VDI resizes appear to fail before we've spawned the instance at least once. Once we've spawned it we can shut it down and perform whatever resize we want.\n\n---\n\nSo as far as I can tell booting instances on stock XenServer 5.6 SP2 breaks w/ this commit. Is this a XenServer issue that I need a patch to fix or something?\n\n\n",

The image was fine and it booted w/ nova before this commit. Additionally my initial image was also resizable after it booted fully.\n\n---\n \nThe work around for me was to manually create a new OVA image by hand using the VHD of the booted instance on XenServer.  Creating a tar of that VHD with an empty manifest.ovf makes this issue go away.\n\nMy guess is that others might hit this same issue when using nova w/ XenServer. Specifically anyone booting an OVA image which wasn't created directly from a XenServer dom0.\n\nHope that helps. I didn't have time to track it any further.\n\nDan",
