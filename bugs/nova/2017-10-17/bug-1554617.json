This is an incorrect change, because the default of\n    getattr() is only used if AttributeError is raised. The original get()\n    call would return the default if the variable was not set, but in order\n    to get the default with getattr() 'in' has to be used. So now, the\n    getattr() calls are changed to:\n    \n    foo = aggregate.foo if 'foo' in aggregate else default\n    \n    Also, a comment was added for using getattr() on all aggregate fields,\n    explaining we can do the getattr() and not worry about metadata being\n    unset, because the compute API always sets it. nova.objects.base also\n    has a helper method to compare the primitives of two objects to check if\n    they're equal, so a helper method in the tests were changed over to use\n    that helper method.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iee651704c90fcdda0938f907924a4565399601d7\n    Closes-Bug: #1554617\n",
