To begin a new transaction with this Session, first issue Session.rollback(). Original exception was: (sqlite3.IntegrityError) UNIQUE constraint failed: instance_info_caches.instance_uuid \n\nWe are in a transaction, we can't have an integrity failure in a transaction, and then just continue working, we need to use a savepoint.\n\nThe problem could be reproduced e.g. in instance_info_cache_update but also could happen in other similar places where we pass an db exception.",
