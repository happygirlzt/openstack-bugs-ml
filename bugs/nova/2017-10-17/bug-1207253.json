The change\n    is done in a backwards compatible fashion such that previous\n    nova.conf files still work.\n    \n    As part of this update the sample file and text strings are\n    also updated to reflect new config options.  Test cases have\n    been adjusted to handle the config hierarchy.\n    \n    2642897d6f5b8a211424519d99feddc89c3bf180 was followed to\n    implement this change.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2e9f720ddce284fc112d6a5651fd277e6e31a17a\n    Closes-Bug: 1207253\n    DocImpact\n",
