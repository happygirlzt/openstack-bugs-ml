This token comparison is based on CONF.service_neutron_metadata_proxy being set which means the deployer is expecting the Neutron namespace proxy to be setup.  The namespace proxy does a lookup based on the ip address of the instance making a query to it, and populates the X-Instance-ID header based on that result and then forwards to the Nova metadata service.  I would hope that the metadata service would not be directly accessible from instances.\n\nIf the metadata service is accessible from instances and CONF.service_neutron_metadata_proxy is set to True then this would be theoretically vulnerable to a timing attack.  The result of which would be gaining access to information about another instance.  It should be noted that this bug includes Neutron as well since it performs the signing so any change would have to be coordinated across both services.",
