It's incorrectly reporting the hypervisor as QEMU though XenServer is in use as the hypervisor and the nova.conf contains --libvirt_type=xen. Here's what's displayed:\n\nHypervisor: QEMU( rdtscp, pdpe1gb, dca, xtpr, tm2, est, vmx, ds_cpl, monitor, pbe, tm, ht, ss, acpi, ds, vme)\n\nI found out that in this case it's actually a bug against nova, not against \"horizon\" the project for Dashboard.\nSays Anythony Young: \"we deploy compute in an ubuntu domu, which probably has libvirt installed.  nova needs to be fixed to report the right info, so it is actually a nova bug\"",
