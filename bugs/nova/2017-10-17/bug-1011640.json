    "description": "After rebooting a host, nova-compute fails to restart guests VM because the interface used to create vlan is not UP. In our case, this interface is not connected to a physical network and doesn't have an IP address, so it's not configured on boot.\n\nIt could be good to start nova-network even if vlan interfaces cannot be set up. Here, it crashes while trying to put a vlan interface UP, as you can see in the attached log file \n\nFor other people eventually affected by the problem, i initially wrote this script to manually configure network so nova-network can start successfully\n\n#!/bin/sh\n\nadd_network() {\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BR=br$1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VLAN=vlan$1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LAN=$2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BCAST=$3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vconfig add eth1 $1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0brctl addbr $BR\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0brctl setfd $BR 0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0brctl stp $BR off\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip link set $BR up\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip link show dev $BR\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0brctl addif $BR $VLAN\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip addr show dev $BR scope global\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ip addr add \"$LAN\" brd \"$BCAST\" dev $BR\n}\n\nvconfig set_name_type VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD\n\nadd_network 100 \"172.16.0.4/24\" \"172.16.0.255\"\nadd_network 101 \"172.16.1.4/24\" \"172.16.1.255\"\nadd_network 102 \"172.16.2.4/24\" \"172.16.2.255\"\nadd_network 103 \"172.16.3.4/24\" \"172.16.3.255\"\nadd_network 104 \"172.16.4.4/24\" \"172.16.4.255\"",
