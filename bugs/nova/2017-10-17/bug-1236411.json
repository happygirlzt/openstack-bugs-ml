However the exception is then caught and self.volume_api.roll_detaching(context, volume_id) is called which will make the volume 'in-use'. The it is reraised and the volume detach is aborted.\n\nThis doesn't seem correct, especially if two detach messages for the same volume manages to get to the compute manager, the volume would now be fully removed from host but remain 'in-use' in cinder db.\n\nIt would seem more appropriate to just ignore (after logging) DiskNotFound and continuing to detach from the volume driver and billing.",
