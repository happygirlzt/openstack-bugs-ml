Check if glance_api_servers is  set in nova.conf, if so use them\n2. If glance servers are not set in nova.conf, then look them up in keystone (assuming that keystone is being used) and set glance_api_servers to the result\n3. If neither, set it to None \n\nDoes this work ? \n\nAFAIK it should be a fairly trivial fix to nova/image/glance.py",
