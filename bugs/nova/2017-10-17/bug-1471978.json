A static\n    tree was used to maintain the current versions before, and that static\n    tree was checked against the current version of subobjects. This is now\n    changed over to have a tree with the current version of the subobjects,\n    and a tree with the version held in the most recent entry in\n    obj_relationships within the object.\n    \n    Because some versioning got stale, objects needed\n    to be updated to contain the correct versions of subobjects.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1471978\n    \n    Change-Id: I99f720725c9a3e7902de39e9aee533caa2c73847\n",
