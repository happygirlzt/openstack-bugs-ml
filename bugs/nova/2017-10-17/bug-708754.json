(I don't think that this was unanimously agreed.)\r\n\r\nIf we did this, then we'd remove image_service altogether, which is why nova.virt.xenapi is decoupled from that.\r\n\r\nI don't know of any problems that would arise if image_service was out of sync with xenapi_image_service -- I'm expecting xenapi_image_service to take effect when using virt.xenapi, and image_service to take effect when using virt.libvirt.\r\n",
