A server group is not actually a logical collection of servers, as you might expect from the name \"server groups\" -- name fail indeed.\n\nA server group is merely a way to tell the Nova scheduler to place a server instance near or not-near one or more other server instances.\n\nIn this way, when deleting a server group, it makes sense to just delete the group regardless of whether there are servers in the group, because the server group doesn't \"own\" the servers that were started with that group in the scheduler hints.",

Otherwise there is no way to ensure that the scheduler placement still holds if we do a resize/migration/evacuation/etc.\n",
