    "description": "It was pointed out in http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-February/086746.html that configuration options included in paste.ini are less than optimal, because they impose an upgrade burden on both operators and engineers. The following discussion expanded to all projects (not just those using paste), and the following conclusion was reached:\n\nA) All generated configuration files should contain any headers which the API needs to operate. This is currently supported in oslo.config's generate-config script, as of 3.7.0\nB) These same configuration headers should be set as defaults for the given API, using cfg.set_defaults. This permits an operator to simply activate a domain, and not have to worry about tweaking additional settings.\nC) All hardcoded headers should be detached from the CORS middleware.\nD) Configuration and activation of CORS should be consistent across all projects.\n\nIt was also agreed that this is a blocking bug for mitaka. A reference patch has already been approved for keystone, available here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/285308/",
