It's a bit tricky to get the security model for this right, though.\r\n\r\nThe current model is to allow sudo to run \"/usr/bin/nova-rootwrap\", which loads nova.rootwrap.wrapper from a pristine sys.path, which then tries to load a number of predetermined FILTERS_MODULES files. Adding more dynamic loading capabilities (like loading all files present under nova.rootwrap.filters) weakens this model a bit, but is probably still safe. You would then just package a nova.rootwrap.filters.myownextension together with your extension.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could allow sudo to run \"/usr/bin/nova-rootwrap --config /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf\" which would point to a list of files to load... but it makes in-branch testing a bit more difficult, and is also more error-prone (you have to replicate the config file location in the root_wrapper config option).\r\n\r\nI'll add this to my Folsom improvements list.",
