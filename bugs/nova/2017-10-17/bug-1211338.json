It appears that qpid is case-sensitive about exchange types, so the version with the capital D is invalid.  This ends up causing qpid to throw an error like:\n\n>> \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/qpid/messaging/endpoints.py\",\n>> line 567, in _ewait\\n    self.check_error()\\n', '  File\n>> \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/qpid/messaging/endpoints.py\",\n>> line 556, in check_error\\n    raise self.error\\n', 'NotFound:\n>> not-found: Exchange type not implemented: Direct\n>> (qpid/broker/SessionAdapter.cpp:117)(404)\\n']\n\nIt should be a one-character fix.",
