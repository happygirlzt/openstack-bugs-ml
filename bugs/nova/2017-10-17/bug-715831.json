And if'ts possible we have to change the name of the variable in a later release, because it's confusing to configure the ActiveMQ with parameters called rabbit_*. But if we change it in a later release there are a lot of users who have to change there configurations. Or we have to introduce a new parameter for each new supported AMQP system, leading to a lof of repetitions in the code. I think the name of parameters should generally be as independent as possible from the underlying used software.",
