To test simply load an Image and make some file alterations, then resize and all changes will be lost. I'm not sure if this is working as intended but I'm assuming not; and if not then it is a critical bug resulting in 'libvirt_images_type=lvm' being unusable with resize.\n\nFurther testing reveals this happens with Migrations as well leaving me to believe this is NOT working as intended and leaves LVM critically unusable.",

The problem is addressed by raising a NotImplementedError.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1270305\n    Closes-Bug: #1245595\n    Closes-Bug: #1241866\n    Change-Id: I8010230b1aa5ddc322d0c93dd916b7700c25ab81\n    DocImpact\n",
