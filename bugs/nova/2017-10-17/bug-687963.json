It means that unless a logfile is explicitly set, workers who deamonise through nova.server.daemonize() end up logging to syslog instead of a separate logfile. That default should probably be changed to match the behaviour of the other workers.\n\nSetting a logfile explicitly is not cool, because that would require nova-api to have a separate flagfile.",
