This is sub-optimal because the default KVM CPU\n    model has changed a number of times, and more importantly\n    VMs are not able to take advantage of many performance\n    features in newer CPUs. To get a consistent CPU model exposed\n    to the guest and maximize performance of VMs in the cloud,\n    explicit specification of CPU models per host is desirable.\n    \n    This change adds a new Nova config flag:\n    \n      libvirt_cpu_mode = host-model|host-passthrough|custom\n    \n    Where\n    \n      * host-model == configure a model that matches the features\n                      available in the host CPU\n    \n      * host-passthrough == passthrough the host CPU precisely\n                            with no change at all\n    \n      * custom == configure a specific named CPU model\n    \n    If the 'custom' mode is used, then the additional flag\n    is available to choose the model:\n    \n      libvirt_cpu_model = <one of the names from /usr/share/libvirt/cpu_model.xml>\n    \n    eg\n    \n      libvirt_cpu_model = core2duo\n    \n    If specifying a custom CPU model, it is wise to choose one that is\n    capable of running on all the various different Nova hosts in the\n    cloud. That said, libvirt will enforce compatibility at time of\n    starting or migrating guests & refuse the operation if required.\n    \n    If using either the host-model or host-passthrough modes, and use\n    of live migration is desired, admins should ensure that all hosts\n    have a homogeneous CPU model. If hosts have a hetergeneous CPU\n    models, then a custom named CPU model is a better choice\n    \n    This configuration only works for libvirt >= 0.9.10, due to the\n    use of the 'mode' attribute on the <cpu> element for configuring\n    host models.\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1003373\n    Implements: blueprint libvirt-xml-cpu-model\n    Change-Id: I90ce78d7e29bd0d563e3bc547b7cc5d64dd9496e\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.

We\n    can not support mode=host-passthrough at all with these\n    earlier libvirt versions\n    \n    This change can be reverted in the future, if the value of\n    the MIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION constant is increased to 0.9.10\n    or later\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1003373\n    Implements: blueprint libvirt-xml-cpu-model\n    Change-Id: I3e55ffccf38be18454f810efeb5c201aab94ddb0\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.

This means they are all using the per-hyervisor\n    default settings for CPU model. With KVM/QEMU guests the model was\n    traditionally a very conserative choice which exposed minimal features.\n    This is significantly limits the performance of applications. Further\n    the model has changed over time, so the exact default model is\n    unpredictable. Switching Nova to use the host CPU model by default\n    should improve the out of the box performance & give a known\n    setup.\n    \n    This does not impact migration compatibility, since the migration\n    code is already doing comparison checks against the source and\n    destination host CPU model, regardless of the actual model used\n    in the guest. In the future the migration code should be tweaked\n    so that it actually compares the current guest CPU model, against\n    the target host CPU model, which would potentially broaden the\n    migration compatibility pool.\n    \n    With this patch there is a new libvirt_cpu_mode=\"none\" which\n    can be used to explicitly prevent any CPU model setting in the\n    instance XML. The default value None, will now default to\n    \"none\" for LXC/UML/etc, and \"host-model\" for QEMU/KVM\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1003373\n    Implements: blueprint libvirt-xml-cpu-model\n    Change-Id: I5b96e4532b6a960e1608dd6e19ae9d194379fb6a\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.
