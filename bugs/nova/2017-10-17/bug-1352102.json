This patch changes\n    it to a policy based check instead with the default setting being\n    admin only. This allows operators to more precisely configure who\n    they wish to allow to attach external networks without having to\n    give them admin access\n    \n    Change-Id: I59e71f117f889f2abffddc36c1870ef1e0fe3711\n    DocImpact: Adds network:attach_external_network policy\n    Closes-Bug: #1352102\n",
