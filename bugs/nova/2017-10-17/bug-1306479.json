This updates the code\n    to use safe_encode correctly when the object gets rendered.\n    \n    This also adds unit tests for the rendering functionality in\n    ec2/apirequest so that we can actually feel confident that it does the\n    right things with unicode.\n    \n    Change-Id: I348a728e3559fdbf0d1bc66616cc278c3370cd29\n    Closes-Bug: #1306479\n",

Bring it into the test_apirequest to for logical cohesion in\n    the code. This should also make it simpler for people to expand on\n    this validation later in one place if they want to.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib9a09034b1b677b462eb0384396cd9bc64f73045\n    Related-Bug: #1306479\n",
