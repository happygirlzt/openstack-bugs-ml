Currently the code doesn't manage properly the None value for this\n    property and so None value is passed to glance which creates an image with\n    a property called 'os_type' with value 'None'.\n    As results of that all instances booted from a snapshot with this property will\n    have None value in the os_type field.\n    That field is used to create file name for backing images for ephemeral disks.\n    Now consider this scenario:\n    we boot an instance from an image without the os_type property defined and\n    with an ephemeral disk of 50 G\n    the resulting backing file will be called ephemeral_50_default.\n    At this point we take a snapshot from that instance and we boot a new instance\n    using this snapshot, and because of this bug we will have a new backing file\n    called ephemeral_50_None.\n    That is bad because is leaking resources in the host.\n    \n    Please note that I did a small refactor of the code to make my change testable.\n    \n    Change-Id: I40bca2732ee2c911344e9d361612007da1c7c3cf\n    Closes-bug: #1240542\n",
