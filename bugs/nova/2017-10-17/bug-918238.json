The issue roots from RabbitMQ.\n\nRabbitMQ (and therefore Kombu) is not returning the actual error code to the Nova api code at all.  By design, RabbitMQ simply disconnects the client connection on authentication error ... As a result IOError is all we can report.\n\nHere\u2019s the traceback:\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/56773/\n\nSome resources that document this RabbitMQ behavior:\nhttp://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2010-May/007095.html\nhttp://clojurerabbitmq.info/articles/error_handling.html (see the Authentication Failures section)\n\nRabbitMQ 3.2 (released Oct 2013) introduces \u201cAuthentication Failure Notifications\u201d, which allows authentication exceptions to be caught by the client.\n\nhttp://www.rabbitmq.com/auth-notification.html\n\nI\u2019m not sure if Kombu is capable of processing the new RabbitMQ 3.2 \u201cAuthentication Failure Notifications\u201d yet.  Pending further investigation.\n",
