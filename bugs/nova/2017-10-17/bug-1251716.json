This happens during spawn and resize. Should any of\n    those operations happen at the same time, we run the risk of hitting the\n    above bug.\n    \n    This change works around this issue by ensuring there is only ever one\n    VBD plug at once, per VM.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1251716\n    Change-Id: Ie7a64c481a9e3874df9d5924fbb050ac7ab117db\n",
