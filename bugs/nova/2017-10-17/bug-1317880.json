Select an ISO image and define the volume to attach.\n\nThe instance would then fail to boot with the error that the /image/ is not found.\n\nWhen booting from an image, vs booting from an image and attaching a volume there should be no difference to the handling of the image.... surely the only difference should be creating and attaching a volume in addition to booting from the image.",
