This is absurd, because the mode was 644, so it shouldn't have mattered in the slightest.  Nonetheless, after over a week debugging this (going so far as to add custom debug code, strace'ing relevant processes, doing an md5sum comparison of a working host and a non-working one; I pulled out all the stops!), this simple change fixed it for me instantly.",
