This led to\n    making compute_api.get take either and try to do the right thing. This\n    unfortunately meant we exposed the indexed integer ids over the\n    OpenStack API, which was never intended.\n    \n    ... and turns out to totally explode because of the way we cache\n    requests for extensions to post process them. The hide_address\n    extension shows a nice bit of exploding which has been noticed by our\n    users.\n    \n    Remove the int id facility. Remove the test for it. Update the other\n    tests that were sneaking in and using id==1 like very naughty folks\n    (there will be coal in your stocking this year).\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1522536\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibff4cebe71714ac9c470337c2ee5f57df4343829\n",

Having a dedicated place to put these\n    seems like a good idea. They are in no way an attempt to test all the\n    things, they are specific tests that demonstrate a bug, and ensure\n    that once that particular bug is fixed, it will not come back.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idfd8680133197beabaf6e1ac8df7490c2a345b17\n    Related-Bug: #1522536\n",
