Launch an instance\n2. Create a test file and sync the disk in the instance\n4. Sync the disk on the host and verify that the test file was written to disk by grepping the strings in /dev/nova-lvm/instance_..._disk for the test file contents\n5. Initiate instance migration using Horizon interface\n6. Confirm migration\n7. On the destination host check that the test file is missing by grepping for it in /dev/nova-lvm/instance_..._disk\n8. Check that the original LVM volume is still there by listing /dev/nova-lvm/",

The problem is addressed by raising a NotImplementedError.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1270305\n    Closes-Bug: #1245595\n    Closes-Bug: #1241866\n    Change-Id: I8010230b1aa5ddc322d0c93dd916b7700c25ab81\n    DocImpact\n",
