    "description": "When deleting VMs  and deallocating their network resources, the Quantum Network Manager get_port_by_attachment() call first fetches a list of all port-ids, then queries the ports individually until it finds a port with a particular attachment-id.  \n\nIf multiple deletes are happening simultaneously, there may be port-ids in the list that are deleted by the time we query the port individually.  As a result, we need to properly handle the 404 returned by Quantum, and continue searching.  \n\nNote: once we can update this client code to use filters, this entire problem will go away (along with the obvious inefficiencies).",
