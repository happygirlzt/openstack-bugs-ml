    "description": "I have enabled automatic assignment of floating IPs to newly created instances. These IPs get allocated and assigned to the instances -- I can connect to the instances using the IPs and they show up in the horizon dashboard when I view the instance information details.\n\nHowever, the \"Access & Security\" tab of the dashboard neither shows the IPs as allocated nor assigned. The \"nova floating-ip-list\" also fails to list them in any way.\n\nAttempting to remove such an automatically allocated IP using \"nova floating-ip-delete\" results in the following error message:\n\nERROR: ('Floating ip %s not found.', 'THE_IP_IN_QUESTION')\n\n\"nova-manage floating list\" lists these IPs, however.\n\nWhen the instance is terminated, the automatically allocated IP winds up as still allocated, but to a missing instance (possibly connected to bug #997763).\n\nThe effect of all this is that only the admin has command-line read-only access to automatically assigned floating IPs, and the only way I've figured out to clean up after the \"leak\" caused by terminating instances is to remove the block of floating IPs and then add them again using the \"nova-manage\" command.\n\nOperating System: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS\nOpenStack version: Essex (installed from Ubuntu packages)",
