The expectation is that it will be off in most situations. The disadvantage of the change that you are requesting is that we can no longer test migrate on a single host.\n\nPlease comment if you strongly disagree with this decision.\n\nIf we do decide to change it the logic should be\n\nif not FLAGS.allow_resize_to_same host or not flavor_id:",

Obviously a migrate should still be a migrate to another host.\n\nAfter reading your comment, I'm convinced that trying to do this 'live' resize of changing the VCPU and memory count of a VM on the same host through the current resize API call is probably not what I want to do.\n\nWould this be something that we would want to try to expand into the current resize API or would this be better off as a blueprint for adding a whole new \"live\" resize call path from the API down to the driver?",
