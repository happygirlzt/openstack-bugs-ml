The reason it's probably not validated is due to the fact that no one seems to know how the user can set it, because it's not set via the flavor-create API.\n\nThe only code using it is in the xenapi virt driver, so I'm wondering if they have something working out of tree at Rackspace that uses it?\n\nIf the user can't set it via the code that's in community, maybe it should be removed?",
