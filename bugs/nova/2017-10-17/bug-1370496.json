I have not seen the failure on the 1st step, but this does not mean automatically that it won't happen there too.\n\nThis could be just a red herring, since this message is very common: http://logs.openstack.org/89/119589/24/check/check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full/159af17/logs/screen-n-cpu.txt.gz#_2014-09-10_21_43_18_577\n\nIt seems however the instance was stopped early, and this could justify the failed connection.\n\nIt sounds like the volume does not get correctly attached to the instance, however no anomaly is reported by cinder logs:\nhttp://logs.openstack.org/89/119589/24/check/check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full/159af17/logs/screen-c-vol.txt.gz#_2014-09-10_21_42_44_822\n\nFinally, libvirt logs appears to report no errors. perhaps something could be found in qemu logs, which need to be searched for nova's vm uuid.",

If that's correct, it's a bit disheartening that this bug hasn't seen any change since last October.\n\nMy interpretation of the logs at http://logs.openstack.org/14/146914/1/check/check-tempest-dsvm-neutron-full/e1fee15/ is that the problem is that the instance isn't getting its IPv4 address; the instance's console output includes:\n\nStarting network...\nudhcpc (v1.20.1) started\nSending discover...\nSending discover...\nSending discover...\nNo lease, failing\n[...]\n=== network info ===\nif-info: lo,up,127.0.0.1,8,::1\nif-info: eth0,up,,8,fe80::f816:3eff:fefb:eaa7\n\nSo, I wonder if anyone can throw light on two questions:\n\n1. Assuming that DHCP _should_ be working in the failing test, and that the instance _should_ be getting its IPv4 address from DHCP, can anyone see why that is now not working?\n\n2. Is elastic-recheck correct to map the test failure that I'm seeing to this bug?",
