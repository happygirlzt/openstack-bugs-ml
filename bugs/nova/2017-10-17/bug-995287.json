This means the translation files in LP are generated with old data. Need to sync to LP properly or start looking at transifex and make sure transifex has an up to date .pot.\n\nSecond, at runtime Nova installs the translations but appears to only look in the default location for the translation files. You can probably only expect these to be there when installing from a package that installs to normal system locations. In many cases these files may be in a python egg or non system locations. Need to make the translation installation a little smarter about where it looks for things. The sphinx example above appears to deal with this issue.",

            "content": "Summary of what the sphinx code Monty points to actually does:\n\n  1) it provides a l_() function which delays the actual translation of the string until the string's value is needed. This appears to be for the case where a module wants to define a translatable string at import time, but not have the translation happen until runtime. With C, you'd similarly mark a string using N_() and translate it using gettext() at runtime\n\n  2) it has a locale.init() function which allows you to pass in multiple localedirs and it will use translations from any .mo files found in those dirs by merging them all into a single catalog. This is basically an improved gettext.install().\n\nI don't know any cases where we need (1) yet - but we might in future.\n\nI also don't think fixing this bug requires (2) - for any given translation domain, there's only ever a single directory in any installation where we need to look up translations.",

            "content": "The issue here is that, for each translation domain, we need to support configuring the localedir.\n\nAt first thought, it might seem like this should be configurable via the CLI and config files (i.e. using cfg) but this needs to be configured before we ever translate a single message ... and we need to support translating messages before cfg is ever called.\n\nIn C programs, you'd typically configure this at build-time and the localedir would be baked into the binaries. We don't really have an equivalent of that with Python.\n\nThe default localedir in Fedora is /usr/share/locale - so if we install nova.mo under /usr/share/locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES then what we do now actually works fine. I assume this is true of all distros.\n\nThe case where we want to configure an alternative localedir is devstack - e.g. if you run 'python setup.py compile_catatlog', then nova.mo will be under /opt/stack/nova/nova/locale/$lang/LC_MESSAGES/\n\nI think we should simply add support for this via env variables e.g.\n\n  gettext.install('nova', unicode=1, localedir=os.environ.get('NOVA_LOCALEDIR'))\n\nand you'd run e.g. nova-api in devstack with:\n\n  $> NOVA_LOCALEDIR=/opt/stack/nova/nova/locale /opt/stack/nova/bin/nova-api",
