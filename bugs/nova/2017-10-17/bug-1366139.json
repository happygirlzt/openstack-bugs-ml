    "description": "The nova metadata request handler uses an in-memory cache of 15 seconds. Under very heavy usage of the metadata service, this can drastically limit the cache hit rate, since it expires so quickly.\n\nAdding the ability to control the cache timeout has, in our tests, increased the average cache hit rate from around 20% to 80% or better with approximately a thousand metadata calls per minute.",
