When OpenStack talks about weight, it doesn't mean mass but a statistical property.\n\nSuch properties are used when \"weighting\" the members of a class, when producing a weighted average or a weighted index. But some of the OpenStack documentation talks about \"weighing\".\n\nHere are some samples from nova docs:\n\nCorrect:\n# If we speak about `filtering` and `weighting`, their work is quite\n# flexible in the Filter Scheduler.\n\nIncorrect:\n# During its work Filter Scheduler firstly makes dictionary of unfiltered\n# hosts, then filters them using filter properties and finally chooses hosts\n# for the requested number of instances (each time it chooses the most weighed\n# host and appends it to the list of selected hosts).\n\nUnfortunately, the API docs are sometimes rather unhelpful, containing explanations like this gem:\n\n# def weight_multiplier(self):\n# \"\"\"How weighted this weigher should be.\n\nRelated (in openstack-manuals): bug 1335423",
