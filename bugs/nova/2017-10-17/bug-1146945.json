The example that uncovered this issue goes something like this:\n\n1. Create an instance of a specific flavor\n2. Delete the flavor\n3. Call \"nova rescue\" on the aforementioned instance .\n\nWhile it is arguably reasonable for the request to fail in this case, it does not seem necessary to alter the state of the instance.",
