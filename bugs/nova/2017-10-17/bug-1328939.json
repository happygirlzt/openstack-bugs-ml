We currently hard code this value to /dev/sda1 to duplicate the old nova-bm behavior. While this makes things work for TripleO [1], we should do something smarter to determine the true partition value to set (e.g., a Cirros image value should be /dev/vda1).\n\nWe could consider using something like udev by-label names (e.g., /dev/disk/by-label/NNN). This obviously adds a requirement on udev.\n\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic/+bug/1324286",
