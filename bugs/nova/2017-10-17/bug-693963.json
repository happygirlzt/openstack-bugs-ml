To work well, you need every test to inherit the behaviour transparently.\r\n\r\nGood point about tests that are expecting failure.  You need to trigger a test error, not a failure.  Errors mean \"the test is broken\", whereas failures mean \"the test executed, but failed\".\r\n\r\nEwan.\r\n\r\n> -----Original Message-----\r\n> From: <email address hidden> [mailto:<email address hidden>] On Behalf Of\r\n> Armando Migliaccio\r\n> Sent: 27 December 2010 09:21\r\n> To: Ewan Mellor\r\n> Subject: [Bug 693963] Re: run_tests.sh wants sudo privs\r\n> \r\n> What happens if the code that uses sudo has been designed to face\r\n> failure?
