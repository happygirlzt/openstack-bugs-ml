    "description": "I noticed when performing a \"nova image-show\" on a current (not deleted) image, two HTTP requests were issued. Why isn't the Image retrieved on the first GET request?\n\nIn fact, it is. The problem lies in _extract_attributes(), called by _translate_from_glance(). This function loops through a list of expected attributes, and extracts them from the passed-in Image. The problem is that if the attribute 'deleted' is False, there won't be a 'deleted_at' attribute in the Image. Not finding the attribute results in getattr() making another GET request (to try to find the \"missing\" attribute?). This is unnecessary of course, since it makes sense for the Image to not have that attribute set.",
