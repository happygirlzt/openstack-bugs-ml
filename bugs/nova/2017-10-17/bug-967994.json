In general we lean towards not messing with guest instances, so it should be the responsibility of the guest to setup keypairs.  In fact, keypair injection should be optional and I would expect most cloud providers to turn it off.\n\nBy the way, libvirt can try to inject passwords as well via the config option:\n\nlibvirt_inject_password=true\n\n",
