It did back in Mitaka, but in Newton the policy for Nova was all moved into code. The \"compute:get_all\" rule was for the old v2 API.\n\nWith the v2.1 API the rule is now something like \"os_compute_api:servers:index\" or \"os_compute_api:servers:detail\" depending on the actual API that is called.\n\nThis is a minor issue, very low severity, but the docs could be updated to replace \"compute:get_all\" with \"os_compute_api:servers:detail\" for the example.\n\n-----------------------------------\nRelease: 15.0.0 on 2017-04-10 10:26\nSHA: 42e384ee11368ba8ad1545b6bd3042ee66954062\nSource: https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/openstack-manuals/tree/doc/config-reference/source/policy-json-file.rst\nURL: https://docs.openstack.org/ocata/config-reference/policy-json-file.html",
