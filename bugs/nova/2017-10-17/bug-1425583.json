    "description": "I am using a Nova version 2014.2.2 setup with VirtIO. I am trying to attach a volume via VirtIO driver to a machine with an ISO boot image. However, nova does not create a configuration for the volume attaching it via VirtIO but rather via IDE. The following steps are causing the problem.\n\nFirst I create a new instance, which works fine:\n\nnova boot --flavor 1 --image gentoo.iso --nic net-id=bea32667-0d4d-4546-877a-9cff5551d164 test-vm\n\nThen I try to attach a volume via VirtIO. I will explain, why I use vdb later:\n\nnova volume-attach test-vm 28c2ce69-4430-4216-8758-3fe4a3d8d322 /dev/vdb\n\nThe volume is then attached as /dev/hdb to the instance instead of /dev/vdb. The log shows the following:\n\n2015-02-25 16:44:04.028 10549 DEBUG nova.compute.utils [req-934ddef9-103a-4ad0-b05c-12f0857b9174 None] Using /dev/hd instead of /dev/vd get_next_device_name /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/nova/compute/utils.py:174\n\nWhen I try to attach the volume to /dev/vda it fails completely, because then Nova tries to attach it to /dev/hda that it assumes to be already occupied by the cdrom emulation with the ISO image.\n\nI looked into the utils.py file and could not really figure out the reason why the prefix is created based on the root device name. So I am not sure whether this is a bug or intended functionality. In the latter case I would appreciate an explanation especially how to enforce the attachment via VirtIO only for the one device in question.\n\nThank you and best regards",

            "content": "Ok, it is good to hear that the code is expected to work that way. However, I find the explanation for the method confusing, thus leading me to the assumption of a bug. Because in my case device actually is set with e.g. /dev/vdb but the method still returns /dev/hdb. Based on the method description I did not expect that kind of behavior. For me it is fine so far since I patched the file for my installation, still I would suggest to at least clarify the method description to avoid confusion in the future.",
