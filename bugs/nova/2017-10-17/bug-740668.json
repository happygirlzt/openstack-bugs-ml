It would be *a lot* easier if you only supported one version at a time : -)  That said, it makes sense to have a single API that can talk 1.0 and 1.1, because you may have to interact with deployments  running either version.  You'll have to abstract the lower level details away...that is create your own language binding types and then have two ways of serializing them.  A user should be able to query what version he's bound to and if a request is not appropriate for a particular that should raise a not supported error or whatever.\n\n\n> I saw a new namespace: http://docs.openstack.org/common/api/v1.0  What's\n> that?\n\nThat's the namespace reserved for stuff that's common between APIs.  For example versioning, extension, and rate limiting requests will not vary between APIs.  The idea there is that when you're writing a language binding you can add support for this meta API stuff and share it between say the compute, volume, and image APIs etc.\n\n> \n> In any case, do you want to propose these files for merge into lp:nova?\n\nI'd like to, some things are still in the air though.  One big question that came up last week was how are we going to handle IDs for example.  There are also questions about how affinityId works.  So I still see the API 1.1 changing somewhat.  Maybe we should wait until it stabilizes a bit before we move it over. \n\n> \n> -- \n> You received this bug notification because you are a direct subscriber\n> of the bug.\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/740668\n> \n> Title:\n>  No XML schema for OpenStack API v1.1?\n> \n> Status in OpenStack Compute (Nova):\n>  Confirmed\n> \n> Bug description:\n>  I can't find an XML schema for the OpenStack API v1.1 (nor the correct\n>  XML namespace)\n> \n>  Should we just be using the CloudServers v1.0 XSD schema, even with\n>  the v1.1 API?\n> \n> To unsubscribe from this bug, go to:\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/740668/+subscribe\n\n\n\nConfidentiality Notice: This e-mail message (including any attached or\nembedded documents) is intended for the exclusive and confidential use of the\nindividual or entity to which this message is addressed, and unless otherwise\nexpressly indicated, is confidential and privileged information of Rackspace. \nAny dissemination, distribution or copying of the enclosed material is prohibited.\nIf you receive this transmission in error, please notify us immediately by e-mail\nat <email address hidden>, and delete the original message. \nYour cooperation is appreciated.\n\n",
