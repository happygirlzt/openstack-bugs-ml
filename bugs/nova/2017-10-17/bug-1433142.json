Added logging to nova.service.reset method:\n\nash@ubuntu:/opt/stack/nova$ git diff\ndiff --git a/nova/service.py b/nova/service.py\nindex 3ae307c..5f4e952 100644\n--- a/nova/service.py\n+++ b/nova/service.py\n@@ -366,6 +366,7 @@ class WSGIService(object):\n         :returns: None\n \n         \"\"\"\n+        LOG.exception(\"Calling reset!\")\n         self.server.reset()\n \n     def _get_manager(self):\n\n\n2. Changed logging format in nova.conf to show pids\n\n3. Started nova-api in daemon mode with the default number of workers (metadata_workers = 2, ec2_workers = 2, osapi_compute_workers = 2)\n\n4. Verified that all processes are running:\n\nash@ubuntu:~/devstack$ ps -ef | grep nova-api\nash      11999  9714  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:04 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12008 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12009 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12010 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12011 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12018 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12019 11999  0 13:00 pts/10   00:00:00 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-api\nash      12245  8600  0 13:10 pts/32   00:00:00 grep --color=auto nova-api\n\n5. Sent SIGHUP to the parent process:\n\nash@ubuntu:~/devstack$ kill -HUP 11999\n\n6. Checked nova-api's logs: http://paste.openstack.org/show/195347/\n\nPlease note, that the parent process (pid = 11999) didn't call reset().\n\nThe situation is the same for all services that use ProcessLauncher including neutron. Please, correct me, if there is something I'm missing.\n ",
