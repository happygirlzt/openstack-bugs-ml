The policy rule in the first bullet was old so it's updated.\n    \n    2. As of Ifa4e9cdfbbac1a1d4bf28679b24a17b13f637ddd in Pike,\n       Horizon no longer allows you to 'edit' a flavor by default.\n       Rather than try to explain historical bad behavior and the\n       new default behavior in the Dashboard, the second bullet is\n       simply removed.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1715995\n    \n    Change-Id: I372bf1e159d1db32461f843bd94c453d2e7df8d2\n",
