    "description": "The default RADOS user (admin) is not overrideable in Essex. The admin user has access to anything in a RADOS cluster, so this prevents privilege separation (i.e. restricting reading and writing by Nova's RBD driver to a specific RADOS pool.) This is fixed in master commit 01f24caba86c987b0109f743979a4e99e8afed11, and is proposed for the stable essex branch at https://review.openstack.org/#change,6288.",
