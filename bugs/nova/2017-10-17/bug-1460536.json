User can sent this request after instance was booted success.\nSecond is add new option, which is number type, named mount_after_seconds., then compute will wait the time and mount it.\nBut it have other problems, such as compute failed will cause original disk been mounted anymore.\n\nI was prefer first solution. Does anyone have any great suggest.",
