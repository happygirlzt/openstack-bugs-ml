Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Feb 25 15:47:35 2013 +0000\n\n    Add a 'hw_' namespace to glance hardware config properties\n    \n    This updates the libvirt driver to use a 'hw_' prefix on\n    the names of hardware config properties it looks up for\n    glance images. Thus the new syntax for setting custom\n    hardware properties is\n    \n          # glance image-update \\\n                   --property hw_disk_bus=ide \\\n                   --property hw_cdrom_bus=ide \\\n                   --property hw_vif_model=e1000 \\\n                   f16-x86_64-openstack-sda\n    \n    There is no back-compat support for the previous 'disk_bus',\n    'cdrom_bus' and 'vif_model' names, since they were never\n    made available in any formal release, only development\n    snapshots.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Blueprint: libvirt-custom-hardware\n    Fixes bug 1132739\n    Change-Id: Ic15ef0eba065113b35bbb2713be2532c858c3534\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.
