In master, the instance_id field of volume_usage_cache is currently an integer, but the value passed to the function db.sqlalchemy.api.vol_usage_update() is a uuid. The value stored in volume_usage_cache is therefore corrupt, so no usable billing records for volume usage can be generated.\n\nThis means that any customer who needs to generate billing records based on volume usage will not be able to upgrade from folsum until this code has been merged.",
