    "description": "When using _setup_logging_from_flags (e.g. if you use devstack) - you can't see anything that might get logged from other modules (e.g. keystone.middleware.auth_token).  I would imagine this same issue also prevents logging form other modules that nova uses (e.g. sqlalchemy , eventlet).\n\nI'm not sure the pressures that moved things to the current implementation, but the \"root\" (heh) of the issue seems to be that nova.log._setup_logging_from_flags only adds handlers to the \"nova\" logger (look at the default name kwarg for the local definition of getLogger) and goes out of it's way to remove any handlers that were added to the root logger.\n\nOne fix would be to configure the handlers on the real root logger instead of nova_root, and let modules that are expecting logging to be setup by the app take advantage of a properly configured root logger instead of blasting their messages into NullHandler.\n\nFWIW, if you use a log_config that does the right thing with a properly configured root logger it basically works like you'd expect.\n\nAlso it seems like at least in sqlalchemy's case it does some fancy stuff to add stream handler's all over the place if you set echo=True in engine_create.  So the keystone middleware thing is the best example I have of this actually being a problem.",
