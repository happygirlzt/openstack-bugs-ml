    "description": "Baremetal PXE driver deactivate_bootloader() is failing to delete tftp images when driver.destroy() is called. This results in a non-empty /tftpboot/{instance-uuid}/ directory being left behind on the compute node after an instance is deleted.\n\nI believe this happens because the instance parameter passed to driver.destroy() does not contain ['extra_specs']['deploy_kernel_id'] or ['extra_specs']['deploy_ramdisk_id']. These these were passed to driver.spawn(), so I had assumed they were passed to driver.destroy() as well. This can be confirmed by logging the exception within the first try: block of deactivate_bootloader().\n\nOne solution is to pass extra_specs to driver.destroy().\nAnother solution is for deactivate_bootloader() to blindly delete all files under the /tftpboot/{instance-uuid}/ directory.",

This\n    happened partly because of dangling files within the directory, and\n    partly because 'unlink' does not remove directories and the error was\n    squelched.\n    \n    Now, when destroy()ing an instance, PXE driver will call shutil.rmtree()\n    on the per-instance directories which it created.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1101048.\n    \n    Change-Id: I682d0264288add488ea23e5d5200357b7be52dd9\n",
