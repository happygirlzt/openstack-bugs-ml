The way the code is implemented, it would be easy to return a list of \"servers\" each of which would be a \"server\" dict instead of just a single \"server\" dict.  The problem with this approach is that it breaks the API as there would no longer be an item in the response dictionary named \"server\".  \n\nAs a very rough example:\n\nCurrent: {server: server_dict1}\n\nWith this approach: {servers:[server_dict1, server_dict2]}\n\nDoes this need to wait for v3 and we just use the reservation_id filter for now?",
