    "description": "When an instance with a volume attached is brought into a rescue mode and a negative test is run against it to detach the volume it returns the expected error code. However if you attempt to detach the volume again after unrescuing the vm it will not detach properly. The volume state goes from detaching to in-use, and it is never detached.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a server and wait for it to get to ACTIVE state\n2. Create a volume and wait for it to get to AVAILABLE state\n3. Attach the volume to the server and wait for the volume to get to \"IN USE\" state\n4. Rescue the VM and wait for the VM to get to the \"RESCUE\" state\n5. Detach the volume from the server, which should fail with 409\n6. Unrescue the VM and wait for it to get to ACTIVE state\n7. Try to detach the volume from the Volume again from the server\n\nWatching the status of the volume it will go from detaching to in-use and remain there.",
