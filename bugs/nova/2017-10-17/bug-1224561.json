This means:\n    * need to manually add them to the destination host\n    * need to manually clean them on source host\n    \n    Adding the images is fairly straightforward by calling\n    create_kernel_and_ramdisk at post_live_migration_at_destination.\n    Removing images requires us to cache image ids as they are\n    taken from VM record which is deleted by the time the post\n    operation comes along.  We use the migrate_data to cache the\n    image data for removal.\n    \n    The unit tests are adjusted to handle new calls for existing\n    tests.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1224561\n    \n    Change-Id: I741398db9ddb6764408878a11cf4c80544bbc901\n",
