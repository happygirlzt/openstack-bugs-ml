However the second notification,\n    compute.exception, only emited after the instance is put into ERROR state.\n    This makes the test unstable.\n    \n    This patch makes the test stable by waiting for the compute.exception\n    notification to arrive before asserting the received notifications.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia5311ffc12784987c138b127e43cfc52019cb3ea\n    Closes-Bug: #1717917\n",

Looking back\n    to the origin patch the problem is obvious and embarrassing. The extra\n    _wait_for_notification call was introduced _after_ the assert that checks\n    the number of received notifications. So the original patch never worked.\n    \n    This patch moves the extra wait call _before_ the assert.\n    \n    [1] http://logs.openstack.org/55/483955/9/check/gate-nova-tox-functional-ubuntu-xenial/209d046/console.html#_2017-10-04_21_52_53_807624\n    \n    Change-Id: I4c104842cbde587dc9c67f5fde84140252cdcdb5\n    Closes-Bug: #1717917\n",
