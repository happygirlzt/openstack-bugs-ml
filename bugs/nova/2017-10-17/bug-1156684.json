    "description": "While looking at the tests in nova/tests/integrated/test_api_samples.py, I noticed that many of them are missing the tests to validate the response code after invoking the REST API.\n\nMy suggestion to this problem is to change _verify_response to:\na) include a check for the return code.\nb) take an extra parm (having default value=200) for the return code which for now is only needed for those cases where we still have inconsistency in the those APIs returning 202 instead of 200.\nOnce we fix those APIs, that parm should be taken out and the method should always check for 200 as the return code.\n\nBy doing this we add the following benefits:\n1) Developers writing sample tests don't have to make the call to Assert for the right response code anymore (often forgotten).\n2) _verify_response is called in each test to verify the response. By having the test in the fcn, we guarantee the check is always done.\n\nLater, we could add a trap to make sure no new API is passing the return code to the fcn. Instead, always assume the error code is 200 as it should be.",
