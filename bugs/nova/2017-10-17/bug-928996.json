The pool now gets\n    passed into nova.rpc.amqp using arguments as needed.\n    \n    The previous method worked fine unless both rpc implementations got\n    loaded into the same Python instance.  In that case, whichever one got\n    loaded 2nd had control over what type of connections nova.rpc.amqp would\n    create.  With these changes in place, this conflict between impl_kombu\n    and impl_qpid is resolved.\n    \n    Change-Id: I72bc0c95bfc04ccdfb89d3456332f622ca5ffa42\n",
