This would be discernable with an additional state change between BUILDING and DEPLOYING.\n\nDetails\n=====\n\nDuring a baremetal deployment, the state is tracked in the nova_bm.bm_nodes table. The state is set to BUILDING when virt/driver/baremetal.py:driver.spawn() acquires the node and begins preparing the deployment. After the power_driver's activate_node() method is called, the PXE driver goes into a wait loop to see when the deployment is done. The state is changed to DEPLOYING when baremetal-deploy-helper receives a connection from the deployment ramdisk, and then either set to DEPLOYDONE or DEPLOYFAIL, accordingly.\n\nThere is a middle step which is not currently represented. If the baremetal node powers on but never connects to the deploy-helper, it is impossible to tell from the database whether the deploy environment was not created or whether the machine is dead.\n\nProposed fix\n==========\n\nAdd a PREPARED state to baremetal_states.py, and set the node to this state immediately after calling activate_node().",
