This\n    will break as soon as the right hand side of the version chnages\n    from one digit to two. A float of 1.1 and 1.10 is the same. A\n    version string of '1.1' and '1.10' is not.\n    \n    This patch changes the internals of version handling to always use\n    Version objects which represent the versions using a name tuple\n    (major=1, minor=10). It also changes the externals to expect versions\n    as strings ('1.10'). Where floats were present before, these have\n    been changed to strings. Where tuples have been accepted, these are\n    still accepted, but strings are as well.\n    \n    This is an internal only change, users shouldn't notice any\n    difference as their versions (in the openstack-api-version header)\n    were always strings and we haven't made it to version 1.10, sorry\n    '1.10', yet.\n    \n    If developers try to version_handler with something other than a\n    version string, test runs will fail very early (at import time).\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic2b655ac4c75c6104eddecd174f193413a0764d2\n    Closes-Bug: #1675143\n",
