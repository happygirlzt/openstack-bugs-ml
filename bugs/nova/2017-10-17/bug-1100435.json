    "description": "We noticed that when floating IP addresses were being assigned to instances, the L3 driver binds the IP to the kvmhost\u2019s public interface first, and then setup the NAT rules.  This gives a window of opportunity for traffic for floating IP to go to the kvmhost instead of the instance.  I traced the issue to nova/network/l3.py, add_floating_ip method:\n\nOriginal:\n    def add_floating_ip(self, floating_ip, fixed_ip, l3_interface_id):\n        linux_net.bind_floating_ip(floating_ip, l3_interface_id)\n        linux_net.ensure_floating_forward(floating_ip, fixed_ip)\n\nModified:\n    def add_floating_ip(self, floating_ip, fixed_ip, l3_interface_id):\n        linux_net.ensure_floating_forward(floating_ip, fixed_ip)\n        linux_net.bind_floating_ip(floating_ip, l3_interface_id)\n\n\nI think setting up the NAT rules first then binding the IP should be okay.  I tested and it seems to work.",
