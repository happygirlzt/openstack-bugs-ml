    "description": "When nova does an rpc.call/multicall, it generates a unique queue for a response and waits forever to receive this response.\n\nIf the daemon that consumed the 'call' request is restarted in the middle of processing the request (post-ACKing the amqp message), the processing of the request would be killed and not restarted upon daemon restart.  This means that it would never put a message in the response queue for the caller.  This leaves the initial caller waiting forever, blocking a greenthread and holding an RPC connection out of the pool.",
