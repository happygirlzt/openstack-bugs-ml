    "description": "I have a large number of snapshots created from a volume. These are COW snapshots so the actual disk space they take is not large, but when I try to delete them using the OSAPI, it takes a very long time to delete each one of them. The volumes and snapshots are based on LVM.\n\nLooking at the code, nova-volumes clears the volume/snapshots using \"dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/<vol-name>\", which is what takes a long time for large volumes/snapshots. This should be done in a lazy fashion (as mentioned in a TODO comment in the code).",
