However, in the nova repository, the example keystone authentication info is still in api-paste.ini instead of nova.conf.sample.\n\nIt is easier on operators if only the nova.conf file needs to be edited, and seeing the content in etc/nova/api-paste.ini can be\nconfusing.\n\nI recommend moving the content from api-paste.ini to nova.conf.sample.\n\nNote that this requires modifying devstack since removing these lines from api-paste.ini will cause devstack to fail, and it's used to gate nova.",
