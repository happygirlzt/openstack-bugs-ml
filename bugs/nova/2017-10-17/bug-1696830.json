From what I can tell, the placement api config doesn't actually make its way through from the placement wsgi script to keystonemiddleware via OS_PLACEMENT_CONFIG_DIR or via my attempt to fix above by passing sys.argv. While setting debug=true makes it look like the config gets applied, it doesn't actually get passed along.\n\nSee nova/api/openstack/placement/deploy.py:\n\n# Do not provide global conf to middleware here.\n        auth_middleware = auth_token.filter_factory(\n            {}, oslo_config_project=project_name)\n\nI think that results in the ConfigOpts class of oslo_config having to call find_config_files() and find_config_dirs() which will search standard config locations (~/.nova, ~/, /etc/nova, /etc) for config.\n\nFor the nova snap package, the config will either be in /snap/nova/current/etc/nova/ or /var/snap/nova/common/etc/nova, neither of which would be in oslo_config's standard search paths.\n\nIt seems that this should be fixed in nova, but oslo_config could also be updated to be a bit more flexible in their standard search paths, perhaps with snap package directories or via environment variables.",

The wsgi application doesn't accept\n    CLI arguments, so we can't pass --config-file, --config-dir, or\n    --log-file via uwsgi's pyargv. Additionally, nova-placement-api doesn't\n    pass the [keystone_authtoken] from the config file found in\n    OS_PLACEMENT_CONFIG_DIR to keystonemiddleware.\n    \n    We continue to use the OS_PLACEMENT_CONFIG_DIR environment variable to\n    point at the default nova.conf in $SNAP/etc/nova.conf. This default\n    nova.conf includes logdir=$SNAP_COMMON/log/, enabling nova-placement-api.log\n    to be written to the correct directory.\n    \n    Passing [keystone_authtoken] to keystonemiddleware is fixed in oslo.config.\n    The prior commit titled \"Patch (_COMMON) dirs into oslo.config defaults\"\n    includes a patch for this. keystonemiddleware gets the [keystone_authtoken]\n    config via oslo.config's find_config_files() and find_config_dirs(), which\n    are patched to include the $SNAP and $SNAP_COMMON config directories.\n    \n    Change-Id: I02e2a5d9df91eb8cbf36beb474809bc1e80fe80b\n    Closes-Bug: 1696830\n",
