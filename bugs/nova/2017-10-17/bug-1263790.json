    "description": "If the BMC / IPMI credentials being used for management of hardware were only granted OPERATOR privileges, there is no way to inform Nova's baremetal driver or Ironic's ipmitool driver to use this non-default privilege level. These will issue ipmitool commands with no \"-L\" parameter, resulting in privilege errors, because the default ipmitool privlvl is ADMINISTRATOR.\n\nThis could be fixed by adding an optional field to store the privilege level.",
