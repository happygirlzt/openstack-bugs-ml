If the project has a lot of ports, the\n    list call to neutron can be slow, so we should optimize this method as\n    much as possible. One way to do that is rather than get the port details\n    back, we just get the id since all we care about is the number of ports\n    assigned to the project.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1521788\n    \n    Change-Id: Icddba161112526dde23184ee80ad5cb60fe66cc6\n",
