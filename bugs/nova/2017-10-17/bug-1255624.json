This is usually a result of QEMU crashing, or being killed. I've never seen this happen in response to a virDomainSuspend API call.\n\nTo further diagnose this you need to examine more logs, in particular /var/log/libvirt/qemu/$GUESTNAME.log - if we're lucky (we're usually not) then this may indicate why QEMU crashed. Also check /var/log/messages for stupid things like the OOM killer going mental & slaughtering QEMU.",
