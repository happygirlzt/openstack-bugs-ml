Verify that the correct device/LUN is removed (instead of wrong one).\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\nThe regression potential is small as it has run in newer versions of nova for awhile now (since Juno, the release immediately following Icehouse). If a regression were to occur it would likely prevent a live migration from completing (failing in the post processing), leaving the instance in an error state. However, it should be migrated to the target hypervisor with access to the LUN so it would require manual cleanup of the lun at the source hypervisor and a reset of the instance state to active.",
