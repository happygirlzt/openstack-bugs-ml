    "description": "Using SQLAlchemy + Postgres will result in your APIs only handling 1 SQL request at a time. Since most requests are SQL-based this could have a negative impact on customer experience.\n\nThere is a branch in which fixes the issue for MySQL but I was unable to do the same for Postgres due to my limited knowledge of Postgres and the fact that there is an issue with the current Ubuntu psycopg2 package which is causing errors. More likely than not this will be resolved when psycopg2 is upgraded on Ubuntu and we can solve this concurrency problem for Postgres.\n\nRelated MySQL branch: https://code.launchpad.net/~rackspace-titan/nova/sqlalchemy-eventlet/+merge/71087",
