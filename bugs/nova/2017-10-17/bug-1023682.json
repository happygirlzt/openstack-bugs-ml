Currently VM state is updated to ACTIVE no matter\n    what during snapshot. But VM should remain STOPPED if a snapshot\n    is taken on a stopped VM, i.e. remain unchanged.\n    \n    VM state should not be changed during snapshot.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5578e6064e23a8ff6f4019116b5bcdd12529360c\n",
