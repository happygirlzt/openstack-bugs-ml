We have two api calls to do the same thing both set-metadata and update will manipulate the aggregate metadata. \n\nAdding/updating availability zone ends up setting metadata then we should  use update_aggregate_metadata instead of update_aggregate. I guess we are just replacing the existing metadata to enforce the uniqueness of availability zone for an aggregate. \n\nSet metadata for aggregates will be added to the dashboard so I think before exposing the functionality to the end users we should figure this out",
