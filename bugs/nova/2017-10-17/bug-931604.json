Albeit this is fine in most cases there are problems when: i) nova-compute domU is talking to xapi using the internal management network (e.g. talking to xapi via 169.254.0.1) and traffic cannot be routed between domU and dom0; ii) in resource pools, the host address from the xenapi session handle is always the master, which could get overloaded if there are too many requests.\n\n- get_rrd and get_rrd_updates could politely log the IOError exceptions.\n\nI propose to use FLAGS.xenapi_connection_url instead. By using this flag we have the following benefits:\n\n- we transparently use the appropriate scheme and server (regardless of whether the host is in a pool or not).\n- it is quicker (we don't need to call xapi to get the address)",
