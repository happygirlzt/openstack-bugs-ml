This would have to probably be resolved as a blueprint, it might even require a microversion to signal the change, so a spec would be needed for newton.\n\nBut since you can attach/detach vifs with the nova API using neutron as the backend, I think you should be able to list them also.\n\nNova does have a 'no more API proxy' policy, but I think that really only applies to new APIs, I think we need to have API parity with nova-network and neutron if we're striving for interop.",
