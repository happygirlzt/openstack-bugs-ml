This access was erroneously removed during the large patch\n    series to land the driver in Nova. The corresponding change did not land\n    in Ironic, because it fails to pass tempest (as does the current Ironic\n    driver in Nova).\n    \n    This patch reverts that change.\n    \n    Change-Id: I525c611aa0e98076477c2a9a279a0f8a47858aac\n    Closes-bug: 1367007\n",
