Mitchell <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 27 18:49:05 2012 -0500\n\n    Fix state logic for auto-confirm resizes\n    \n    In the compute manager, the _poll_unconfirmed_resizes() periodic\n    task mishandled state checks, and would call confirm_resize() in\n    invalid states.  This patch fixes the logic so that confirm_resize()\n    is only called if the instance is in vm_state 'resized' and\n    task_state None.  The unit test is also fixed for the proper logic.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1030175.\n    \n    Change-Id: I66028b7042d88fb0f1f41df07f42b4b02cf60247\n",
