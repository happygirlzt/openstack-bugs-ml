In this case, the default MTU size of 1500 bytes is not working due to the overhead of VxLAN header size.\n\nHere is an example of the problem.\n\nVM A runs on host B and VM C runs on host D. Each VM has a VxLAN-based private network interface. VM A has its own floating IP as well.\n\nFrom a laptop, a user logins to VM A via its floating IP. And then, when s/he logins from VM A to VM B using the private IP of VM B, it fails due to the VxLAN overhead when MTU is 1500 bytes. \n\nOnly after manually increasing the MTU size of the tap interfaces of VM A and VM B to a jumbo frame, it is possible to login from VM A to VM B via their private IPs.\n\nI think this is a serious bug.",
