That is pointed out\n    by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/34821/. And it didn't get any\n    object from mail-list:\n    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-November/020291.html\n    \n    This patch remove ratelimit middleware and limits extension. The config option\n    'api_rate_limit' is only valid in v2 api. The pipeline factory for v3 api won't\n    check that option anymore. For compatibility, if user is still using old\n    'api-paste.init', pipeline factory will ignore to load ratelimit middleware, and\n    print warning message to user for notice ratelimit is deprecated in v3 api.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1255471\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifeae0504e11089f95e4d8af58bcb7372dca87f81\n",
