    "description": "The XenAPI host aggregates support is currently unable to deal with the case when the pool master dies.\n\nThe master re-election should be left to the administrator (unless we are able to leverage XenServer HA), because it is hard in general to tell if the master is truly dead, or there was just a loss of management network connectively. It is tricky to ensure the master does not write the VM disk during the process.\n\nThe best approach is to ensure to find out which memeber of the aggregate has become the master, in the case where the master is changed.\n\nThis is important because all VM operations are sent to the master of the pool (such as VM start and stop)\n\nPools were added in Essex, and this issue was not address in the initial implementation.",
