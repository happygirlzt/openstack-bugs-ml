            "content": "Afaik the scheduler is pretty opaque to an api user. I'm looking for a\nmechanism to discover what architecture a given openstack instance supports\nusing its api. While i agree with the comments in that thread that a\ncompatible flavor and image combination are required to make it work, i\ndisagree that this is soley the property of the image, as that leaves zero\nability to introspect the system capabilities as an api user. ie its\n possible to have an arm compatible image with no applicable hardware. The\nflavor/instance-type level introspection seems the most appropriate to\nallow for an api user to distinguish hardware.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 17, 2012 at 2:43 PM, Russell Bryant\n<email address hidden>wrote:\n\n> I believe your use case is already covered using the filter scheduler.\n> A good thread to read would be:\n>\n> http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-\n> dev/2012-August/000691.html\n>\n> Is there something missing here that you need?\n>\n> ** Changed in: nova\n>        Status: New => Incomplete\n>\n> --\n> You received this bug notification because you are subscribed to the bug\n> report.\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1028688\n>\n> Title:\n>   flavor details should include arch\n>\n> To manage notifications about this bug go to:\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1028688/+subscriptions\n>\n",
