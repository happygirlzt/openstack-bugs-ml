    "description": "When Nova attaches a volume to an instance the volume DB state will transition\nfrom \"available\" to directly \"in-use\", if successful. There is no  any\nintermediate sate.\n\nBecause of the asynchronous nature of the attach code path, the volume DB state \nwill remain in the available state under the following conditions:\n\n1) The attach takes a long time (for whatever reason)\n2) The attach fails, due for instance, the device path specified being already\nin use. \n\nThe disconnect  caused by the successful API return and the asynchronous volume\ncode execution is confusing for users. This is especially so  in the error case  \nwhere the API call returns successfully the user sees no error but the volume \ndoes not get attached.\n\nI would like to suggest that we change the volume DB state to \"attaching\" in\nthe API before returning to the user and to \"in-use\"  on successful completion \nOn error the volume DB state would be set back to \"available\". This allows \ndifferentiation between 1) and 2) above.\n\nWe could enhance this by adding a  \u201clast volumes return code\u201d column to the DB.\nThis could be used to record the asynchronous return from the Volumes driver.\nSo in the case of a failure to attach, the Volume DB state would revert to\n\u201cavailable\u201d and the \u201clast volumes return code\u201d could indicate \u201cpath already in\nuse\u201d\n\nI intend to add a patch for this proposal in a subsequent update to the bug.",
