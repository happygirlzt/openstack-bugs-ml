    "description": "The HTTP return codes you get when you actually hit a quota limit are a weird mix. I get a 500 level error code when I hit a RAM limit (the one you are adding this this merge prop). Just for fun I tried another one for the personality limit and I got an HTTP 400 error code. Looking at the SPEC again it looks like we should actually be returning a HTTP 413 'overLimit' error code.",

The tests for the instance and image metadata and personality items have been changed and should provide validation for the fix. I plan to look at that tomorrow. ",
