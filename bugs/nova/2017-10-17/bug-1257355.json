For raw images, the virt_disk_size\n    is set to disk_size to ensure that virt_disk_size is always the\n    size of the disk that should be re-created.\n    \n    Update unit tests to be more strict and check for sizes to be correct.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1257355\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie3be46024f06b9f59af92f5e3918a1958386d4f1\n",
