This is common on systems which have /tmp partitioned separately so that it can be mounted with noexec and nosuid for security reasons.\n\nI've attached a patch to add a --tempdir flag to nova, which will allow for overriding the default to explicitly set the temp directory.",

I would hesitate to use that method as a systems administrator. I would be worried about what unintended consequences i would end up with by taking this route.. as the expected behavior for the rest of the system is to utilize /tmp for temp dirs/files..  \n\nGiven that this function in nova can have huge space ramifications, the sane (from an ops perspective) approach is not to modify the global environment variables, but allow for fine grained administrator control by providing a configuration option.",
