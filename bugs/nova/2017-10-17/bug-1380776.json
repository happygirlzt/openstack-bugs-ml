    "description": "Encountered a situation where one glance node could not talk to registry which resulted in a high number of upload_vhd errors. The Glance XenAPI plugin doesn't properly differentiate between server permanent and globally permanent errors. This is only reasonable behavior in the case where there is a single glance node. In the case of many glance nodes retrying a different server is preferable.\n\nIdeally:\n\nRetry until:\n1. A non-retryable error is encountered (e.g. 403)\n2. Max retries is reached\n3. No servers left to retry (i.e. every server was dropped from the retry list due to a permanent error)\n\nIf the glance nodes sit behind a load balancer (proxy), this approach could result in the LB being treated as a single glance endpoint (no retries for server errors). Retrying on server errors without dropping servers with server errors from the list could result in unnecessary retries, especially in the case where there is only a single glance node.\n\n\nAdditionally, if multiple errors are encountered, only the last error is logged as an instance error. Every error should be recorded.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nCurrent:\n\n* The plugin tries to upload using 1 of n glance nodes (n > 1)\n* An ephemeral (retryable) error is encountered\n* The plugin retries using a different glance node\n* An error related to a server fault (e.g. 500) is encountered\n* The plugin does not retry\n* Instance fault\n\nExpected:\n\n* The plugin tries to upload using 1 of n glance nodes (n > 1)\n* An ephemeral (retryable) error is encountered\n* Instance fault\n* The plugin retries using a different glance node\n* An error related to a server fault (e.g. 500) is encountered\n* The plugin retries using a different glance node\n* Success",

Cook <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 13 14:08:52 2014 -0500\n\n    update retryable errors & instance fault on retry\n    \n    HTTP errors can be split into a few categories: client ephemeral, server\n    ephemeral, server permanent, and globally permanent. You could argue\n    there is even more permutations. However, for simplicity, these errors\n    can be viewed as ephemeral and permanent.\n    \n    The Glance XenAPI plugin has been updated to raise a RetryableError for\n    ephemeral and unexpected (i.e. errors that are categorized as neither\n    permanent or ephemeral) errors.\n    \n    Additionally, an instance fault will be logged every time an error\n    occurs. This will serve as transaction history where every attempt is a\n    transaction on the state. If an ephemeral error occurs, there is a\n    retry, then a permanent error, the history of each error will be in the\n    instance_faults.\n    \n    Deployers should configure the num_retries relative to the number of\n    api_servers. Right now, servers are put in random order and then cycled.\n    Trying the same server multiple times could cause unnecessary load and\n    delays. However, trying multiple servers, is ideal when a single server\n    is behaving badly or cannot reach another server it needs to communicate\n    with to fulfill a request.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1380776\n    \n    Change-Id: I267a5b524c3ff8a28edf1a2285b77bb09049773c\n",
