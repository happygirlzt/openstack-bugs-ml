If new request is sent then it remains in rabbitmq.\n\nWhen nova-scheduler is up again then it picks all requests from rabbitmq for processing.\n\nNote:\nIf user sends sigterm signal to nova-scheduler then parent process waits until current request is completed.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. scheduler should complete current request before exiting - Not Good\n2. scheduler should not accept new request for processing - Good",
