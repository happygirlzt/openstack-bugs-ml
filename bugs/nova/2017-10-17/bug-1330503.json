    "description": "During compute manager startup init_host is called. One of the functions there is to delete instance data that doesn't belong to this host i.e. _destroy_evacuated_instances. But this function only checks if the local instance belongs to the host or not. It doesn't check the task_state or vm_state.\n\nIf at this time a resize migration is taking place and the destination compute manager is restarted it might destroy the resizing instance. Alternatively, if the resize has completed (vm_state = RESIZED) but has not been confirmed/reverted, then a restart of the source compute manager might destroy the original instance.\n\nA similar bug concerning just the migrating state is outlined here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1319797 and a fix is proposed here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/93903\n\nIt was intended to have that fix deal with resize migrating instances as well as those just in the migrating state but as pointed out in a review comment this solution will work for migrating but a fix for resize would require further changes so I have raised this bug to highlight that.",

One of the\n    functions there is to delete instance data that doesn't belong\n    to this host i.e. _destroy_evacuated_instances.\n    But this function only checks if the local instance belongs to\n    the host or not. It doesn't check the task_state or vm_state.\n    \n    In Resize function, user may want to revert or confirm the resize\n    operations so the instance on source and dest compute node should\n    be kept. so for RESIZE_MIGRATING, RESIZE_MIGRATED task states and\n    RESIZED vm state instances, they should be kept in compute node\n    when the compute restart. This patch adds check for the task\n    state and vm state before delete the instances.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1330503\n    \n    Change-Id: I723fa4a8823019391ea83aa189096531032adab1\n",
