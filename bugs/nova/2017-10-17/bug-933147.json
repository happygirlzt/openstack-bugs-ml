Both of these APIs notify nova compute via three methods:\n\ndef trigger_security_group_rules_refresh(self, context, security_group_id,\ndef trigger_security_group_members_refresh(self, context, group_ids,\ndef trigger_provider_fw_rules_refresh(self, context):\n\nThese indicate that the security group tables in the database have been modified so that nova can take appropriate action. Currently, quantum is not notified of these changes. A lightweight mechanism is required to ensure quantum is able to receive this notifications.",
