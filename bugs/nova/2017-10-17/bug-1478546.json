            "content": "@Divya K Konoor (dikonoor):\n\nThis sounds more like a change request than an actual bug. Change requests are done via \"blueprints\" in Launchpad [1] and their design get reviewed in \"spec files\" in Gerrit [2]. The process is described in [3]. The current \"Liberty\" cycle has reached \"feature freeze\" [4], this means you can propose this change for the next \"Mitaka\" release and use [5] for that. Since I consider this not a bug, I close it and ask you do create a blueprint. Maybe Arun Mani can help you with the implementation of the blueprint.\n\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova\n[2] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints\n[4] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Liberty_Release_Schedule#Feature_Freeze\n[5] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova-specs/tree/specs/mitaka-template.rst",
