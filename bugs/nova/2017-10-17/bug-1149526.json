M. Rodrigues <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Mar 7 13:25:09 2013 -0500\n\n    Add MultipleCreate template and fix conflict with other templates\n    \n    This patch creates a dedicated xml template to the os-multiple-create extension\n    when using return_reservation_id=True in the request. The previous code, with\n    all extensions loaded, conflicted with security_groups extension.\n    \n    There is also a change in the response due to the new Template, but the only\n    information removed is an empty metadata field (which made the previous xml\n    output even more inconsisten with json). The consistency between json and xml\n    will be treated in the next api version.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Fixes bug 1149526\n    \n    Change-Id: I3ca0129086ff1df3a8faa2b3b8bd959c9b74103c\n",
