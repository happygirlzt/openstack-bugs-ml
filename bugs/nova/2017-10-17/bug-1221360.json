This prevents the strict\n    typechecking from doing it's job, and differs from every other object\n    model currently in the tree. As a result, non-nullable attributes such\n    as dev_type are string-converted to \"None\" in the object, which is\n    definitely not the intent.\n    \n    This is convention, not something we test for, but it was wrong, and\n    ended up breaking the next patch which introduces a scenario where this\n    gets checked in the unit tests more strictly. Thus, the test is in the\n    next aptch\n    \n    Change-Id: Id6e1f444ceae13ee9fa1a9518db5a239a1d9fbe3\n    Closes-bug: 1221360\n",
