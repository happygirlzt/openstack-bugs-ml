    "description": "Server create will only process \"networks\" if the os-networks extension is loaded.   \n\nWhen working with a quantum configuration and multiple networks you have to be able to pass in the requested network to avoid instances being attached to all networks, so this part of the request isn't really optional\n\nHowever the os-network extension is not fully compatible with quantum, and the operations do map very well.  For example:\n\n- Network creation has a set of options that are pretty nova-net centric (such as VLAN)\n- Network creation is limited to admins\n- Network association and dis-association from projects is not the quanum model\n- cidr from quantum is not shown correctly in the output of nova network-list and network-show\n\n\nRather than needing os-networks loaded and thereby exposing a bunch of calls that don't really map to quantum, it would be better to also allow processing of \"networks\" when the network api is configured to be quantum",
