I think pointing at Jenkins dashboard where the tests are tracked would be good enough, as long as the names of the jobs are synced.\n\nThe most important piece of information on this page is the pointer to the unit test job, though.  That needs to be named correctly and perhaps it can point to a page that documents how to do unit testing.  It looks like there may be a full on testing project soon that would most likely own this sort of information.",
