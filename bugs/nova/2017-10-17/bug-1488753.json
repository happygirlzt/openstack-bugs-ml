    "description": "Similar to bug 828357 (against libvirt), we should label the FileSystems for ephemeral and root device which running on XenServer too. With a meaningful label, it's easier to get the device's type and allow you to easily add entries to fstab just as what is mentioned in bug 828357.\n\nThe suggestion is as the following:\n1. if it uses the glance image to build-up root device, we give it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a label of \"cloudimg-rootfsn\" to each partition(the last n is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the partition number: e.g. cloudimg-rootfs1 for /dev/xvda1);\n2. set the label as \"ephemeral\" for the first ephemeral device;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there are additional ephemerals, the label will be\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"ephemeraln\" where the last n is the sequence number starts\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from 1 (e.g.: \"ephemeral\" for the first one, \"ephemeral1\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for the 2nd one; and \"ephemeral2\" for the 3rd one...)",
