While this is unavoidable for\n    the current implementation of resize across multiple hosts, if there\n    is a single host (i.e. a test scenario) or the resize is restricted\n    to the same host then we can succeed without SSH access\n    \n    Dependency on Ia310e31d31aaf5c979e41c64af8223202a18e03a is because the\n    tests will always fail without Ia310 therefore this fix cannot be tested\n    without taking Ia310 as well.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1308064\n    \n    Change-Id: I15802a1d97d380b1c5b74fc9f92ece2494fe789a\n",
