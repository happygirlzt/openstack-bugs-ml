Nevertheless a subsequent attach of the same volume again will fail. So:\n\n% nova volume-attach my_instance c54ad11f-4e51-41a0-97db-7e551776db59 /dev/sdb\n\nfails with the error that the volume's vmdk file is not found.\n\nCause:\n\nDuring volume detach a delete_virtual_disk_spec is used to remove the device from the running instance. This spec also \"destroy\"s the underlying vmdk file. The offending line is : https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/vmwareapi/vm_util.py#L471\n\nPossible fix:\nThe fileOperation field of the device config during this reconfigure operation should be left unset. We should continue setting device_config.operation field to \"remove\". This will remove the device from the VM without deleting the underlying vmdk backing.",
