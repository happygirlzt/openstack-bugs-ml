Now, nova-baremetal-deploy-helper updates the\n    bm_nodes record directly when it begins and finishes deploying an image\n    to that node.\n    \n    The next patch will add a LoopingCall inside driver.spawn() to wait for\n    the deploy to complete.\n    \n    Also, since there can not be >1 active deployment per node, there\n    is no need to have a separate table for storing them. This patch drops\n    the table bm_deployments and adds the important information it contained\n    to bm_nodes. Since the previous behavior was to mark a deployment as\n    deleted once it completed, there is no need to copy any data from\n    bm_deployments prior to dropping the table -- assuming that no active\n    deployments are in process when the migration is run.\n    \n    Since this is the first migration for the baremetal database, it also\n    adds a new test class, TestBaremetalMigrations, and refactors the\n    test_migrations.py file to allow for multiple test classes.\n    \n    partially implements fix for bug 1096723\n    \n    Change-Id: Iad30b462d49c88fc19babed43a2fb8540b1fad30\n",

This would raise an InstanceNotFound exception for\n    deleted instances. This prevented ComputeManager from ever detecting\n    a running-but-deleted baremetal instance, and could leave baremetal\n    instances in an undeletable state.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1096723.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifae532e8e70e97e48c589608cb3c7000bb6a7609\n",
