It is 'access_ip_v4'\n    and 'access_ip_v6' in DB.\n    This makes  'access_ip_v4' and 'access_ip_v6' filter stop working.\n    \n    The schema should be fixed accordingly to allow the 'access_ip_v4'\n    and 'access_ip_v6' as valid filter.\n    \n    'accessIPv4' and 'accessIPv6' are something the API accepts\n    and returns and internally API layer translate those param\n    to their respective field('access_ip_v4' and 'access_ip_v6')\n    present in DB.\n    So user does not know anything about 'access_ip_v4' and\n    'access_ip_v6'. They are not in API representation actually.\n    \n    Later list filter and sort param should be same as field return\n    in GET or accepted in POST/PUT which are 'accessIPv4' and 'accessIPv6'.\n    But that is something new attribute support in filter and can be\n    done later after more discussion.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idc12de0062d298259e25c8b4c0dde889054a9ae5\n    Closes-Bug: #1661195\n",
