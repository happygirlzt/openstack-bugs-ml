    "description": "[Impact]\nAlthough aarch64 supports spawning a vm with hugepages, in nova code, the libvirt driver considers only x86_64 and I686. Both for NUMA and Hugepage support, AARCH64 needs to be added. Due to this bug, vm can not be launched with hugepage using OpenStack on aarch64 servers.\n\nNote: this depends on the fix for LP: #1627926.\n\n[Test Case]\nSteps to reproduce:\nOn an openstack environment running on aarch64:\n1. Configure compute to use hugepages.\n2. Set mem_page_size=\"2048\" for a flavor\n3. Launch a VM using the above flavor.\n\nExpected result:\nVM should be launched with hugepages and the libvirt xml should have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0<memoryBacking>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<hugepages>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<page size='2048' unit='KiB' nodeset='0'/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</hugepages>\n\u00a0\u00a0</memoryBacking>\n\nActual result:\nVM is launched without hugepages.\n\nThere are no error logs in nova-scheduler.\n\n[Regression Risk]\nRisk is minimized by the fact that this change is just enabling the same code for arm64 that is already enabled for Ubuntu/x86.",

So instead of a BP, it'll be good to fix it as a bug. The minimum version of libvert(1.2.7) and QEMU(2.1.0) which are verified for x86 also hold good for aarch64. Please let me know if I can proceed with fixing it as a bug. ",
