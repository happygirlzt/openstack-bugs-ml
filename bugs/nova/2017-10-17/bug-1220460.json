Being able to enable/disable a cell also would help in troubleshooting or maintenance. As far as I know there is no way to set a cell to enabled or disabled, or even further to use scheduler hints to override this to send builds to a cell.",

Example cases: troubleshooting an issue affecting only one cell or running low / out of available IPs in the cell (where any new build would fail). The weighting system has not been working well because even with a low negative weighting, a build may still land in the cell we want to disable.\n\nI would like to implement this feature in nova, but would like input on the new database column name.\n\nI thought about using \"disabled\" as we're using with computes, but what exactly would \"disabled\" mean to the community? Would it only prevent new builds? Disable all actions? Something in between?\n\nI have also though about using \"disabled_for_builds\" which would be much more descriptive about what is being disabled -- only new builds.\n",
