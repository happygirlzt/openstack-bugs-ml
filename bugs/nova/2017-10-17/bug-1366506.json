You should\n    not modify the virtual machine directly. Use the management console of\n    the solution to make changes. Do you want to proceed?\"\n    \n    The extension will be called 'org.openstack.compute'. This will make use\n    of a type called 'instance'.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1366506\n    \n    Change-Id: I1046576c448704841ae8e1800b8390e947b0d457\n",
