    "description": "This bug only affects compute workers using the XenServer hypervisor.\n\nIf a XenServer's Dom0 disk fills up, the compute worker's call to XenServerSession login will hang. This will cause the compute worker service to not start. This will, in turn, cause messages to accumulate on the worker's queue, making it wrongly appear to be a problem in the RPC code-path (Rabbit, carrot, etc).\n\nProposed fix:\n\nWe should be able to detect the login hanging, time it out, and then log an error message on the compute worker. Perhaps something like:\n\n\"Unable to login using XenServerSession (is the disk full?)\"",
