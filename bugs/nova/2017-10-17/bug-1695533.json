    "description": "I launched an instance using Devstack running on QEMU hypervisor. I dumped the XML of VM to see what things are getting configured and found a URL in the XML. The URL points to a page which no longer exists on the openstack.org website. I guess this URL gets embedded in each VM's XML. Though it does nothing (maybe pointing to the syntax used to define XML), and I am interested in this URL. I have filed this bug so that the URL can be corrected or can be removed from the XML. Attached is the full dumpxml. Here is a snippet of it:\n\n  <metadata>\n    <nova:instance xmlns:nova=\"http://openstack.org/xmlns/libvirt/nova/1.0\">\n      <nova:package version=\"16.0.0\"/>\n      <nova:name>ttt</nova:name>\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Launch an instance\n2. Goto compute node where the instance is running.\n3. Do \"virsh dumpxml <instance-name>\"\n4. Check the URL in dumped output.",
