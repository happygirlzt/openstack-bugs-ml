The current fix ensures\n    that the public dnsName and the public ipAddress both get only\n    the floating ip address. A look into Amazon's EC2 API Reference\n    tells us that if there is no public IP associated with an instance,\n    an empty value is returned for <dnsName> and the key <ipAddress>\n    itself is never returned. This was tested with euca2ools.\n    Also, the key <publicDnsName> has been removed since it is\n    the same as <dnsName>\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1096468\n    \n    Change-Id: I3b3e3b3f815df41d1976444d33604363e64a7709\n",
