A really simple (to minimise potential for crashes) agent should be monitoring the components and raising an alert in case of failure or just try restarting nova.\nFor 2) we need to at the very least mark the instances as not running anymore. To make this happen, something must look through the list of registered compute nodes and see if they've failed to provide a heartbeat recently, and mark their VM's accordingly.\n3) is more involved. We'll need a big discussion about network partitioning (in CAP parlance) and such at some point, and the outcome of that will likely make this pretty straightforward. Here's hoping.",
