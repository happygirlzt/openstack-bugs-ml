There is another patch against this bug to modify\n    cinder.\n    \n    The attach call is being made against the new volume after the\n    migrate_volume_completion request. This means it may be done after the\n    new volume ID in the db has been deleted.\n    \n    The detach call is being run at the end on the old ID and so may end up\n    detaching the migrated volume from cinder's perspective.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3f2d98e9e473905a3de2f02e00c92ae3065e6ae7\n    Partial-Bug: 1316079\n",
