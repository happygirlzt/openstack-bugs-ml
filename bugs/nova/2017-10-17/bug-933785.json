    "description": "When creating a server, the security group names must be specified as an element.  Everywhere else, the name is an attribute.  This is painful.\n\nI'm proposing a fix that checks for an attribute first on server create, but then falls back to an element so any XML clients will continue to work.  Eventually I think we'll want to deprecate the element fallback.\n\nI've already written and proposed the patch, but I wanted to link it to a bug report:\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#change,4232",

We have to be backwards\n    compatible, so we check the attribute first, and then check the element.\n    \n    Bug #933785\n    \n    Change-Id: I66b96376043e665a026eff5c33aa0731a81730cc\n",
