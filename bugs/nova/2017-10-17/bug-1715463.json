Problem is there's already an entry for 'nova-osapi_compute', so now the insert fails because of duplicate entries.\n\nSo NAME has to be changed, or append 'nova-' on both queries.\n\n\nAlso the queries\n\nSELECT\nif exists UPDATE\nif not exists INSERT\n\nCould really just boil down to \n\nUPDATE\nif fail INSERT\n\nThis way it's atomic aswell.",
