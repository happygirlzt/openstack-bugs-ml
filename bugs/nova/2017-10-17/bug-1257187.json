This patch\n    adds a check to see if the instance is locked in the compute api live migrate.\n    \n    Adds a testcase for V3 and generic instance lock checking for the V2 API since\n    none existed yet.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1257187\n    \n    Change-Id: I442abb74fe2a4d5d46b597b0ea24d249d2d03b45\n",
