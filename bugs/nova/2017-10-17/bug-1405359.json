See:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2176ba7881e4ccae107bb6e614f8854b87f60a65/nova/compute/manager.py#L2175\n\nAlso in filters - we set it on the instance_dict that is part of the request_spec - this never even makes it to the compute nodes.\n\nThat said - this bug does make consume_from_instance() account for the potentially wrong topology (it subtracts the one calculated from the last potential host which may or may not be the one that was chose and that we are consuming it from). This in turn can cause requests for multiple instances with NUMA to fail and hit retry more than they need to.\n\nSo it is definitely a bug, just it is limited to exibiting itself only for multiple requests.",
