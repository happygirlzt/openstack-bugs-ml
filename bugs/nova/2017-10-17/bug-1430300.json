This operation does not abort live migration process - VM is paused on source host and after successful live migration VM is back online on destination host (hypervisor automatically starts VM).\n\nIn current approach in nova there is no way to do anything with VM that is being live migrated, even when the process will take ages (or in the worst case scenario - will never end). To address this issue nova should be able to pause instances during live migration operation.",
