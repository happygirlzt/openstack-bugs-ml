    "description": "I have found that the image cache manager is deleting needed images under _base when the following scenario happens:\n\n1. Using shared storage\n2. All instances (1 or more) of a certain image or snapshots are running on one compute node\n3. That compute node is taken down for 10 minutes or so (reboot, maintenance, etc)\n4. Other compute nodes see that the _base file is not in use and deletes it\n5. The compute node comes back online and the instance(s) running on that compute node can no longer start due to the _base image being removed.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further information or clarification on the above.\n\nThanks,\nJoe",
