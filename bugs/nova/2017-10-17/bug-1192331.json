It used to have 'extra_specs' and now it doesn't.\n\nThis means that any filters that rely on extra_specs being present either:  are traceback'ing... or... are not filtering properly.\n\nThis applies to both the cells scheduler and the host scheduler.",

This is a bit ugly, but will get cleaned up\n    with objects.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1192331\n    \n    Change-Id: I3614f3a858840c9561b4e618fc30f3d3ae5ac689\n",
