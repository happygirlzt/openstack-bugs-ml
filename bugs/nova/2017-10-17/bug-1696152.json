There is a possible confusion as the REST API uses\n    'nova-osapi_compute' while the notifications use 'nova-api'\n    as the name of the nova compute service binary.\n    \n    To make it clear that these names used in the notifications\n    are not the official service names the field storing it is renamed\n    from 'binary' to 'source'. This renaming means that the version of\n    NotificationPublisher ovo needed a major version bump. However this\n    does not effect the consumers of the notifications as the\n    NotificationPublisher is not directly serialized to the payload wire\n    format. Instead the value  of the 'source' and 'host' fields are\n    dumped into the publisher_id field of the notification envelope.\n    Therefore this patch does not introduce a backward incompatible\n    change from the notification consumer perspective.\n    \n    A subsequent patch will change this field to an enum to furter clarify\n    the possible values for notifications.\n    \n    Change-Id: I95b5b0826190d396efe7bfc017f6081a6356da65\n    Related-Bug: #1696152\n",
