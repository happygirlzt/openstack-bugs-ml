Instead, this would be useful for live migration or snapshots. \n\nAnyways, in my opinion, this is hardly a feature, it sounds to me more like a Low / wishlist bug. At the very most, it should be a specless blueprint. Implementing this is fairly trivial, as the mentioned Msvm_ConcreteJobs objects are already queried to check their status.",
