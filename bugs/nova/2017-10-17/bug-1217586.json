This results in\n    the compute manager failing to init the host because it's not catching\n    NotImplementedError from driver.plug_vifs.\n    \n    This patch simply changes the powervm driver plug_vifs method back to\n    the old behavior (pass), but at least logs a debug message this time.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1217586\n    \n    Change-Id: Iafe87cbb9b3cf728a47cb9cc43151798fcbb780f\n",
