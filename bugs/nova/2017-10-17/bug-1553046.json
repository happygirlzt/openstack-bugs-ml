That's essentially not supported. Actions should be performed on the guest VM via the Nova API, like suspending or stopping the VM.\n\nThe _sync_power_states periodic task in the compute manager is synchronizing the nova database (which thinks the instance was active) with the hypervisor (which shows the guest as suspended).  So nova resolves the difference by stopping the instance.",
