Even though we want to\n    discourage usage of device names as much as possible in the Nova API (as\n    not all hypervisors can honour them), EC2 API requires that this is possible.\n    \n    While we want to make sure we document that supplying device names at\n    boot is only really desirable if you want to override some of the ones\n    contained in the image, introducing a different labeling system just so\n    that we don't use the device names seems like an overkill for a feature\n    that does not seem to be very used.\n    \n    This patch adds a method that will do this deterministically when\n    compiling all the block device information for the request.\n    \n    It is also worth noting that The EC2 API allows only subset of block\n    device attributes to be overridden in this way (see [1]). This limitation\n    did not exist previously in Nova, and there seems to be no reason why we\n    would need that complexity, so it would be up to the EC2 compatibility\n    code to deal with this.\n    \n    [1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html#Using_OverridingAMIBDM\n    \n    Doc-Impact\n    Closes-bug: #1370250\n    \n    Change-Id: I60ecdcae81ff5dec34f0fa0a39e0739759a6fa59\n",
