In absence of a return value, it will make a new rpc call to to get the missing nw_info model. By changing the two API methods so that they return the models that they in fact already get, these extra calls can be avoided altogether.\n\nIn addition, having the API methods return updated nw_info models make it possible to further improve as in compute manager, calls to these methods are immediately followed by calls to get updated nw_info.",

This allows the @refresh_cache\n    decorator to use returned nw_info model for updating instance\n    info cache instead of needing to make another rpc call to get\n    that same information.\n    \n    Tests are added to make sure return values are used by the\n    refresh_cache decorator for methods where the rpc call returns\n    with the necessary nw_info model.\n    \n    Change-Id: I748e4db9de62d82e4dbcb0b9c444b16dabf0ec5d\n    Partial-Bug: #1284345\n",
