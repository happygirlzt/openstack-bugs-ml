Looks like lxml doesn't support 1.1 schema or the backward compatible attributes (min/maxVersion). \n\nAs a work around, I've written an  XSLT that allows converting the XSDs to version 1.0.  I'm attaching this.  My recommendation would be that we process the XSDs with the XSL before we have lxml consume them.\n\nGoing XSD 1.0 means that while we can validate core attributes and elements, we won't be able to find errors with the extensions. Not a big deal since there are no extensions defined right now anyway.\n\nI realize that there are only a few 1.1 implementations but things seem to be moving in this direction and we have good work arounds for the time being.\n\nYou can run the XSL with xsltproc, you should be able to automate this in the code\n\n xsltproc .s1.0p.xsl server.xsd\n\n\n",
