The reason for this\n    was that the nova compute would not set the correct datacenter for the\n    selected datastore.\n    \n    The fix also takes care of the correct folder selection. This too was a\n    result of not selecting the correct folder for the data center.\n    \n    The 'fake' configuration was updated to contain an additional data\n    center with its on datastore.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1180044\n    Closes-Bug: #1214850\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Shawn Harsock <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib61811fffcbc80385efc3166c9e366fdaa6432bd\n",
