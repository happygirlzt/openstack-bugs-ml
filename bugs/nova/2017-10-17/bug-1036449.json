    "description": "The following change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/11299/ does not seem to work. By not passing in topic, the topic is mistakenly assumed to be scheduler when it should be compute for live migration.\n\nAs a result the call fails at the scheduler complaining about a wrong number of arguments.\n\nFixed by reverting ccac8614279d9511e8571933db425b6de112c49c and adding topic=FLAGS.compute_topic back to self.scheduler_rpcapi.live_migration in nova/compute/api.py \nIt appears as if the topic argument was intentionally removed, so it is unclear how this should be fixed in that case.",
