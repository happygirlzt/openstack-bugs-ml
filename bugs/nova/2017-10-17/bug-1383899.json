The end result of which is the following error during boot:\n\nnova-compute.log:2014-10-10 16:04:30.829 19672 TRACE nova.utils [instance: uuid] raise Failure(result['ErrorDescription'])\nnova-compute.log:2014-10-10 16:04:30.829 19672 TRACE nova.utils [instance: uuid] Failure: ['BOOTLOADER_FAILED', 'OpaqueRef:cd142319-cf6e-c2eb-8c1d-b303a5157ac2', 'Disk has no partitions\\n']\n\nThis happens because auto_disk_config gets a size value from the flavor root_gb setting, but when booting from a volume this value is ignored in favor of the volume size.  This can lead to unexpected behavior when volume size > root_gb, and the above error when volume size < root_gb.",
