If instance went to error, we should set the\n    migration to error so we don't retry.  Also, if we get any other\n    exceptions when trying to confirm resizes, we should not bail out of the\n    loop.  Also: be nice to other greenthreads and yield on each iteration.\n    \n    Includes complete unit test for xenapi poll_unconfirmed_resizes which\n    didn't exist prior to this patch.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6f7c1ccfd4be0f1497727d817130a821902d134d\n",
