Refactor the code so that we've only one such list.\n    \n    Introduce a SignatureKeyType class which encapsulates all the info about\n    each signature key type and which also maintains a registry of key\n    types.\n    \n    In a subsequent patch, this refactoring makes it easier to only register\n    ECC curves which are available on the platform.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1528393\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic9fa1bd2149fdcdc3fc27688f6e8b141b23d8757\n    Signed-off-by: Mark McLoughlin <email address hidden>\n",

See the bug report for more\n    details and history.\n    \n    The cryptography backend has a elliptic_curve_supported() method\n    which we can use to avoid curves which are unavailable on the current\n    platform.\n    \n    If an image signature uses one of these curves, we will return an\n    \"Invalid signature key type\" error.\n    \n    Use the warnings module in the unit tests to avoid silently ignoring\n    this issue during testing. This warning will be captured from the\n    test's stderr and reported by testr.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1528393\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie25311c48b276f300fadaf1815fc4df4cb89cf8d\n    Signed-off-by: Mark McLoughlin <email address hidden>\n",
