This was\n    originally fixed in the following commit, but unfortunately the fix was\n    coupled with EngineFacade changes, so it's not a simple backport. This\n    patch just splits out the format string bug fix, so it can be\n    backported.\n    \n        enginefacade: 'flavor' - Use enginefacade in 'flavor' section.\n        https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/c85cd57c5c156b479db75c9f14fd916f7b64298e\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1528250\n    Change-Id: I2f57bb46d087948792e749905a0c060d009fbcf8\n    (cherry picked from commit c85cd57c5c156b479db75c9f14fd916f7b64298e)\n",
