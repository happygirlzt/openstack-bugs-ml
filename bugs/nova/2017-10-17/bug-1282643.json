    "description": "## What we did:\n\nWe were trying to use block migration in a setup that use LVM as libvirt storage:\n\nnova live-migrate --block-migrate <uuid> <host-name>\n\n## Current Result:\n\nNothing happens, no migration, but in libvirtd.log of the destination hypervisor we saw:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0error : virNetClientProgramDispatchError:175 : Failed to open file '/dev/instances/instance-0000015f_disk': No such file or directory\n\nthe /dev/instances/instance-0000015f_disk is the root disk of our instance.\n\n## What we found:\n\nAfter a bit of wondering in the code of nova, we saw that nova in the destination host actually fails to create the instance resources. This should have been done as part of pre_live_migration RPC call, but this one doesn't receive any disks in the disk_info argument (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/havana/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L4132) except the config disk. We found that this due to the fact that LVM disks (e.g. root disk) are skipped by driver.get_instance_disk_info method, specially by this line https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L4585-L4587, which skip any disk that is not a file thinking that it must be a block storage which not true because LVM disk are created as a block type (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/havana/nova/virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py#L358), snippets for the libvirt.xml below:\n\n\u00a0<devices>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<disk type=\"block\" device=\"disk\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<driver name=\"qemu\" type=\"raw\" cache=\"none\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<source dev=\"/dev/instances/instance-00000163_disk\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<target bus=\"virtio\" dev=\"vda\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</disk>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<disk type=\"file\" device=\"cdrom\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<driver name=\"qemu\" type=\"raw\" cache=\"none\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<source file=\"/var/lib/nova/instances/6ed79840-c850-498f-9607-ffa92e7cf944/disk.config\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<target bus=\"ide\" dev=\"hdd\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</disk>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<interface type=\"bridge\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<mac address=\"fa:16:3e:f0:61:24\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<model type=\"virtio\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<source bridge=\"brqe914da2f-c4\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<target dev=\"tap258425f6-9b\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</interface>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<serial type=\"file\">\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<source path=\"/var/lib/nova/instances/6ed79840-c850-498f-9607-ffa92e7cf944/console.log\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</serial>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<serial type=\"pty\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<input type=\"tablet\" bus=\"usb\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<graphics type=\"vnc\" autoport=\"yes\" keymap=\"en-us\" listen=\"0.0.0.0\"/>\n\u00a0\u00a0</devices>",
