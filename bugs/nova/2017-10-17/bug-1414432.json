If 'local_gb' is defined as the local non-shared storage on each compute node, then the statistics is wrong. But in this case, the problem is not caused by the  stats calculation, but the wrong usage of rbd backend.  If 'local_gb' is interpreted as the available storage space seen by each compute node, including the cases of shared and non-shared. Then there's no bug in Nova code and the client should not add up 'local_gb' to get the total space if it's shared storage. Actually,  it makes more sense to collect total usage of shared storage from storage specific administration software.",
