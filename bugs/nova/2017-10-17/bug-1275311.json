    "description": "We currently do not enable the \"bootmenu\" option within Libvirt.  It would be beneficial to do so, to allow for some more flexibility when installing a new OS from ISO.  Having the bootmenu available would allow for the following:\n\n1. Upload ISO image to Glance.\n2. Upload \"empty\" RAW image to Glance.\n3. Create a new Cinder volume, populating it with the ISO from #1.\n4. Create a new instance, using the empty RAW from #2.\n5. Attach the CInder volume from #3.\n\nAt this point, the instance has 2 disks attached: the root disk (vda) and volume (vdb).  In this case, we want to boot vdb, so that we can utilize the ISO to install an OS on vda.  There is currently no way to do this, short of passing block-device-mapping, which is not the same end result.  Enabling the bootmenu would prompt the user to hit F12 and select the desired boot device (vdb in this case).\n\nThis is an extremely simple change which provides a non-external option for creating Nova compatible images.",

If you want to implement this, you should file it under \"Wishlist\" and submit a blueprint to Nova https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints. The blueprint is important so that implementation details can be hashed out before you submit code. This way, obvious problems, like the one pointed out by Daniel, can be avoided, saving yours and reviewer's time.\n\nDan",

This allows for flexibility in\n    setting/overriding the default behavior as needed.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes-Bug: 1275311\n    Change-Id: I1e1d2ef7815d805827ce3a9cbbef023f1b3ca7dc\n",
