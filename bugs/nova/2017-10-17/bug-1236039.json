I know the gate tests breaks when removing it, though I still don't know which part broke. I am not aware of any issue. We ran the tempest suite without pb.\n\nAlso, do you realize that both Ubuntu 13.10 and Sid have SQLAlchemy 0.8? It's not like if we have an option here.\n\nBTW, I have added some fixes in Grizzly, and as much as I know, it's no problem for me.\n\nLast if it wasn't clear: I'm asking that *both* trunk and the Havana branch are fixed.",
