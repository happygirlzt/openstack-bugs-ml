Are you comfortable submitting this via the standard Gerrit workflow (http://wiki.openstack.org/GerritWorkflow)?  This would set you up for future contributions as well.\n\nOr, I can also submit it on your behalf, if you prefer.\n\n",

            "content": "Looking at the code - this actually seems to be the intended behaviour. Rescue is supposed to just create a way to log into a wayward instance if something goes wrong with the base image that may have had some data (logfiles etc.) and make it possible to grab that - block devices are assumed to be accessible by attaching them again and are considered persistant so no need for rescue there.\n\nHaving all this in mind it does make sense to dissallow rescuing an instance booted from volume as it does not make any sens (all the data is persisted to the volume anyway), so this might be a worthwhile fix.\n\nThis may change in the future tho since we may add support for booting form volumes that are targeted to local discs (kind of like using a volume for an image) however this is not the case yet so disabling resuce if instance is booted from volume makes sense.",
