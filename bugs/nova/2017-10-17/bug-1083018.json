    "description": "Fixing a bug associated with resuming instances (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1052696) required updates to the compute manager.  These updates broke 2 HyperV tests (test_resume, test_resume_already_running), which I was unable to resolve even after consulting other members of the Nova Core team.  The conclusion was to proceed with disabling the tests and file this bug once the change was committed, so that these tests could be fixed by the appropriate folks.\n\nThe commit can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/99b5e96795b8475f14d53bbc3845e7bace730963",
