A formula could also be used with a factor relative to the size of the storage.\n\nIdeally, this could also be specified as an image or flavor property so that only large drives would need to allocate the additional memory.\n\nI could not locate an option such as this in the OpenStack versions up to Liberty.",

The correct value is going to be dependent on the guest workload rather than the cloud operator. Although I agree that the cloud operator could set the cache value to something much higher than 1MB without any downside?\n\nRegardless shouldn't this be made in to a blueprint as its a feature request rather than a bug? Especially since it could be adding new operator configuration options.\n\n",
