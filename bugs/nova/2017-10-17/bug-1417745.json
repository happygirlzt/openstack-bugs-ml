As of oslo.messaging commit f3370da11a867bae287d7f549a671811e8b399ef, the application must maintain a single reference to Transport or references to the connection pool will be lost.\n\nThe net effect of this is that cells constructs a new broker connection pool  (and a connection) on every message sent between cells.  This is leaking references to connections.",
