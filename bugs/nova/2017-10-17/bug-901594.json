Some additional info:\n\n * That bug was filed after an upgrade to essex release for a private cloud (\"Canonistack\") that Andrew and others maintain, so the bug represents an actual user finding the change unsatisfactory.\n * Essex level of openstack started filling the 'public_dns_name' and 'private_dns_name' fields in a EC2 DescribeInstances response with the hostname values. Previously, the response would contain an ipv4 value.  The result is that a user *used* to be able to use the output of 'euca-describe-instances' to get to an instance, but now, they cannot, as the hostname returned is not resolvable.\n * Ubuntu's euca2ools has a '--ipv4' patch that allows  https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/euca2ools/describe-ipv4/+merge/84881\n",
