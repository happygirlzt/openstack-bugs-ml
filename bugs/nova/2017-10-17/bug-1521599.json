I looked into it and I think the problem is that two ports are being deleted in the test, but can be deleted in either order.  The unit test assumes that one will be deleted before the other, so when they are deleted in the opposite order than the unit test expects, we get the following:\n\nb'mox3.mox.UnexpectedMethodCallError: Unexpected method call. unexpected:- expected:+'\nb\"- Client.delete_port('my_portid1') -> None\"\nb'? ^'\nb\"+ Client.delete_port('my_portid2') -> None\"\nb'?\n\n\nThe mox unit test assumes that my_portid2 will be deleted first, but instead my_portid1 is being deleted.  I think the fix for this is just to modify the unit test so it allows deletion in any order",
