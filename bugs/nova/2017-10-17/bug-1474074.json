That is problematic for people\n    doing commit-to-commit deployment of stable/kilo because upgrading your\n    conductor nodes before your computes will send back an unsupported\n    version 1.2. Just landing the version bump now means that all nodes will\n    tolerate a newer object, but conductors won't send it.\n    \n    This change is not on master (because it doesn't make sense there).\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibdfb0b52cc04e4055b83bad7c733e86bdc405d2a\n    Related-Bug: #1474074\n",
