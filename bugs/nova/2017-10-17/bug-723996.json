            "content": "In order to be flexible, the size limit should be configurable.  The main idea is to protect the hypervisor and prevent situations where large kernels or images were registered on purpose to cause host issues.  For example, XenServer only provides 4GB for dom0.  For builds with kernels outside of the instance, they are stored on the dom0 filesystem in /boot/guest and at a certain point could fill up the filesystem if not kept in check. \n\nIn talking with Rick Harris it would probably be set at the compute layer, either a limit per image or file, or an overall filesystem percentage free space check.
