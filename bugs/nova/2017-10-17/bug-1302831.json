There are a number of \"types\" of issues that need\n    to be fixed:\n    \n    * E112 expected an indented block\n    * E241 multiple spaces after ','\n    * E265 block comment should start with '# '\n    * E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1\n    * H102 Apache 2.0 license header not found\n    * H237 module module is removed in Python 3\n    * H303 No wildcard (*) import.\n    * H404 multi line docstring should start without a leading new line\n    * H231 Python 3.x incompatible 'except x,y:' construct\n    * F403 from module import *' used; unable to detect undefined names\n    * F841 local variable 'name' is assigned to but never used\n    * N344 Use six.iteritems() instead of dict.iteritems().\n    \n    The fixes for the above are all pretty self-explanatory, but there is\n    one exception. The 'N344' issues are not ignorable due to how the\n    \"hacking\" check is implemented. Rather than ignoring them, skip the\n    issue altogether by replacing 'iteritems' with 'items'. The difference\n    in memory usage that this incurs should not be noticable.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie26e3daca3b408c9ea43613bcb9996618b9abc69\n    Partial-Bug: #1302831\n",

To avoid forcing operators to upgrade the\n    Nova service and per-host plugins at the same time, continue to\n    reference the old, non-'.py' filenames, using symlinks to ensure the\n    references continue to work. Once Ocata has been released, these\n    symlinks can be removed, the API version updated and the reference\n    updated to include the '.py' extension.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icf4cf2424c15276a6c01778fb92f76bbdc9b2068\n    Closes-bug: #1302831\n",
