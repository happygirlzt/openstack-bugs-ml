Today, you can define a\n    bootable volume that is sourced from an image, volume, or\n    snapshot. However, you cannot define a volume that is sourced\n    from 'blank', even though it is one of the source options\n    available. For example, the following command will not work:\n    nova boot --flavor m1.tiny\n    --block-device source=blank,dest=volume,size=1,bootindex=0 test.\n    This is because the method used to identify ephemeral volumes\n    (new_format_is_ephemeral) believes any block device with\n    source_type=blank is an ephemeral, and there is no logic to\n    handle volumes where source_type=blank. The following patch\n    fixes these bugs by properly identifying ephemeral block\n    devices and creating blank/empty volumes when source_type=blank\n    and destination_type=volume.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5aa9684bfad1749fadff3018b13a225ed8f16fe8\n    Closes-Bug: #1347028\n    Closes-Bug: #1347499\n",
