    "description": "If the user sets reclaim_instance_interval to anything other than 0, then when a user requests an instance delete, it will instead be soft deleted. Soft delete explicitly releases the user's quota, but does not release the instance's resources until period task _reclaim_queued_deletes runs with a period of reclaim_instance_interval seconds.\n\nA malicious authenticated user can repeatedly create and delete instances without limit, which will consume resources on the host without consuming their quota. If done quickly enough, this will exhaust host resources.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what to suggest in remediation, as this seems to be a deliberate design. The most obvious fix would be to not release quota until the instance is reaped, but that would be a significant change in behaviour.\n\nThis is very similar to https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/cve/2015-3280 , except that we do it deliberately.",
