However,\n    it's calling db.instance_create with an extra kwarg that doesn't exist\n    and failing.  This patch removes the extra kwarg.\n    \n    The bug was introduced in this change id:\n    \n    Ife5be9922db0742c8ee4f970517396be86597cce\n    \n    Change-Id: I69bcb3dda2cbb566b0d69c5eac005703654ea811\n    Closes-bug: 1247919\n",
