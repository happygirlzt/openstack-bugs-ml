This\n    doesn't actually cache the instance, which means repeated calls will\n    continue to trigger RPC and DB hits. Further, in resource tracker,\n    we have already pulled a list of instances and then proceed to re-query\n    them through lazy-loads from the migration objects, even though we\n    already have them. To add insult to injury, neither this first list\n    of instances, nor the ones pulled from Migration.instance contain\n    instances with the 'flavor' or 'migration_context' properties\n    populated, which means we trigger *two* more lazy loads to pull those.\n    \n    This patch does a few things:\n     - Makes the Migration object cache its instance property\n     - Makes the resource tracker request instances with flavors and the\n       migration_context populated\n     - Stitches the instance list into the migration list to avoid the\n       two subsequent lazy loads of Instance and Instance.flavor\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifc7dcde8a659710acecb1967da15c632c69d675c\n    Partial-Bug: #1540526\n",
