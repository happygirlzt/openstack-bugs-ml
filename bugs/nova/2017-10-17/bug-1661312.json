Instance running on host A, placement has allocations for instance on host A\n2. Host A goes down\n3. Instance is evacuated to host B, host B creates duplicated allocations in placement for instance\n4. Host A comes up, notices that instance is gone, deletes all allocations for instance on both hosts A and B\n5. Instance now has no allocations for a period\n6. Eventually, host B will re-create the allocations for the instance\n\nThe period between #4 and #6 will have the scheduler making bad decisions because it thinks host B is less loaded than it is.",
