I have installed devstack  and was able to re-create the \"test-1 and test-2 instance names\" scenario by running 'nova boot --flavor <flavor>  --image <image> --max-count 2  test'.   I was not able to re-create the \"test-1-1  and test-1-2\" scenario.  Would kindly like to ask what command format was executed to re-create this scenario?  \n\nThank you. \n\n\n",
