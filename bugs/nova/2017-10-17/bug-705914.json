If this happens inside of nova-network, whenever it shuts down (for upgrade, or any other reason) it will stop dhcp for running instances.  IMO all of the nova services should be able to be stopped without interrupting service to client machines.  I agree that there should be some way for this cleanup to be performed (as well as iptables cleanup), I'm just not sure that stopping the service is the right way to do this.\n\nOn Jan 21, 2011, at 8:26 AM, Thierry Carrez wrote:\n\n> ** Changed in: nova\n>   Importance: Undecided => Low\n> \n> ** Changed in: nova\n>       Status: New => Confirmed\n> \n> -- \n> You received this bug notification because you are a member of Nova Bug\n> Team, which is subscribed to OpenStack Compute (nova).\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/705914\n> \n> Title:\n>  nova-network should stop dnsmasq when it stops\n> \n> Status in OpenStack Compute (Nova):\n>  Confirmed\n> \n> Bug description:\n>  When nova-network stops (in VlanManager mode), it leaves behind the\n>  dnsmasq instances it fired up.

We had the same type of issues with Eucalyptus, and the way we (Ubuntu) solved it at packaging-level was rather suboptimal (passing CLEAN=1 to the upstart stop call). I wonder if there is a saner way to handle that. Keeping the bug open to foster discussion, but renaming.",
