Ie, there are a lot of calls to self._instance_update() that\n    ignore the response and use a stale copy of data from that point\n    forward.\n    \n    Related to bug 1098727\n    \n    That bug id is for 'reboot_instance' only, so there's a separate patch\n    to fix that method.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifec6bf23831b51c8679528428ee475c906c1f536\n",
