            "content": "Thanks Jay for giving me the direction to find out the root cause.\n\nRoot Cause-\nIn nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/keypairs.py -> show(), tzinfo needs to be corrected by making it None in datetime object. This is how it was stored in database. \nWhen database value is stored in datetime object (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/objects/base.py#L437), TZ also gets added here.  If in database, created time is being stored with microsecond also then, microsecond and TZ both comes in created_at format. \nSo we need to strip the tzinfo while returing the response. \n ",

It's not actually an ISO8601 timestamp, but we don't use the ISO8601 format in our XML output\n\nSo ... I think this bug is valid. The XML sample validation should allow a str(datetime) timestamp which includes both timezone and microsecond information.",
