    "description": "If a compute node has been reconfigured such that its allocations are above its available capacity, the resource tracker still needs to be able to report existing allocations without failure so that it doesn't get in a stuck state.\n\nTo that end, we will make it so that when sending allocations via a PUT, if those allocations are already present in the data store, will respond with success but neither write the database, nor update the resource provider generation. This allows the resource tracker to know \"yeah, you've got my data\" and feel at peace with the state of the world.",
