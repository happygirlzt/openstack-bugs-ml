While this is wasteful, its the only safe\n    answer to ensure you don't over commit resources on the node.\n    \n    Updated the test so the swap is 1023MB, after rounding up this should\n    claim the same 1GB extra space for swap.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1659266\n    \n    Change-Id: If50eab870b2c50f4055668143780574e1350a438\n",
