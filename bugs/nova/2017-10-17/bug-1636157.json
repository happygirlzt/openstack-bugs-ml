It is thus impossible to provide different RBAC for specific\n    actions based on roles. To address this changes are made to have\n    separate policy rules for each of action.\n    \n    It has been argued that index and show may not need separate policy\n    rules, but most other places in nova (and OpenStack in general) do\n    have separate policy rules for each action. This affords the ultimate\n    flexibility to deployers, who can obviously use the same rule if\n    that is what they want. One example where show and index may be\n    different is that if show is restricted based on some criteria, such\n    that a user is able to see some resources within the tenant but not\n    others, then list would need to be disallowed to prevent the user\n    from using list to see resources they cannot show.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ica9e07f6e80257902b4a0cc44b65fd6bad008bba\n    Closes-Bug: #1636157\n",
