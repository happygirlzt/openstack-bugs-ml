    "description": "When the placement service gets a bad method for an existing URL it raises an HTTPMethodNotAllowed exception. It does this outside of the WebOb wsgify context, meaning the the exception is caught the the FautlWrapper middleware and perceived to be an uncaught exception and logged as such, muddying the log files with something that is normal.\n\nWe don't see this log messaages in CI because we don't accidentally cause 405s. Where we intentionally cause them (in gabbi tests) the log message is recorded in the subunit data but not in the test output because the tests pass (passing tests do not display those messages).[1]\n\nThe fix is to treat the HTTPMethodNotAllowed as a wsgi app instead of an exception and call it. When doing that, things work as desired. Fix forthcoming.\n\n\n[1] I discovered this because the subunit files on https://review.openstack.org/362766 were cresting the 50M limit, because in that change the api sample tests were passing but having all kinds of errors with the placement fixture (I've since fixed the patch) generating vast amounts of log messagse on successful tests. Digging in there also revealed the error message that this bug wants to deal with.",
