    "description": "On rare occasion we have noticed that using nova-network and the VlanManage fixed_ip aren't always marked as free during instance termination until the _disassociate_stale_fixed_ips periodic job is run.\n\nThe issue occurs as a result of dnsmasq is restarted. On restart the nova-dhcpbridge command is called with the init arguement to populate the dnsmasq lease DB. The lease time, is presently being calculated by taking instances.updated_at or instances.created_at and adding CONF.dhcp_lease_time. Unfortunately these fields are not updated by normal DHCP actions. At dnsmasq start time the old leases are loaded and immediately expired. As a result of this nova-dhcpbridge is called with the del action and fixed_ips.leased is marked as 0 in the DB even though a VM has a valid lease.\n\nIf a termination is issued while in this state dnsmasq will receive the release packet and drop it claiming the lease is unknown. As a result nova-dhcpbridge is not called to free the lease in the DB and the IP remains in a partially freed state until the _disassociate_stale_fixed_ips periodic job is run.\n\nDuring normal DHCP operations the fixed_ips.updated_at field is updated on a lease request or renewal. As such the dnsmasq lease DB should be initialized from fixed_ips.updated_at or fixed_ips.created_at instead of the values from the instances table.",
