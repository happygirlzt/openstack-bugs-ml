As result we get instance only with pointed port_id.\nIn case when we send same request using interface-attach we get BadRequest answer here\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/attach_interfaces.py#L96 \nbecause we have port_id and network_id together in request.\n\nAlso I have look in v3 plugins and it have a little difference.\nIf we have not None value for port_id and fixed_ip, will be raised Error\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/plugins/v3/servers.py#L348\nbut it still ignore network_id.\n\nIf it's normal behavior: Could you explain why nova send BadRequest Error in same case during attaching interface.",
