Mitchell <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Nov 21 14:39:22 2011 -0600\n\n    Put instances in ERROR state when scheduler fails.\n    \n    When the scheduler's selected driver method raises an exception, such\n    as NoValidHost, any affected instance must be placed into the ERROR\n    state.  This is done by catching exceptions raised in _schedule() and,\n    if 'instance_id' is present in kwargs, moving the identified instance\n    to the ERROR state.  This fixes bug 886289.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5c73549e073493701b86658569823b9bc161291d\n",
