The issue seems to stem from the fact that the OSAPI and EC2 API's noauth code now generates and use different user_id's within the same project.\n\nAfter creating a keypair I found the following in my key_pairs table:\n\nmysql> select user_id from key_pairs;\n+----------------------+\n| user_id              |\n+----------------------+\n| hdJbmeRuyJAkRtWc9c6t |\n+----------------------+\n\n---\n\nThe OSAPI noauth manager however still uses 'admin' as the user_id in the RequestContext. So using the same novarc file:\n\n-You can create a keypair with the EC2 API.\n-But you can no longer use that keypair via the OSAPI (because your user_id is different)",
