            "content": "This won't be fixed in diablo. Please confirm whether this is still an issue in folsom.\r\n\r\nThere is also an issue about whether or not this is unexpected behavior, as the client was returned a 413 correct, so it can renegotiate for a smaller max_count. The count quota wasn't actually what was hit, it was a memory quota. I'm not sure what the size limits on your flavorRef: 100 actually are, so it's hard to tell if it was 20 VMs at that flavor size that caused the problem. In which case I believe this is working as designed.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to reopen with more info, though a recreate on folsom is important as well.",
