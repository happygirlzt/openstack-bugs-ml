So, we should coerce those to strings to make\n    sure SA is happy.\n    \n    This also fixes a small bit of DB-loading logic where a FloatingIP\n    would try to load its associated FixedIP explicitly. Obviously,\n    if it's not associated, it shouldn't try to do that.\n    \n    Related to blueprint compute-manager-objects-juno\n    Closes-bug: #1351020\n    \n    Change-Id: I97b4a86846020b58950f7c051cb003b7b09e938a\n",
