Also, there is potential here for a situation where a client that is expecting unpaginated JSON starts getting paginated JSON. Because of this issue, and the fact that no one else is complaining, this change is being abandoned. A patch that documents which resources respect osapi_max_limit and which resources don't will be submitted separately.",
