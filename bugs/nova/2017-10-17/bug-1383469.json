The DB API is backwards\n    compatible if columns_to_join is None, and expected_attrs\n    defaults to None already.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d8b5a1fd58783e465001bb5f10b5b87d69198d9\n    Partial-Bug: #1383469\n",

That adds\n    unnecessary load times on the DB query and data processing when\n    constructing the instance list, especially given this is a query over a\n    time range of instances, so as you add more instances to scale it's\n    going to slow down.\n    \n    This simply limits the expected_attrs in the get_active_by_window_joined\n    call to system_metadata so we don't load the other unnecessary\n    attributes.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1383469\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic77d51cd45730ca664e68cfe0cb1671b5442d4a9\n",
