This ensures that we have version mappings between objects that depend on each other, and that those versions and relationships are bumped when one object changes versions.\n\nThat test currently excludes any objects that are based on the List mixin, which obscures dependencies that do things like Foo->BarList->Bar.\n\nThe test needs to be modified to not exclude List-based objects, and the relationship map needs to be updated for the List objects that are currently excluded.",
