As most commandline use is moving towards nova client, rather\n    than nova-manage simply extending\n    the phrasing a little and encouraging users to read the man page.\n    \n    Placing nova client first, based on feedback\n    \n    fixes bug 766703\n    \n    Second patch - addresses concerns from previous patches about leading\n    with novaclient, and emphasising that nova-manage is only for\n    administrators.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id94fe752a86c0e6c6ebeb2ed88a2f7526716f854\n",
