    "description": "Anytime an instance info_cache entry is updated, cells is notified.  There's a periodic task in nova-compute that heals the info_cache.  This happens to also heal the API cell.  But it's a duplication of effort that is also handled by the cells healing.  In a large environment, there's a lot of extra messages being sent from nova-compute to nova-cells which are unnecessary.\n\nThe info_cache healing should probably be made not to notify cells.",
