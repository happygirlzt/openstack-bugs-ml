I have a branch I need to push up and clean up.\n\nThere's a compatibility module in kombu, but I don't think it works with the current way nova/rpc.py is implemented.  (We have Consumer and Publisher classes that set self.<whatever> instead of passing settings to __init__() calls of the super class).  So, I started on code to replace carrot with kombu completely.",
