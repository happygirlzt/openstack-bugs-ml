I've tried the in progress root-wrap patch that was thought to have fixed this but the problem remains.\n\nTo reproduce:\n    Install latest devstack and remove cinder, c-vol, c-api and c-sch from ENABLED_SERVICES.\n    Add n-vol back in to ENABLED_SERVICES\n    Run stack.sh\n    Run exercises/volumes.sh\n\nSame issue is is currently being worked in Cinder, once it's resolved the changes can be ported back to Nova to fix this bug.",
