    "description": "The infra guys were noticing an issue where they were leaking floating ip\naddresses. One of the reasons this would occur for them is they called\nnova floating-ip-delete which first disassocates the floating-ip in neutron\nand then deletes it. Because it makes two calls to neutron if the first one\nsucceeds and the second fails it results in the instance no longer being\nassociated with the floatingip. They have retry logic but they base it on\nthe instance and when they go to retry cleaning up the instance the floatingip\nis no longer on the instance so they never delete it.  \n\nThis patch fixes this issue by directly calling delete_floating_ip instead\nof releasing first if using neutron as neutron allows this. I looked into \ndoing the same thing for nova-network but the code is written to prevent this.\nThis allows the operation to be atomic. I know this is sorta hackish that\nwe're doing this in the api layer but we do this in a few other places\ntoo fwiw.",
