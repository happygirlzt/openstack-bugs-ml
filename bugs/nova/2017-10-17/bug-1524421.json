    "description": "In Kilo we added the ability of the HostManager to track information about the instances on compute nodes, so that filters that needed this information didn't have to constantly make database calls to get it. However, the call that is used by HostManager will return deleted instance records, which is not useful information and degrades the performance. In a large deployment, the overhead of loading the records for thousands of deleted instances is causing serious performance issues.",
