    "description": "Qpid has a limitation where it cannot serialize a Python dict containing a string longer than 65535 characters.  This can result in problems when making a conductor call that returns a large structure - for example, instance_get_all_by_host on one of my systems returns 38 instances, which when serialized as JSON is too long for Qpid to handle.\n\nThere's a discussion of the limitation here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-4583\n\nI believe the best fix here is to wrap the string in a buffer as suggested in the link above.  This works fine on my local system and seems to fix the problem (note: I haven't tested against RabbitMQ yet, and right now I put the change in common code so that will need to be done).  However, that will be a backward compatibility breaking change because it will need to be handled differently on the receiving end as well.",
