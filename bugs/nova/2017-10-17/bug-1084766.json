You can't use that to read the first line(s) of root-readable files unless you're specifically allowed to run the rootwrap, which is restricted to the cinder/nova system user anyway, and those are not accounts local users should be allowed to switch to (unless they have root rights). So I would not treat it as an exploitable vulnerability (you need another massive vulnerability to make this one exploitable).\n\nThat said, it could be used as part of an attack (get cinder user access somehow, exploit this to escalate to root) so it should definitely be fixed. Nice finding :)\n\nI suggest we keep it private until I find the time to submit a (public) review to fix it.",

You can specify a facility (syslog_log_facility)\n    and level (syslog_log_level) to use. Finalizes bp nova-rootwrap-options.\n    \n    In doing so, it moves rootwrap config parsing to a nova.rootwrap.wrapper\n    object (and adds unit testing for it). It also improves log messages\n    content (including the name of the matching filter and the escalation\n    path used). Incidentally fixes bug 1084766.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idb8cd9c9febd6263dafab4bc2bff817f00c53dc0\n",
