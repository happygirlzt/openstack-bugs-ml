    "description": "Several virt drivers are using non-standard driver-specific image metadata properties. This creates an API contract between the external user and the driver implementation. These non-standard ones should be marked as deprecated in some way, enforced in v3, etc. We need a global whitelist of keys and values that are allowed so that we can make sure others don't leak in.\n\nExamples:\n\nnova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py:            os_type = image_properties.get(\"vmware_ostype\", \"otherGuest\")\nnova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py:            adapter_type = image_properties.get(\"vmware_adaptertype\",\nnova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py:            disk_type = image_properties.get(\"vmware_disktype\",\nnova/virt/vmwareapi/vmops.py:            vif_model = image_properties.get(\"hw_vif_model\", \"VirtualE1000\")\n\nnova/virt/xenapi/vm_utils.py:    device_id = image_properties.get('xenapi_device_id')\n\nI think it's important to try to get this fixed (or as close as possible) before the icehouse release.",
