The\n    problem is that set_members() is repeatedly called with the same\n    arguments over and over again because the list of security group IDs\n    contains duplicates. These duplicated calls are unnecessary because they\n    are idempotent.\n    \n    For instance, with a security group of 50 rules created in this manner:\n        neutron security-group-rule-create $SECGRP --remote_group_id $SECGRP\n            --protocol tcp --port_range_min $i --port_range_max $i\n    \n    Adding a server to that security group will cause 50 calls to\n    IpsetManager.set_members() because the list of security group IDs is 50 of\n    the same ID. Only one call to IpsetManager.set_members() is necessary\n    per security group ID.\n    \n    This patch converts that list of security group IDs into a set, which\n    eliminates the duplicate idempotent calls to\n    IpsetManager.set_members() with the same arguments. This will affect\n    performance by reducing the amount of file locking around ipset when\n    adding servers to security groups.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id2c8c8c1093c8abcf1fd897b23b0358aeb55b526\n    Closes-Bug: 1466921\n\ncommit f44800f1eb649d83a338d320020d3479fc3b6790\nAuthor: Cyril Roelandt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 22 14:59:59 2015 +0000\n\n    Python3: do not set Request.body to a text string\n    \n    In Python 3, Request.body must be set to a bytes object.\n    \n    Change-Id: I17785d1e9eb253a1c6cae300b207fb0a08873b0e\n    Blueprint: neutron-python3\n\ncommit 408af3f7dab477517b1761aeda2b76384f5fffbe\nAuthor: Assaf Muller <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Jun 21 15:34:21 2015 -0400\n\n    Prepare for full stack CI job\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1467275\n    \n    Change-Id: I90f4794f48ae151a888f37df26c087a7fdcd9d31\n\ncommit 76b4803530c0d5f47659aa519585178cc33cba46\nAuthor: Oleg Bondarev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 2 16:14:40 2015 +0300\n\n    Fix callback registry notification for security group rule\n    \n    Some housekeeping was done in\n     - SecurityGroupDbMixin:\n       - create_rule_bulk() calls to create_rule();\n       - registry notification is in create_rule();\n       - separate validation for a single rule and for a group of rules\n     - SecurityGroupServerRpcMixin:\n       - overriden methods call to corresponding super class methods;\n    \n    Hopefully code is now self-documented enough\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1461024\n    Change-Id: Ia75d7e206716bbe74aae89e4cebd0c2c40af68a8\n\ncommit 0faf4a264525ade97cd6c0ba6b3f34fceb88c210\nAuthor: Cyril Roelandt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 22 13:02:17 2015 +0000\n\n    Python3: do not use __builtin__\n    \n    It has been replaced with builtins in Python 3.

This greatly increased our probability\n    of multiple coroutines running transactions on the same table that\n    result in deadlocks.\n    \n    These deadlocks could result from many things including the following:\n    * a coroutine holding a pessimistic \"SELECT for UPDATE\" lock when\n      another tries to update the locked records\n    * two coroutines both issue update statements using a WHERE clause\n      invalidated by the other update (e.g. from a compare and swap approach)\n    * two coroutines insert records that, when combined, violate a unique\n      constraint on the table in a master-master Galera deployment\n    * any two workers using \"SELECT for UPDATE\" in a master-master Galera\n      deployment (write-set certification failure translates to deadlock)\n    \n    This problem is exacerbated by the switch to multiple API and RPC\n    workers, each of which can lead to most of the errors above even\n    without the switch to pymysql.\n    \n    This patch adds a deadlock retry decorator to the delete, create,\n    and update methods at the HTTP API layer. Additionally, it adds a\n    decorator to the update_port_status AMQP API in ML2 since it updates\n    the port table, which is a heavily locked table by ML2 making it a\n    prime candidate for deadlocks.\n    \n    Nova has had relied on the deadlock retry mechanism for quite some\n    time now. We were limping along by not using additional workers and\n    by relying on the unyielding nature of the MySQL C driver to\n    serialize everything.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1464612\n    Change-Id: I635cc49ca69f589f99ab145d4d51e511b24194d2\n\ncommit 95b6a74af10e2150b017647028de8454ef1cda2f\nAuthor: Aaron Rosen <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 16 17:23:09 2015 -0700\n\n    ovsdb: session.rpc never initialized\n    \n    Previously, if idl.Transaction.commit_block() returned a status of\n    TRY_AGAIN we would check self.api.idl._session.rpc.status which would\n    result in an attribute error as rpc is None.\n    \n    This patch fixes this attribute error by removing this unneeded check.

It uses lockutils.lock() which passes\n    do_log=True by default, which causes lockutils.lock() to do debug\n    logging about lock acquisition/release. IptablesManager itself also writes\n    debug log info about lock acquisition and release.\n    \n    This change will eliminate unnecessary duplicate logging in order to\n    reduce log noise about locking. This change is also related to\n    https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners/commit/f88f2fea7fe250b7d26cdcbc84633ccbbc68eeee\n    which reduces the logging level in the underlying lock implementation\n    used by oslo.concurrency.

neutron-server (multiprocess) and metadata agent\n    \n    All launchers implemented in common.service require each service to\n    implement reset method because it is called in case a process\n    receives a SIGHUP.\n    \n    This change adds the reset method to neutron.service.RpcWorker and\n    neutron.wsgi.WorkerService which are used to wrap rpc and api\n    workers correspondingly.\n    \n    Now neutron-server running in multiprocess mode (api_workers > 0 and\n    rpc_workers > 0) and metadata agent don't die on receiving SIGHUP and support\n    reloading policy_path and logging options in config.\n    \n    Note that reset is called only in case a service is running in daemon mode.\n    \n    Other changes made in the scope of this patch that need to be mentioned:\n    \n    * Don't empty self._servers list in RpcWorker's stop method\n    \n      When a service is restarted all services are gracefully shutdowned,\n      resetted and started again (see openstack.common.service code).\n      As graceful shutdown implies calling service.stop() and then\n      service.wait() we don't want to clean self._servers list because\n      it would be impossible to wait for them to stop processing\n      requests and cleaning up their resources.\n      Otherwise, this would lead to problems with rpc after starting\n      the rpc server again.\n    \n    * Create a duplicate socket each time WorkerService starts\n    \n      When api worker is stopped it kills the eventlet wsgi server\n      which internally closes the wsgi server socket object. This server\n      socket object becomes not usable which leads to \"Bad file\n      descriptor\" errors on service restart.\n    \n    Added functional and unit tests.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Partial-Bug: #1276694\n    Change-Id: I75b00946b7cae891c6eb192e853118e7d49e4a24\n\ncommit ea35b299f06050608f3e7bb6fbc880006ed31024\nAuthor: Kevin Benton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jun 3 18:25:14 2015 -0700\n\n    Allow update_port_status to take network param\n    \n    Allow the update_port_status function to take a network as\n    an optional parameter to skip calling get_network again if\n    the caller has already done so.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1463656\n    Change-Id: I994f3abdb1b0ad3b2766f409b206ad4a8b2309b6\n\ncommit d0be7bc57f573d5696108b571c731decfbde9f0b\nAuthor: Ihar Hrachyshka <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 9 12:46:54 2015 +0200\n\n    Make pep8 job succeed when /etc/neutron/neutron.conf is not installed\n    \n    Currently, if /etc/neutron/neutron.conf is not installed in the system,\n    neutron-db-manage fails in oslo.config code when trying to determine the\n    default configuration file to use.\n    \n    Test job should not rely on any contents inside /etc/.\n    \n    Instead, pass --config-file with test-only configuration explicitly into\n    the utility.\n    \n    neutron.conf.test was renamed into neutron.conf since for some reason\n    oslo.config does not support a name that does not have .conf at its\n    filename end.\n    \n    Change-Id: I719829fc83a7b20a49c338aaf1dbef916dcc768c\n\ncommit 826428dc8aeef124c2251624ae34fdc003e69ca4\nAuthor: YAMAMOTO Takashi <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 9 19:00:40 2015 +0900\n\n    Add a comment on _check_update_has_security_groups\n    \n    Despite of its name, _check_update_has_security_groups can\n    handle create requests as well.

This was the case\n    up to the Havana release as several plugins invoked the policy\n    engine directly to authorize requests.\n    \n    This was an incorrect behaviour and has now been fixed, meaning\n    that get_admin_roles is no longer need and can be safely removed.\n    This will result in a leaner and more reliable codebase. Indeed the\n    function being removed here was the cause of several bugs where the\n    policy engine was initialized too early in the server bootstrap\n    process.\n    While this patch removes the feature it does not remove the\n    load_admin_roles parameter from context.get_admin_context. Doing so\n    will break other projects such as neutron-lbaas. The parameter is\n    deprecated by this patch and an appropriate warning emitted.\n    \n    As a consequence neutron's will now no longer perform policy checks\n    when context.is_admin=True. This flag is instead set either when\n    a context is explicitly created for granting admin privileges, or\n    when Neutron is operating in noauth mode. In the latter case every\n    request is treated by neutron as an admin request, and get_admin_roles\n    is simply ensuring the appropriate roles get pushed into the context\n    so that the policy engine will grant admin rights to the request.\n    This behaviour is probably just a waste of resource; also it is not\n    adding anything from a security perspective.\n    \n    On the other hand not performing checks when context.is_admin is\n    True should not pose a security threat either in noauth mode or\n    with the keystone middleware. In the former case the software keeps\n    operating assuming admin rights for every requests, whereas in the\n    latter case the keystone middleware will always supply a context\n    with the appropriate roles, and there is no way for an attacker\n    to trick keystonemiddleware into generating a context for which\n    is_admin=True.\n    \n    Finally, this patch also does some non-trivial changes in test_l3.py\n    as some tests were mocking context.to_dict ignoring the is_admin flag.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1446021\n    \n    Change-Id: I8a5c02712a0b43f3e36a4f14620ebbd73fbfb03f\n\ncommit 89c0875178f22651109a85d3c522d80324368caf\nAuthor: Gal Sagie <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 8 14:27:47 2015 +0300\n\n    Add documentations for VXLAN Tunnels\n    \n    The VXLAN type driver is currently supported, this patch add\n    description and links for more information to the user.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idb221ca4cce1a3a27bebe5ae6fc1e6ab5d030836\n\ncommit e61865807c4c8ff959a7746fe3e17f1ae574c9d0\nAuthor: Kevin Benton <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jun 3 19:03:29 2015 -0700\n\n    Defer segment lookup in NetworkContext object\n    \n    Avoid call to get network segments for network context objects until\n    a caller actually tries to lookup the segments.

To this aim, model_query_scope has been refactored as well.\n    As the model query function being introduced in this patch\n    cannot use model query hooks (and does not need to), the\n    method was re-implemented rather than bringing out of the\n    mixin as it has been done for model_query_scope.\n    \n    This change will allow for developing DB APIs without\n    having to use the

As the project has grown, it's become obvious we\n    need to subdivide responsibilites and merge rights across the\n    repository. The advanced services split [1] was one way in which we did\n    this, and it's proven effective. Plugin decomposition was another [2].\n    As a next step to evolve things, this changes the core reviewer\n    paradigm into a system of Lieutenants, all reporting to the PTL in the\n    project. The Lieutenants will be able to maintain their own core\n    review team. The idea of \"super cores\" will fade away. And we begin to\n    see the benefits of a layered, structured approach to managing\n    Neutron.\n    \n    This proposal makes an attempt to comment on existing core reviewers.\n    While the idea of existing core reviewers being labeled as \"supercores\"\n    has been floated, the reality is a bit more nuanced than that, and I've\n    taken steps to address that with this patch. It should be noted that like\n    all things in Neutron governance, the system is based on a mutual trust.\n    \n    [1] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/kilo/services-split.html\n    [2] http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/neutron-specs/specs/kilo/core-vendor-decomposition.html\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia4060066a300e851172c0fd7a2910ce53a6c649e\n\ncommit 1e0d201f1d71ce48a096f69700e4097e460ee53a\nAuthor: Carl Baldwin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue May 26 20:33:56 2015 +0000\n\n    Isolate use of fixed_ips[0] to avoid confusion\n    \n    I was looking at the assumption around using fixed_ips[0] in a recent\n    patch [1].

When the hash type\n    is 'ip', a CIDR is completely enumerated into all of its\n    addresses so 10.100.0.0/16 results in ~65k entries. This\n    meant a single allowed_address_pairs entry could easily\n    exhaust an entire set.\n    \n    This patch changes the hash type to 'net', which is designed\n    to handle a CIDRs as a single entry.\n    \n    This patch also changes the names of the ipsets because\n    creating an ipset with different parameters will cause an\n    error and our ipset manager code isn't robust enough to handle\n    that at this time. There is another ongoing patch to fix\n    that but it won't be ready in time.[1]\n    \n    The related bug was closed by increasing the set limit, which\n    did alleviate the problem. However, this change would also\n    address the issue because the gate tests run an allowed address\n    pairs extension test with the CIDR mentioned above.\n    \n    1.
