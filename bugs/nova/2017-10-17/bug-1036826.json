The reset command assumes the domain is running in some capacity and will fail if it is not. Here are some steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a new libvirt VM (using qemu for my testing).\n\n2. virsh list # validate it is running\n\nvirsh # list\n Id Name State\n----------------------------------\n  3 instance-00000001 running\n\n3.
