That is not convenient from mocking point of view, as it requires different set of mocks to be places on every method. It is also hard to reason about. Splitting into several meaningful test cases will allow to have mock decorators mostly at class-levels, which will lead to less cluttered code. It will also simplify review for Nova folks.",
