    "description": "There is a column in the ResourceProvider table named 'can_host'. It is used to distinguish compute nodes (can_host=1) from shared storage providers (can_host=0) for queries that need to distinguish those different types of providers. However, the name is very Nova-specific, and when the Placement engine is extended to support a variety of resource allocation requirements, it will probably cause confusion. After a discussion on IRC, we decided to change the name to \"shared\", and reverse any logic using can_host, since can_host=1 will now be shared=0, and vice-versa.",
