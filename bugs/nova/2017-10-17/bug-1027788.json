    "description": "How to reproduce:\n\n1. Run nova-compute service on host on some node. (Specify host field in nova.conf as dotted quad; eg: 192.168.0.3).\n2. Run nova-pythonclient (nova command) with admin credential: nova describe-resource 192.168.03\n3. nova-api fails with 404 response.\n\n\nnova.api.openstack.compute.contrib.hosts.HostController.show method accepts hostname as `id' argument.\n\nIf nova-pythonclient sends id as dotted quad or hostname containing '.', os-hosts/{id} fails with 404 (host not found).\nIt always strips last `.xx' from hostname. (processed by Routes package)\n\nI think os-hosts extension should process '.' like os-floaing-ip-dns (as in nova.api.openstack.compute.contrib.floaing_ip_dns.py).\n\nThis bug currently affects stable branch (stable/essex) and not yet fixed in folsom development branch.",
