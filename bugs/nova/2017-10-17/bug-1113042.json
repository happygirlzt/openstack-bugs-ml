    "description": "The libvirt volume_nfs driver does not pass any mount options (-o). As such, the options become whatever the default of the hypervisor OS/kernel happens to be.  For example, with Ubuntu 12.04, this results in the use of NFS v4. These options can drastically alter the behavior and performance of NFS and should be tunable by an administrator.",
