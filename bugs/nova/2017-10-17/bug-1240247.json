There's at least a couple of bad side effects of this:\n\n1) The instance disappears immediately from API view, even though the instance still exists in the child cell.  The user does not see a 'deleting' task state.  And if the delete fails in the child cell, you have a sync issue until the instance is 'healed'.\n2) Double delete.start and delete.end notifications are sent.  1 from API cell, 1 from child cell.\n\nThe problem seems to be that _local_delete is being called because the service is determined to be down... because the compute service does not run in the API cell.",
