For image backed instances\n    in the libvirt driver, the metadata determines whether quiescing\n    is invoked or not.\n    \n    To make the behaviors consistent, this introduces the same logic\n    as volume backed instances into libvirt image snapshotting.\n    \n    This also fixes AttributeError during live snapshot introduced by\n    commit 4f43bbafa4bfc2ab149d5db4eb55320c1602658b.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iade076c996118e53d085ede9574cdf01c9e97829\n    Closes-Bug: #1436579\n    Closes-Bug: #1488565\n",
