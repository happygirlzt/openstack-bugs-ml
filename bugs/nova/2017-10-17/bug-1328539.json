For every attempted spawn the instance will end up with an additional fixed IP allocated to it. This is because the code is associating the IP, but not disassociating it if the function fails.",

This means that if, for example,\n    _setup_network_on_host fails, the instance will still have a fixed IP\n    allocated to it. Every attempt to spawn the instance will result in\n    another fixed ip being allocated.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1328539\n    \n    Change-Id: Idfa1f4015acb10dc14fcec448257bcfe6971fc99\n",
