He says that the best near-term workaround is to use a command for creating a VM from OVF in order to transfer to the file from Glance/Nova to the datastore, as there is no other public HTTP API that will correctly transfer thin images.  Apparently, the trick will be to create a \"fake VM\", deploy it as OVF, and then remove the \"parent\" VM object from the inventory leaving only the VMDK.   If what I'm saying doesn't make sense, ping Christian and can give you the real details.  ",
