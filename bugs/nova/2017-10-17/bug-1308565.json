If both renaming operations fail, the sequence is\n    repeated, in case the the disk image path initially had the \"_resize\"\n    suffix and another thread removed it before the second rename operation\n    was attempted. These rename operations are used in favor of checking\n    for the existence of paths and deleting if found, because rename\n    operations are atomic whereas another thread could rename the path\n    between the exist check and the deleting.\n    \n    Regardless of the outcome of the renaming operations, the existence of\n    the instance path with the \"_del\" suffix is verified and if it exists,\n    it is deleted. This is done in case a prior delete operation that\n    managed to create the \"_del\" path was subsequently interrupted before\n    all instance files could be deleted.\n    \n    Note that the LibvirtConnTestCase.test_delete_instance_files test case\n    was removed in order to eliminate redundancy.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1308565\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifcb2e18211347ccf3e5472779c5917a729a6eced\n",
