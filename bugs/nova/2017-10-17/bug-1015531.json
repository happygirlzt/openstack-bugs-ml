By requesting files to be injected in malicious paths, a remote authenticated user could inject files in arbitrary locations on the host file system, potentially resulting in full compromise of the compute node. Only Essex and later setups running the OpenStack API over libvirt-based hypervisors are affected.\n\nUpon further inspection of the code, P\u00e1draig Brady from RedHat found an additional vulnerability.
