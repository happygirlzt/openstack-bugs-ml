    "description": "for openstack kilo version, when creating a instance,   libvirt creates cirrus video type in template xml file  while is not supported for  PPC64 little endian system.  I debug the code and finally find mistake in function _add_video_driver of file nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py\nIn function,  there is a logic that video driver is determinded by guest arch.   If arch is in (PPC, PPC64) then return vga, otherwise video driver is determined by other options.  For PPC64 little endian system,  guest arch is PPC64LE so that video driver is determined by other option (In our environment, with kvm virt type and spice disabled , video driver is determined by hw_video_model)  which makes video driver is cirrus .  Exception happens when creating vm instance because cirrus video driver is not supported on power hardware.\nI  add PPC64LE arch in the guestarch option and it does works.   The patch will be attached.",
