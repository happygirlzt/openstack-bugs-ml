We need to return a error stating\n\"Paused instance can't be migrated when post copy is enabled\" to give better user experience\n\nActual result\n=============\nLive migration command returns 202  but I could see libvirt failure compute logs.\n\nEnvironment:\n\nMultinode devstack environment with 2 compute nodes.\n1)Current master\n2)Networking-neutron\n3)Hypervisor Libvirt-KVM\n3) Enable post copy for which libvirt version should be greater than  or equal to 1.3.3.\n\nLogs:\nFollowing error found in compute log\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/601362/",
