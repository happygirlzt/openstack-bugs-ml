This info is then stored in nova's block-device-mapping table and is never re-validated down the line. \nChanging the Ceph mon servers' IP adresses will prevent the instance from booting as the stale connection info will enter the instance's XML. One idea to fix this would be to use the information from ceph.conf, which should be an alias or a loadblancer, directly.",
