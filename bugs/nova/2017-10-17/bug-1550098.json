I don't want to step over your solution on this problem. If you are stuck on this bug, do you want to transfer it to me?\n\nA possible solution: to test in https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/scheduler/host_manager.py#L205 if free_gb is None. If it is, assign free_gb = least_gb. What do you think?",

It moves the \"least_disk_mb\" calculation to disk_filter, so free_disk_mb in host manager is now consistent with the resource tracker \"free_disk_gb\".\n\nIf it doesn't fix the error in gate-tempest-dsvm-neutron-identity-v3-only-full-ubuntu-xenial-nv, feel free to upload your version :)",
