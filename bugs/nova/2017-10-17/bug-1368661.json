And in the\n    case of EC HEADs it will set it to ndata.\n    The proxy will then serve only the first valid source to respond.\n    This applies to all account, container and object GETs except\n    for EC. For EC only HEAD requests are effected.\n    \n    It achieves this by changing the request sending mechanism to using\n    GreenAsyncPile and green threads with a time out between each\n    request.\n    \n    'concurrency_timeout' is related to concurrent_gets. And is the\n    amount of time to wait before firing the next thread. A value of 0\n    will fire at the same time (fully concurrent), setting another value\n    will stagger the firing allowing you the ability to give a node a\n    shorter chance to respond before firing the next. This value is a float\n    and should be somewhere between 0 and node_timeout. The default is\n    conn_timeout. Meaning by default it will stagger the firing.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Implements: blueprint concurrent-reads\n    Change-Id: I789d39472ec48b22415ff9d9821b1eefab7da867\n\ncommit 9e90d309621584be173b9be7ac91c469a013ab96\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Mar 14 06:13:37 2016 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: I30d06a1d96d4bd0e2e4972cb8ede7ebc08beae2d\n\ncommit a537684c77a2e91c0cc6e4c4953a7e993f6a7005\nAuthor: Brian Cline <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Mar 14 00:17:47 2016 -0500\n\n    Don't report recon mount/usage status on files\n    \n    Today recon will include normal files in the payload it returns for\n    /recon/unmounted and /recon/diskusage.

Pending\n    file names were derived from the update request's x-timestamp,\n    which is equal to the object's data file timestamp. This meant\n    that updates due to an object POST used the same async pending\n    file as updates due to the object's PUT.\n    \n    This is not so bad because the object POST update has a superset\n    of the metadata included in the PUT update. But there is a risk\n    of a race condition causing an update to be lost: the updater may\n    open an update file due to a PUT whuile the object server is\n    writing an update due to a POST to the same file name. The\n    updater could then unlink the file before the more recent update\n    for the POST is sent.\n    \n    This patch changes the POST update pending file name to be derived\n    from the object's metadata timestamp, thus making it distinct from\n    the PUT update pending file name.

It does\n    not move any data nor does it exposes a CLI command yet; it is only intended to\n    be used in a future version to do the actual ring modification itself.\n    \n    An existing object that is currently located on partition X will be placed\n    either on partition 2*X or 2*X+1 after the partition power got increased. The\n    reason for this is the Ring.get_part() method, that does a bitwise shift to the\n    right.\n    \n    To avoid actual data movement to different disks or even nodes, the allocation\n    of partitions to nodes needs to be changed. The allocation is pairwise due to\n    the above mentioned new partition scheme. Therefore devices are allocated like\n    this, with the partition being the index and the value being the device id:\n    \n    OLD: 0,    3,    7,    5,    2,    1,    ...\n    NEW: 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, ...\n    \n    If an operator stops the cluster, increases the partition power and renames &\n    hardlinks the existing data it is possible to do a power shift without actually\n    moving data. Please see the partition power spec for further details on this.\n    \n    Change-Id: I063fd8077497ee8c14d9065f07b4ec0fb5cbe180\n    Partially-Implements: spec increasing_partition_power\n\ncommit 09c73b86e9255f28fbd4cf571a52c17d549a8f9a\nAuthor: Pete Zaitcev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Mar 3 10:24:28 2016 -0700\n\n    Fix a crash in exception printout\n    \n    Says the number of arguments does not match the number of '%'.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8b5e395a07328fb9d4ac7a19f8ed2ae1637bee3b\n\ncommit 6b4e73bb15c680ada8b30279b090c6123ce5731f\nAuthor: Charles Hsu <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Feb 25 13:31:51 2016 +0800\n\n    Fix account-reaper unable to delete all containers.\n    \n    When reaper try to find the correct container_shard number,\n    but it doesn't compare local device's name, so it always\n    return first entry's index of local devices from the ring\n    to container_shard.\n    That causes some containers will be skip and objects under\n    these containers won't be delete.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0e2bbdd99add86ee46e856920c0740c4aa13c77d\n    Closes-Bug: #1549615\n\ncommit 22685d6231003bd236e7fc363b58e86f35ab80bb\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Mar 1 13:54:09 2016 +0000\n\n    Faster suffix invalidations on object PUT/DELETE\n    \n    Before this commit, we performed a full read-modify-write cycle on a\n    partition's hashes.pkl to invalidate the relevant suffix whenever an\n    object PUT or DELETE completes.\n    \n    Now we append invalid suffixes to a new file, \"hashes.invalid\",\n    alongside hashes.pkl.

(You might try, but you can't do that even today.)\n    As a result, this seems to have no ill effect on anything, but is a\n    huge help for linters.\n    \n    This doesn't seem to break any unit tests, func tests via v1, v2, and\n    v3 auth, nor tempest tests via v2 or v3.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id28fb56bc7133b9eb59df7989a71b892fd919643\n\ncommit 14eb1803e931c5c501d99e612a6d59a57eccf464\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 23:57:49 2016 -0700\n\n    Fix probe failure and small things\n    \n    This is follow up for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/283351/.\n    \n    Probe fix:\n    - The probe in the patch now fails (sometimes success luckily)\n      because inbound X-Timestamp is deprecated at the change,\n      f581fccf71034818d19062593eeb52a4347bb174, so we can not use\n      X-Timestamp to make an object with arbitrary timestamp anymore\n      from outside of Swift.

It \"accidently\" works with TempAuth\n    because it requires a reseller permission, so the Keystone failure here\n    has more to do with not requiring a reseller permission to do a PUT on a\n    storage account for which a user has an operator role on.\n    \n    The common sense fix here is to not execute this test case when\n    allow_account_management is enabled.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id29f5ca48f92cd139535be7064107b8a61b02856\n\ncommit 1c88d2cb818cec07d12ac17be5820cdd769aea5d\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Feb 11 15:51:45 2016 -0800\n\n    Fix up get_account_info and get_container_info\n    \n    get_account_info used to work like this:\n    \n      * make an account HEAD request\n    \n      * ignore the response\n    \n      * get the account info by digging around in the request environment,\n        where it had been deposited by elves or something\n    \n    Not actually elves, but the proxy's GETorHEAD_base method would take\n    the HEAD response and cache it in the response environment, which was\n    the same object as the request environment, thus enabling\n    get_account_info to find it.\n    \n    This was extraordinarily brittle. If a WSGI middleware were to\n    shallow-copy the request environment, then any middlewares to its left\n    could not use get_account_info, as the left middleware's request\n    environment would no longer be identical to the response environment\n    down in GETorHEAD_base.\n    \n    Now, get_account_info works like this:\n    \n      * make an account HEAD request.\n    \n      * if the account info is in the request environment, return it. This\n        is an optimization to avoid a double-set in memcached.\n    \n      * else, compute the account info from the response headers, store it\n        in caches, and return it.\n    \n    This is much easier to think about; get_account_info can get and cache\n    account info all on its own; the cache check and cache set are right\n    next to each other.\n    \n    All the above is true for get_container_info as well.\n    \n    get_info() is still around, but it's just a shim. It was trying to\n    unify get_account_info and get_container_info to exploit the\n    commonalities, but the number of times that \"if container:\" showed up\n    in get_info and its helpers really indicated that something was\n    wrong. I'd rather have two functions with some duplication than one\n    function with no duplication but a bunch of \"if container:\" branches.\n    \n    Other things of note:\n    \n      * a HEAD request to a deleted account returns 410, but\n        get_account_info would return 404 since the 410 came from the\n        account controller *after* GETorHEAD_base ran. Now\n        get_account_info returns 410 as well.\n    \n      * cache validity period (recheck_account_existence and\n        recheck_container_existence) is now communicated to\n        get_account_info via an X-Backend header. This way,\n        get_account_info doesn't need a reference to the\n        swift.proxy.server.Application object.\n    \n      * both logged swift_source values are now correct for\n        get_container_info calls; before, on a cold cache,\n        get_container_info would call get_account_info but not pass along\n        swift_source, resulting in get_account_info logging \"GET_INFO\" as\n        the source. Amusingly, there was a unit test asserting this bogus\n        behavior.\n    \n      * callers that modify the return value of get_account_info or of\n        get_container_info don't modify what's stored in swift.infocache.\n    \n      * get_account_info on an account that *can* be autocreated but has\n        not been will return a 200, same as a HEAD request. The old\n        behavior was a 404 from get_account_info but a 200 from\n        HEAD. Callers can tell the difference by looking at\n        info['account_really_exists'] if they need to know the difference\n        (there is one call site that needs to know, in container\n        PUT). Note: this is for all accounts when the proxy's\n        \"account_autocreate\" setting is on.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5167714025ec7237f7e6dd4759c2c6eb959b3fca\n\ncommit ce90a1e79e16472ff75d205c8d907a5991888b3a\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jan 21 13:19:30 2016 -0800\n\n    Make info caching work across subrequests\n    \n    Previously, if you called get_account_info, get_container_info, or\n    get_object_info, then the results of that call would be cached in the\n    WSGI environment as top-level keys. This is okay, except that if you,\n    in middleware, copy the WSGI environment and then make a subrequest\n    using the copy, information retrieved in the subrequest is cached\n    only in the copy and not in the original. This can mean lots of extra\n    trips to memcache for, say, SLO validation where the segments are in\n    another container; the object HEAD ends up getting container info for\n    the segment container, but then the next object HEAD gets it again.\n    \n    This commit moves the cache for get_*_info into a dictionary at\n    environ['swift.infocache']; this way, you can shallow-copy the request\n    environment and still get the benefits from the cache.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3481b38b41c33cd1e39e19baab56193c5f9bf6ac\n\ncommit 30e39cc9fa6353be37cd3b5a515f09b42ceb3b20\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed May 4 12:02:07 2016 -0700\n\n    Skip SLO-reconciling probe test when SLO is off\n    \n    The probe test in question tries to make a manifest referencing\n    unavailable objects and expects that to fail with a 400. If the SLO\n    middleware is enabled, then it checks the segments, can't find some,\n    and returns the 400. If it's disabled, the PUT succeeds and makes an\n    object whose contents are some JSON blob. In the latter case, the\n    probe test would fail because it expected a real SLO manifest but\n    didn't find one.\n    \n    Now we skip the remainder of the test when we detect that SLO is not\n    enabled.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3e7e8e98107608e675efc24156e703bc167458bb\n\ncommit 721c788b9a0ceb22ffac0b2c797890898096a9f4\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 18:57:31 2016 -0700\n\n    Import BrainSpliter directly in expirer probe\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib3cfe38d1b17c09c7248b5cbcfe4e2eadff7acd9\n\ncommit eda1b330f3cf7bf9dd643854d4a221b6f024884d\nAuthor: Paul Dardeau <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 18:58:15 2016 +0000\n\n    fix docs word usage for large obj copy\n    \n    Change-Id: I2b6ca3f9277b344ff5b05a85304084a7edcbcb66\n\ncommit 6834547f668a4649f5a42b8a4edc43b844fd6bbe\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Apr 22 14:55:35 2016 -0700\n\n    Clean up fallocate tests a little\n    \n    Change-Id: I01f1ad8ef0f8910718fd2fb30c9e8285358baf84\n\ncommit b430c384db38ea1153f52d0accf0561dac1378a6\nAuthor: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 14:57:56 2016 +0100\n\n    Put back missing sysmeta unit tests\n    \n    We lost some unit tests from test_sysmeta.py in [1].\n    This patch restores them.

COPY is no longer\n    a verb implemented as public method in Proxy application.\n    \n    The server side copy middleware is inserted to the left of dlo, slo and\n    versioned_writes middlewares in the proxy server pipeline. As a result,\n    dlo and slo copy_hooks are no longer required. SLO manifests are now\n    validated when copied so when copying a manifest to another account the\n    referenced segments must be readable in that account for the manifest\n    copy to succeed (previously this validation was not made, meaning the\n    manifest was copied but could be unusable if the segments were not\n    readable).\n    \n    With this change, there should be no change in functionality or existing\n    behavior.

This is because expirer\n    sends a request with \"X-Timestamp: <current_timestamp>\" and tombstone\n    is named as <requested_x_timestamp>.ts so if object creation time is\n    between x-delete-at and expirer's DELETE request x-timestamp, the object\n    might be hidden by tombstone.\n    \n    This possibility can be simply removed if the value of x-timestamp which\n    an expirer sends is the same timestamp as x-delete-at of an actual object.\n    Namely, expirer pretends to delete an object at the time an user really\n    wants to delete it.\n    \n    Change-Id: I53e343f4e73b0b1c4ced9a3bc054541473d26cf8\n    Closes-Bug: #1546067\n\ncommit b13a85367ef7f5fd64e285174859025d34b4e451\nAuthor: Thiago da Silva <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Dec 21 16:25:45 2015 -0200\n\n    decouple versioned writes from COPY\n    \n    This change removes the use of the COPY request in the versioned\n    writes middleware. It changes the COPY verb for GETs and PUTs\n    requests. The main reasoning for this change is to remove any\n    dependency that versioning had on copy, which will allow for the COPY\n    functionality to be moved to middleware and to be to the left of the\n    versioned writes middleware in the proxy pipeline. In this way,\n    no COPY request will ever arrive at the versioned writes middleware.\n    \n    A side benefit of this change is that it removes a HEAD request from\n    the PUT path. Instead of checking if a current version exists, a\n    GET request is sent, in case of success, a PUT is sent to the\n    versions container.\n    \n    A unit test was removed that tested non-default storage policies.\n    This test is no longer necessary, since it was used to test\n    specific policy handling code in the COPY method in the proxy\n    object controller.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1365862\n    \n    Change-Id: Idf34fa8d04ff292df7134b6d4aa94ff40887b3a4\n    Co-Authored-By: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Janie Richling <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\n    Signed-off-by: Thiago da Silva <email address hidden>\n\ncommit 33f06dc48f7bec2e128b44427fb429ad640cd486\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sat Apr 9 18:47:58 2016 +0200\n\n    Fixed Sphinx errors\n    \n    doc/source/deployment_guide.rst:1372: ERROR: Malformed table.\n    swift/obj/diskfile.py:docstring of swift.obj.diskfile.BaseDiskFileManager.yield_hashes:13: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.\n    doc/source/ops_runbook/diagnose.rst:188: WARNING: Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id20eb62eb5baebb3814e7af5676badb94f17dee5\n\ncommit a829bd59770681f9d6c1ef02a6e1d5e441587a23\nAuthor: Tin Lam <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Apr 8 18:40:30 2016 -0500\n\n    Convert CONTRIBUTING.md to CONTRIBUTING.rst\n    \n    Change-Id: I64c42c42db35a9f55a1df9d4ab6e97a2506b8c45\n    Closes-Bug: #1567027\n\ncommit a057c409ec8a23290bc72c4fa45d55a1178f4828\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Apr 8 07:02:33 2016 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: I9f4330ec20463e4d303e8ba3b67f86813a914ac5\n\ncommit d09ef0da62b64067b04a980c643f77526a9078ac\nAuthor: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 6 15:40:42 2016 +0100\n\n    Assert that ChunkWriteTimouts are not raised\n    \n    Follow up for change Ibbc89449e7878fc4215e47e3f7dfe4ae58a2d638\n    to add a test assertion that the ChunkWriteTimeout contexts are\n    exited without raising the timeout exception in\n    iter_bytes_from_response_part().\n    \n    Change-Id: I6d323cb26779e457fb5940093a81b349b333a0af\n\ncommit 7c0f58ec2ed020186ca3f269153b184fc02bf37a\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Apr 7 07:00:08 2016 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib80e3a759fa1e4a99576710607ad07fc5f259527\n\ncommit edc413b85ec2b703d7506be9c4801eb347611c58\nAuthor: Nguyen Hung Phuong <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Apr 7 13:31:26 2016 +0700\n\n    Fix typos in Swift files\n    \n    Change-Id: I39dbf55c094c42347b57ef67520abff9e6fc24bc\n\ncommit 95efd3f9035ec4141e1b182516f040a59a3e5aa6\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Mar 23 13:51:47 2016 -0700\n\n    Fix infinite recursion during logging when syslog is down\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia9ecffc88ce43616977e141498e5ee404f2c29c4\n\ncommit 0bf518e3b0eeaf66653db6972525701cacfe6333\nAuthor: Thiago da Silva <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 6 16:58:36 2016 -0400\n\n    remove unused current_status method\n    \n    Change-Id: I574919eaa14cadc800f3a1f6014221ee382ee7e0\n    Signed-off-by: Thiago da Silva <email address hidden>\n\ncommit 5d56f40f04fa9211a2e392d667fe395f38d2cca5\nAuthor: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 6 11:48:48 2016 +0100\n\n    Make DirectClientException report correct ip and port\n    \n    When direct_client.direct_get_suffix_hashes raises a\n    DirectClientException the exception message and variables\n    should report the replication_ip and replication_port, as\n    opposed to the ip and port values reported for all other\n    case when the exception is raised.\n    \n    Add option to override ip and port reported in\n    DirectClientException.\n    \n    Also adds unit tests to verify both cases.\n    \n    Related-Bug: 1566395\n    Change-Id: If3d952847c7199f4e9f6164858085367266386d2\n\ncommit e15bceaa7e541c77f26a1f11ee2cbddbc871cbf1\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Dec 21 03:13:50 2015 -0800\n\n    Refactor CORS unit tests\n    \n    This is a follow-up patch for https://review.openstack.org/#/c/258392/\n    That one added good unit test cases for various kinds of\n    allowe_origin like '*' or ''(empty).

And in the\n    case of EC HEADs it will set it to ndata.\n    The proxy will then serve only the first valid source to respond.\n    This applies to all account, container and object GETs except\n    for EC. For EC only HEAD requests are effected.\n    \n    It achieves this by changing the request sending mechanism to using\n    GreenAsyncPile and green threads with a time out between each\n    request.\n    \n    'concurrency_timeout' is related to concurrent_gets. And is the\n    amount of time to wait before firing the next thread. A value of 0\n    will fire at the same time (fully concurrent), setting another value\n    will stagger the firing allowing you the ability to give a node a\n    shorter chance to respond before firing the next.

Pending\n    file names were derived from the update request's x-timestamp,\n    which is equal to the object's data file timestamp. This meant\n    that updates due to an object POST used the same async pending\n    file as updates due to the object's PUT.\n    \n    This is not so bad because the object POST update has a superset\n    of the metadata included in the PUT update. But there is a risk\n    of a race condition causing an update to be lost: the updater may\n    open an update file due to a PUT whuile the object server is\n    writing an update due to a POST to the same file name. The\n    updater could then unlink the file before the more recent update\n    for the POST is sent.\n    \n    This patch changes the POST update pending file name to be derived\n    from the object's metadata timestamp, thus making it distinct from\n    the PUT update pending file name. There is no upgrade impact since\n    existing pending files will continue to be processed.\n    \n    Change-Id: I1b093c837efe8c2a64e92075ebd5e1b93e30efb9\n\ncommit 82c8023b894aa7a1fe12fbf1efbfad47afdf86b3\nAuthor: Mahati Chamarthy <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Mar 8 19:01:53 2016 +0530\n\n    remove hash_cleanup_listdir legacy translation method\n    \n    Change-Id: I0b96dfde32b4c666eebda6e88228516dd693ef92\n    closes-bug:#1550569\n\ncommit 9430f4c9f5e79026f7275f8ec32ef4a180c5e8fc\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Mar 2 10:28:51 2016 +0000\n\n    Move HeaderKeyDict to avoid an inline import\n    \n    There was a function in swift.common.utils that was importing\n    swob.HeaderKeyDict at call time.

This can result in possible reconstruction of the\n    fragment archive (for a sync job) and definite transmission\n    of the fragment archive (for sync and revert jobs), which is\n    wasteful.\n    \n    This patch makes the ssync receiver inspect the diskfile\n    state after attempting to open it, and if fragments exist at\n    the timestamp of the sender's diskfile, but a .durable file\n    is missing, then the receiver will commit the diskfile at\n    the sender's timestamp.

It does\n    not move any data nor does it exposes a CLI command yet; it is only intended to\n    be used in a future version to do the actual ring modification itself.\n    \n    An existing object that is currently located on partition X will be placed\n    either on partition 2*X or 2*X+1 after the partition power got increased. The\n    reason for this is the Ring.get_part() method, that does a bitwise shift to the\n    right.\n    \n    To avoid actual data movement to different disks or even nodes, the allocation\n    of partitions to nodes needs to be changed. The allocation is pairwise due to\n    the above mentioned new partition scheme. Therefore devices are allocated like\n    this, with the partition being the index and the value being the device id:\n    \n    OLD: 0,    3,    7,    5,    2,    1,    ...\n    NEW: 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 7, 5, 5, 2, 2, 1, 1, ...\n    \n    If an operator stops the cluster, increases the partition power and renames &\n    hardlinks the existing data it is possible to do a power shift without actually\n    moving data.

This leads to not\n    calling fallocate (details on bug) on a PUT since the size is 0.\n    \n    This change makes use of some numbers returned from the EC Driver\n    get_segment_info method in order to calculate the expected on-disk\n    size that should be allocated.  The EC controller will now set the\n    'X-Backend-Obj-Content-Length' value appropriately.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Kota Tsuyuzaki\n    Co-Authored-By: John Dickinson\n    Co-Authored-By: Tim Burke\n    Change-Id: Ifd16c1438539e6fd9bb2dbcd053d11bea2e09fee\n    Fixes: bug 1532008\n\ncommit 7aaca029175661d45d05d41cce367c0ae19cab41\nAuthor: Christian Schwede <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Feb 11 13:18:07 2016 +0100\n\n    Add comments to role-based access control functional tests\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic18c8a2abc33e2f175f948991af0189935b8702f\n\ncommit 335d58611d0daf87783e565b521974b456f5c636\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Dec 15 22:42:18 2015 +0100\n\n    Keystone middleware deprecated option is_admin removed\n    \n    It has been deprecated from Swift 1.8.0 (Grizzly)\n    \n    Change-Id: Id6bc10c3e84262c0a9e6160a76af03c0ad363e9c\n\ncommit ceaaedbe4057542e374200673dd323ba64bb42eb\nAuthor: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Mar 11 11:22:53 2015 +0000\n\n    Make functional tests tolerate pre-existing versioned container\n    \n    test/functional/tests.py:TestAccount.testAccountHead relies\n    on the account having a known number of containers.
