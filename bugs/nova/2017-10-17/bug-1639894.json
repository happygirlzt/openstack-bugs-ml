That happens after the two swap-volume notifications\n    are sent (for start and error).\n    \n    The test was asserting a 5th notification for the generic\n    instance fault, which happens, but might not happen before\n    the CinderFixture flag is set and the test checks for 5\n    notifications.\n    \n    This test really only cares that there are the two swap-volume\n    notifications, so to avoid a race this change just makes\n    the test assert that there are at least 4 versioned notifications\n    by the time the swap-volume error occurs, which is all it was\n    checking after that anyway.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8fd44b083f109c034958a305a4e41f9d810c4389\n    Closes-Bug: #1639894\n",
