Running this in the cinder DB: \"DELETE FROM volumes;\"\n3. Running this in the cinder DB: \"UPDATE volumes SET status='error';\"\n4. Running this in the cinder DB: \"UPDATE volumes SET attach_status='foo';\"\n\nNone of them create an undeleteable instance. Any other tips about how to reproduce this? I'd tend to think that we should lower this from \"high\" severity as a result of my testing.",
