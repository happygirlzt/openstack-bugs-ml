If this parameter is set to \"True\" in the REST API call to create multiple servers [1], The response will contain one reservation ID which can be used to query for all servers which match this [2]. \n\nMaybe this solves your current problem, but I agree that I would expect a list of servers too. I can only assume that this solution got chosen because it could take a while to launch all, lets say 40 servers, and the REST API would have to wait until this is done to send a response which contains the server details of all 40 servers.\n\nOpen Questions\n==============\nDoes anyone from the API subteam have a more profound answer?\n\nReferences\n==========\n[1] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/multiple_create.py?id=f1524dfbcd32b61116d4eb80b269272e60811cef#n26\n[2] https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py?id=f1524dfbcd32b61116d4eb80b269272e60811cef#n1107",
