Mentioning this in the\n    description for that config setting.\n    \n    ServerGroupAffinity is a scheduler setting that places all\n    servers with the group on the same host. (It is the opposite\n    of AntiAffinity that PREVENTS them from being on the same\n    host.) Consequently, if you try to resize a server that is\n    in an Affinity group (ie, it is affined) it will fail as the\n    current rules IMMEDIATELY remove the current server from\n    the list of possible scheduling targets (unless you have enabled\n    \"allow_resize_to_same_host\".) Since none of the other servers\n    can be candidates because of the Affinity rule, the resize\n    fails entirely.\n    \n    Change-Id: I77a90ffdfe465d99ee8596375430ee960048d566\n    Closes-Bug: #1660090\n",
