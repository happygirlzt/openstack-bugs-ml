Nova currently only returns a 403 when it runs into a policy\n    exception from its own policy (which is a subclass of Forbidden). This\n    changes the handler over to return a 403 when any Forbidden comes in.\n    \n    Also, the volume helper methods in the function API client had incorrect\n    URLs, so those were also fixed (/volumes --> /os-volumes)\n    \n    Change-Id: If9dd002454338d07fcea0c2092c12f3961c3dcdf\n    Partial-Bug: #1554631\n    Closes-Bug: #1555826\n",
