This sometimes causes the gate to timeout as the combined time of building the environment, running the tests, and gathering the information can be too much (despite all the tests passing).\n\nThe problem appears to be a deadlock/race in eventlet itself when working with the same file from different greenthreads.\n\nsee email for more discussion: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-March/089496.html\n\na fix is proposed and will be linked here momentarily",
