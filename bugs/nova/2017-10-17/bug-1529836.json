This could be observed via strace as a\n    socket that had shutdown() called on it, but was never closed. It\n    could also be observed by counting entries in /proc/<pid>/fd, where\n    <pid> is the pid of a proxy server worker process.\n    \n    This is due to a memory leak in SegmentedIterable. A SegmentedIterable\n    has an 'app_iter' attribute, which is a generator. That generator\n    references 'self' (the SegmentedIterable object). This creates a\n    cyclic reference: the generator refers to the SegmentedIterable, and\n    the SegmentedIterable refers to the generator.\n    \n    Python can normally handle cyclic garbage; reference counting won't\n    reclaim it, but the garbage collector will. However, objects with\n    finalizers will stop the garbage collector from collecting them* and\n    the cycle of which they are part.\n    \n    For most objects, \"has finalizer\" is synonymous with \"has a __del__\n    method\". However, a generator has a finalizer once it's started\n    running and before it finishes: basically, while it has stack frames\n    associated with it**.\n    \n    When a client disconnects mid-stream, we get a memory leak. We have\n    our SegmentedIterable object (call it \"si\"), and its associated\n    generator. si.app_iter is the generator, and the generator closes over\n    si, so we have a cycle; and the generator has started but not yet\n    finished, so the generator needs finalization; hence, the garbage\n    collector won't ever clean it up.\n    \n    The socket leak comes in because the generator *also* refers to the\n    request's WSGI environment, which contains wsgi.input, which\n    ultimately refers to a _socket object from the standard\n    library. Python's _socket objects only close their underlying file\n    descriptor when their reference counts fall to 0***.\n    \n    This commit makes SegmentedIterable.close() call\n    self.app_iter.close(), thereby unwinding its generator's stack and\n    making it eligible for garbage collection.\n    \n    * in Python < 3.4, at least. See PEP 442.\n    \n    ** see PyGen_NeedsFinalizing() in Objects/genobject.c and also\n       has_finalizer() in Modules/gcmodule.c in Python.\n    \n    *** see sock_dealloc() in Modules/socketmodule.c in Python.

Users\n    would have to just use it until it stopped working, then re-auth.\n    Now, a successful auth response will include a new header,\n    X-Auth-Token-Expires, with the number of seconds remaining until the\n    token is invalid. This allows the client to attempt to re-auth before\n    sending a request that will definitely fail.\n    \n    For comparison, swauth already uses the X-Auth-Token-Expires header with\n    identical semantics. Additionally, Keystone (v2 and v3) already exposes\n    expiration times in its JSON responses. The security impact should be\n    minimal.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5a4a74276bc0df6dda94e4bc150065c0d77de0eb\n\ncommit 47e226418bad35ccad2a1525f392ba69f6165027\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jan 18 06:20:14 2016 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic416c9afc8a1c76f552803a7c70fc905eda7b3cb\n\ncommit 5d449471b12c67b31ebb5a383d9bb35bace36213\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jan 14 17:26:01 2016 -0800\n\n    Remove some Python 2.6 leftovers\n    \n    Change-Id: I798d08722c90327c66759aa0bb4526851ba38d41\n\ncommit 3c0cf549f1e822cce8f905b069b317e676cf306b\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jan 13 18:08:45 2016 -0800\n\n    Speed up get_more_nodes() when there is an empty zone\n    \n    The ring has some optimizations in get_more_nodes() so that it can\n    find handoffs that span all the regions/zones/et cetera and then stop\n    looking. The stopping is the important part.\n    \n    Previously, it would quickly find a handoff in each unused region,\n    then spend way too long looking for more unused regions; the same was\n    true for zones, IPs, and so on. Thus, in commit 9cd7c6c, we started\n    counting regions and zones, then stopping when we found them all.\n    \n    This count included all regions and zones in the ring, regardless of\n    whether or not there were actually any parts assigned or not. In rings\n    with an empty region, i.e. a region for which there are only\n    zero-weight devices, get_more_nodes() would be very slow.\n    \n    This commit ignores devices with no assigned partitions when counting\n    regions, zones, and so forth, thus greatly speeding things up.\n    \n    The output of get_more_nodes() is unchanged. This is purely an\n    optimization.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1534303\n    \n    Change-Id: I4a5c57205e87e1205d40fd5d9458d4114e524332\n\ncommit 70047709fc9885df7019f791e17a3240682cc6cb\nAuthor: keliang <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jan 15 00:31:51 2016 +0800\n\n    Drop python 2.6 support\n    \n    Change-Id: Id6329c863dacb189fccfc304453ed7b6f9607c14\n\ncommit a4c2fe95ab2fbe59379a69914ed0fac49c28efbb\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jan 12 21:26:33 2016 +0100\n\n    Allow to change auditor sleep interval in config\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic451c5e0b686509f8982ed1bf65a223a2d77b9a0\n\ncommit edc823e8030640184071fee4920d34f9a1cc6b3e\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Nov 29 18:46:47 2015 +0100\n\n    Show UTC time in swift-recon.\n    \n    It's not consistent now for example local time in replication part and\n    UTC time at begging of line.

The changes are around address handling.\n    Namely, if a server is specified with an address\n    [<address>]:port (port is optional), it is assumed to be an IPv6\n    address [1]. If an IPv6 address is specified without \"[]\", an exception\n    is raised as it is impossible to parse such addresses correctly.\n    \n    For testing, memcache can be configured to listen on the link-local,\n    unique-local, or ::1 (equivalent to 127.0.0.1) addresses. Link-local\n    addresses are assigned by default to each interface and are of the form\n    \"fe80::dead:beef\". These addresses require a scope ID, which would look\n    like \"fe80::dead:beef%eth0\" (replacing eth0 with the correct interface).\n    \n    Unique-local addresses are any addresses in the fc00::/7 subnet. To add\n    a ULA to an interface use the \"ip\" utility. For example:\n    \"ip -6 address add fc01::dead:beef dev eth0\".

However, if you're doing something like assembling a\n    video of short clips out of a larger one, then you might not need a\n    full 1 MiB.\n    \n    The reason for the 1 MiB restriction was to protect Swift from\n    resource overconsumption. It takes CPU, RAM, and internal bandwidth to\n    connect to an object server, so it's much cheaper to serve a 10 GiB\n    SLO if it has 10 MiB segments than if it has 10 B segments.\n    \n    Instead of a strict limit, now we apply ratelimiting to small\n    segments. The threshold for \"small\" is configurable and defaults to 1\n    MiB. SLO segments may now be as small as 1 byte.\n    \n    If a client makes SLOs as before, it'll still be able to download the\n    objects as fast as Swift can serve them. However, a SLO with a lot of\n    small ranges or segments will be slowed down to avoid resource\n    overconsumption. This is similar to how DLOs work, except that DLOs\n    ratelimit *every* segment, not just small ones.\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    \n    For operators: if your cluster has enabled ratelimiting for SLO, you\n    will want to set rate_limit_under_size to a large number prior to\n    upgrade. This will preserve your existing behavior of ratelimiting all\n    SLO segments. 5368709123 is a good value, as that's 1 greater than the\n    default max object size. Alternately, hold down the 9 key until you\n    get bored.\n    \n    If your cluster has not enabled ratelimiting for SLO (the default), no\n    action is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id1ff7742308ed816038a5c44ec548afa26612b95\n\ncommit 73d0f1620a269f990dbd3d2796abf27e9a05e227\nAuthor: B\u00e9la Vancsics <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Dec 8 10:17:08 2015 +0100\n\n    Not used parameter\n    \n    The account variable was not used in the method.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8e91d7616529f33b615bc52af76bfda01141d364\n",

This is to be\n      consistent with replication that will leave a later .meta\n      file in place when replicating a .data file.\n    \n    * the diskfile interface is modified to provide accessor\n      methods for the content-type and its timestamp.\n    \n    * the naming of .meta files is modified to encode two\n      timestamps when the .meta file contains a content-type value\n      that was set prior to the latest metadata update; this\n      enables consistency to be achieved when rsync is used for\n      replication.\n    \n    * ssync is modified to sync meta files when content-type\n      differs between local and remote copies of objects.\n    \n    * the object server issues container updates when handling\n      POST requests, notifying the container server of the current\n      immutable metadata (etag, size, hash, swift_bytes),\n      content-type with their respective timestamps, and the\n      mutable metadata timestamp.\n    \n    * the container

The POST at t4 was\n    rejected by A.)\n    \n    After ssync replication the two ondisk file sets will not be\n    consistent:\n    \n      A has t2.ts  (ssync cannot POST t4.meta to this node)\n      B has t2.ts, t4.meta (ssync should not delete t4.meta,\n                            there may be a t3.data somewhere)\n    \n    Consequenty the two nodes will report different hashes for the\n    object's suffix, and replication will repeat, always with the\n    inconsistent outcome. This scenario is reproduced by the probe\n    test added in this patch.\n    \n    (Note that rsync replication does result in (t2.ts, t4.meta)\n    on both nodes.)\n    \n    The solution is to change the way that suffix hashes are\n    calculated. Currently the names of *all* files found in each\n    object dir are added to the hash.  With this patch the\n    timestamps of only those files that could be used to\n    construct a valid diskfile are added to the hash. File\n    extensions are appended to the timestamp so that in most\n    'normal' situations the result of the hashing is the same\n    as before this patch. That avoids a storm of hash mismatches\n    when this patch is deployed in an existing cluster.\n    \n    In the problem case described above, t4.meta is no longer\n    added to the hash, since it is not useful for constructing\n    a diskfile. (Note that t4.meta is not deleted because it\n    may become useful should a t3.data be replicated in future).\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1534276\n    Change-Id: I99e88b8d5f5d9bc22b42112a99634ba942415e05\n\ncommit ddeb0cde9fc828fa79dce90df4975f66737ba054\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Feb 17 21:17:34 2016 -0800\n\n    Fix object-server to handle newer ts file\n    \n    Swift object-server will return 409 Conflict when the incomming\n    request X-Timestamp is older than the local disk file to prevent\n    wasted data transfer and disk space consumption. However, IFF,\n    the local disk file is a tombstone, current object-server will\n    write the data in the device and cleanup it according to timestamp\n    comparison result in hash_cleanup_list_dir, and then return 201\n    Created. That's wasted and far from the semantics in the normal case.\n    \n    This patch fixes object-server to catch the DiskFileDeleted exception\n    at PUT request, and then, set the timestamp from tombstone as\n    original_timestamp to be able to compare with request timestamp.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Kazuhiro Miyahara <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I078c9cb90707a3c320708e76ea42cbfa73e1ea4b\n    Closes-Bug: #1546865\n\ncommit 878688cae00576ec0bdb0a66eca7ada95e661c0a\nAuthor: B\u00e9la Vancsics <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Dec 7 17:02:40 2015 +0100\n\n    Reduce code duplication\n    \n    Reduced source code by extracting duplicated code\n    (swift/common/direct_client.py)\n    http://openqa.sed.hu/dashboard/index/5?did=1\n    \n    Change-Id: I47fa6ae12c646e8e42fb0a46a017971f05d883fc\n    Closes-Bug: 1536067\n\ncommit c3201f256cf415988a3cb1c42e9c6b7835195fa3\nAuthor: Kazuhiro MIYAHARA <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jan 8 18:03:33 2016 +0900\n\n    Remove execute permissions from doc files and swift.conf-sample\n    \n    Some doc files and swift.conf-sample were added execute permissions in past changes.\n    This patch remove execute permissions from them.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id8844989a8321578e9207566ebd6660f5b9523f0\n\ncommit e46d6b17251ab538595b1deb5581360a286b8fd1\nAuthor: Christian Schwede <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Feb 17 20:47:26 2016 +0100\n\n    Add note on using printable chars for swift_hash_path_suffix/prefix\n    \n    Using unprintable characters for swift_hash_path_prefix/suffix might lead to\n    hard problems when parsing of these values changes, for example due to newer\n    Python versions or changes in the parsers itself.

This patch adds support for an environment\n    variable to change this value to False so that the fast-post\n    mode is tested when running in-process functional tests.\n    \n    The patch also adds a new tox environment func-in-process-fast-post\n    which forces in-process functional testing with\n    object_post_as_copy=False.\n    \n    The motivation for this change, apart from enabling configurable\n    local testing, is to put support in place for an upstream CI job\n    that will actually functionally test the fast-post mode, which is\n    otherwise only covered by unit tests.\n    \n    There are currently two gate jobs that run the functional tests:\n    \n    - gate-swift-dsvm-functional runs the tests *twice* against a\n      devstack swift service, once using tempauth and once using\n      keystoneauth. The devstack swift service uses the default\n      object_post_as_copy=True.\n    \n    - gate-swift-tox-func runs the func tests in in-process mode\n      which also uses tempauth and object_post_as_copy=True. This\n      duplicates one of the config scenarios above.\n    \n    With this change either the gate-swift-tox-func job or a new job\n    could run the functional tests using object_post_as_copy=False.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia37f6df1dc38e44ef7404fbf0a52f6fc22fae0c2\n\ncommit 4ba290bac19b1b6e8f709848fd35cda33b8bd1c4\nAuthor: Qiaowei Ren <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Feb 1 16:44:52 2016 +0800\n\n    Replace exit() by sys.exit()\n    \n    sys.exit() is considered good to use here.\n    \n    Change-Id: I365b0dbb50c8f1953b41665ba49145ac6db1b24f\n\ncommit 9aff76bd18e609eb657db14f2d60e605ee28d472\nAuthor: Qiaowei Ren <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Feb 1 17:15:32 2016 +0800\n\n    fix typo\n    \n    informations -> information\n    \n    Change-Id: I6bcb9bb9fd24b873b49de4a686b223550dd703ac\n\ncommit a8e0dc550bf35010595ce791433cd68c4b8d5287\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Jan 31 06:15:17 2016 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: If1cd20e187720f5ee02c6a1574f612c8a8e26e30\n\ncommit 02c06585e6e0403d1a983fccaba5093e3d3fa7c5\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jan 29 22:46:50 2016 +0100\n\n    Renamed variable for better code readability\n    \n    Change-Id: I22d8db0dd9edc39672fc9997895a24f669975e15\n\ncommit 595ec464e3fdc5a766eee9baa06edd074576c73e\nAuthor: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jan 29 15:28:56 2016 +0000\n\n    Trivial fix for sphinx warnings\n    \n    Including a * in the param name causes a sphinx warning,\n    messes up the html formatting, and strictly the * isn't part of\n    the param name.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6be6a7aa2a371eaae9f8e501435838c1e15f4a1c\n\ncommit cc90834a8ed7bd84440bf132a94978a47ee2f3da\nAuthor: Mingyu Li <li.mingyu@99cloud.net>\nDate:   Fri Jan 29 03:48:47 2016 +0900\n\n    A minor modification of the Deployment Guide\n    \n    In the section of General Service Tuning, there is a sentence\n    \"Our Storage servers all run together on the same servers\".\n    The word \"servers\" is used twice with different meanings, which\n    would be a little confusing.

This could be observed via strace as a\n    socket that had shutdown() called on it, but was never closed. It\n    could also be observed by counting entries in /proc/<pid>/fd, where\n    <pid> is the pid of a proxy server worker process.\n    \n    This is due to a memory leak in SegmentedIterable. A SegmentedIterable\n    has an 'app_iter' attribute, which is a generator. That generator\n    references 'self' (the SegmentedIterable object). This creates a\n    cyclic reference: the generator refers to the SegmentedIterable, and\n    the SegmentedIterable refers to the generator.\n    \n    Python can normally handle cyclic garbage; reference counting won't\n    reclaim it, but the garbage collector will. However, objects with\n    finalizers will stop the garbage collector from collecting them* and\n    the cycle of which they are part.\n    \n    For most objects, \"has finalizer\" is synonymous with \"has a __del__\n    method\". However, a generator has a finalizer once it's started\n    running and before it finishes: basically, while it has stack frames\n    associated with it**.\n    \n    When a client disconnects mid-stream, we get a memory leak. We have\n    our SegmentedIterable object (call it \"si\"), and its associated\n    generator. si.app_iter is the generator, and the generator closes over\n    si, so we have a cycle; and the generator has started but not yet\n    finished, so the generator needs finalization; hence, the garbage\n    collector won't ever clean it up.\n    \n    The socket leak comes in because the generator *also* refers to the\n    request's WSGI environment, which contains wsgi.input, which\n    ultimately refers to a _socket object from the standard\n    library.

The stopping is the important part.\n    \n    Previously, it would quickly find a handoff in each unused region,\n    then spend way too long looking for more unused regions; the same was\n    true for zones, IPs, and so on. Thus, in commit 9cd7c6c, we started\n    counting regions and zones, then stopping when we found them all.\n    \n    This count included all regions and zones in the ring, regardless of\n    whether or not there were actually any parts assigned or not. In rings\n    with an empty region, i.e. a region for which there are only\n    zero-weight devices, get_more_nodes() would be very slow.\n    \n    This commit ignores devices with no assigned partitions when counting\n    regions, zones, and so forth, thus greatly speeding things up.\n    \n    The output of get_more_nodes() is unchanged. This is purely an\n    optimization.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1534303\n    \n    Change-Id: I4a5c57205e87e1205d40fd5d9458d4114e524332\n\ncommit 70047709fc9885df7019f791e17a3240682cc6cb\nAuthor: keliang <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jan 15 00:31:51 2016 +0800\n\n    Drop python 2.6 support\n    \n    Change-Id: Id6329c863dacb189fccfc304453ed7b6f9607c14\n\ncommit a4c2fe95ab2fbe59379a69914ed0fac49c28efbb\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jan 12 21:26:33 2016 +0100\n\n    Allow to change auditor sleep interval in config\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic451c5e0b686509f8982ed1bf65a223a2d77b9a0\n\ncommit edc823e8030640184071fee4920d34f9a1cc6b3e\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Nov 29 18:46:47 2015 +0100\n\n    Show UTC time in swift-recon.\n    \n    It's not consistent now for example local time in replication part and\n    UTC time at begging of line.

The changes are around address handling.\n    Namely, if a server is specified with an address\n    [<address>]:port (port is optional), it is assumed to be an IPv6\n    address [1]. If an IPv6 address is specified without \"[]\", an exception\n    is raised as it is impossible to parse such addresses correctly.\n    \n    For testing, memcache can be configured to listen on the link-local,\n    unique-local, or ::1 (equivalent to 127.0.0.1) addresses. Link-local\n    addresses are assigned by default to each interface and are of the form\n    \"fe80::dead:beef\". These addresses require a scope ID, which would look\n    like \"fe80::dead:beef%eth0\" (replacing eth0 with the correct interface).\n    \n    Unique-local addresses are any addresses in the fc00::/7 subnet. To add\n    a ULA to an interface use the \"ip\" utility. For example:\n    \"ip -6 address add fc01::dead:beef dev eth0\". Lastly, and probably\n    simplest, memcache can be configured to listen on \"::1\".

The store is implemented using a directory\n    structure that resembles that of the containers directory, but has\n    entries only for containers enabled for sync.\n    The store is maintained in two ways:\n    1. Preemptively by the container server when processing\n    PUT/POST/DELETE operations targeted at containers with\n    x-container-sync-key / x-container-sync-to\n    2. In the background using the containers replicator\n    whenever it processes a container set up for sync\n    \n    The change updates [1]\n    [1] http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/overview_container_sync.html\n    \n    Change-Id: I9ae4d4c7ff6336611df4122b7c753cc4fa46c0ff\n    Closes-Bug: #1476623\n\ncommit e75888b281d59df0889f28d0b32241dac3a34aa2\nAuthor: HugoKuo <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jan 6 14:33:23 2016 +0800\n\n    Add more description for write_affinity_node_count parameter in the doc.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iad410a2be4f9a2cd5c53e860b9f91993aa7f2369\n    Closes-Bug: #1531173\n\ncommit 3b1591f235f4b85796917507be5e7fd80365ff9e\nAuthor: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Sep 30 19:08:09 2015 +0200\n\n    swift-init: New option kill-after-timeout\n    \n    This option send SIGKILL to daemon after kill_wait period.\n    When daemon hangs and doesn't respond to SIGTERM/SIGHUP\n    there is no way to stop it using swift-init now.

However, if you're doing something like assembling a\n    video of short clips out of a larger one, then you might not need a\n    full 1 MiB.\n    \n    The reason for the 1 MiB restriction was to protect Swift from\n    resource overconsumption. It takes CPU, RAM, and internal bandwidth to\n    connect to an object server, so it's much cheaper to serve a 10 GiB\n    SLO if it has 10 MiB segments than if it has 10 B segments.\n    \n    Instead of a strict limit, now we apply ratelimiting to small\n    segments. The threshold for \"small\" is configurable and defaults to 1\n    MiB. SLO segments may now be as small as 1 byte.\n    \n    If a client makes SLOs as before, it'll still be able to download the\n    objects as fast as Swift can serve them. However, a SLO with a lot of\n    small ranges or segments will be slowed down to avoid resource\n    overconsumption. This is similar to how DLOs work, except that DLOs\n    ratelimit *every* segment, not just small ones.\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    \n    For operators: if your cluster has enabled ratelimiting for SLO, you\n    will want to set rate_limit_under_size to a large number prior to\n    upgrade. This will preserve your existing behavior of ratelimiting all\n    SLO segments. 5368709123 is a good value, as that's 1 greater than the\n    default max object size. Alternately, hold down the 9 key until you\n    get bored.\n    \n    If your cluster has not enabled ratelimiting for SLO (the default), no\n    action is needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id1ff7742308ed816038a5c44ec548afa26612b95\n",
