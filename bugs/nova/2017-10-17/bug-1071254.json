Since capabilities are sent by periodic_task, it takes some time for the scheduler to get to know the capabilities. If a \"run_instance\" request comes in this duration, the scheduler cannot route the request to suitable nova-compute.",

So it\n    is reasonable to change HostManager to ignore hosts whose capabilities are\n    \"None\" since it becomes a rare case; this will make scheduling more\n    reliable. This will achieved by Another patch.\n    \n    Change-Id: If6582765011fd5e1b794bfdc068e17630ba381cb\n",
