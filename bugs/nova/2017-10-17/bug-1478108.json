Since we can now\n    block immediately on the semaphore, this also implements the behavior we have in\n    build, which spawns a new thread for the process so that we don't starve our\n    RPC workers waiting on the semaphore. In reality, live migrations take a long time,\n    so this was something we should have already had.\n    \n    Further, as soon as we receive the request to do the live migration, we mark the\n    migration object as status='queued' to indicate that it's waiting for its turn\n    on the compute node. Once we're given a slot to run, the normal status='preparing'\n    will be set. This will allow an operator to monitor the status of queued and\n    running migrations.\n    \n    This includes a change to the libvirt driver to avoid spawning another thread\n    for the live migrations process. That makes it synchronous from the perspective\n    of compute manager, and in line with all the other drivers that support the\n    operation. Since compute manager now spawns the thread, libvirt is unaffected\n    and the other drivers avoid potentially starving the RPC worker pool as well.\n    \n    [1] Commit 5a542e770648469b0fbb638f6ba53f95424252ec\n    \n    DocImpact: Adds a new configuration variable to limit parallel live migrations.\n               Zero means \"unlimited\" and nonzero means \"this many in parallel\".\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1478108\n    Change-Id: Ia8a796372746b7fc75485dc2e663f270dbd5893a\n",
