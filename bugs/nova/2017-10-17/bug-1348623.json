Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jul 14 14:25:14 2014 +0100\n\n    compute: Add standard constants for hypervisor virt types\n    \n    Introduce a nova/compute/hvtype.py module to serve a similar\n    role to nova/compute/vm_mode.py, by providing constants for known\n    hypervisor virtualization types. This is primarily used as second\n    component of entries in the 'supported_instances' host state\n    property. It is not to be confused with the hypervisor driver\n    types.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1348623\n    Change-Id: I553697992b010179e2bbf25fb8c0d471a15e4b3e\n",

Where we get hypervisor types from external systems,\n    validate them against the list of acceptable names.\n    \n    The Xen hypervisor is reporting a virt type of 'xapi' for\n    supported instances which is confusing the virtualization\n    type with the hypervisor API access method. It should be\n    reporting 'xen' as the virtualization type.\n    \n    On the other side, the ImagePropertiesFilter will canonicalize\n    the hvtype it fetches from image metadata, so that 'xapi' gets\n    remapped to 'xen' during comparison.\n    \n    Upgrade-impact: the hyervisor type will intentionally no longer\n      distinguish libvirt Xen from XenAPI within a compute cloud.\n      The driver name should be used instead\n    Closes-bug: #1348623\n    Change-Id: I2c740e8eb068a5d93ba5f72292fb30d899931ea5\n",
