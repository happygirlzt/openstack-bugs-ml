The only difference is that this line would also call into whatever rpc_backend is configured and let it register anything it wants to, as well.  Since fake_flags is loaded at this point, it's going to call into nova.rpc.impl_fake, which doesn't register anything....",

If we can standardize having all of the projects use a global config object that lives in openstack.common.cfg then we can get rid of this mess.",
