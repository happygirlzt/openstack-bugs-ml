If you are using the VNC server though, it is *strongly* recommended to *NEVER* add the \"-k\" option, because it will force QEMU to do keymap conversions which are known to be lossy. The result is that users (particularly those with non-US layout keyboards) will be unable to enter certain key combinations.  Leave out \"-k\", and allow VNC clients to pass through raw scan codes directly to the guest without any lossy munging by QEMU.\n\nNB, I am a long term maintainer of the QEMU VNC code & the GTK-VNC client.",

If we allow to pass keymap parameter to boot api [1](specs are up for review), then a user can specify which keymap to be used during booting instance based on the keymap that he/she will configure in the client os (machine from where user will access the vm  using vnc console). This way, I think user should be able to get better results.\n\nPlease let me know what do you think abouut it.\n\nThank you.\n\n[1] : https://review.openstack.org/#/c/448830",
