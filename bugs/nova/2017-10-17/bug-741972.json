            "content": "Good question.  I looked over the spec and couldn't find anything about this topic.\n\nSo I'm proposing we change the default behavior to only return an endpoint header if it actually exists.  Or at the very least, document that you may get a blank one back.  That said, I think not returning the header at all is smarter since I imagine some people will want to run OpenStack for only a subset of services, which could one day mean some people are looking at a lot of blank headers.\n",
