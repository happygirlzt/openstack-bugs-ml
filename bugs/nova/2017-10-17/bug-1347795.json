In the periodic task it is passed through without modification (i.e. the Nova resource tracker stats are not added), in other code paths that update the compute_node it is over-written by the Nova resource tracker stats.\n\nI have run up an ironic environment with a number of nodes without the https://review.openstack.org/#/c/71557/ commit and looked at the database. Some reported the driver stats and some the nova stats, but none reported the union of the two.\n\nSo the revert may fix the CI, but it will not correct the problem.",
