This code was written to be minimally\n    invasive with the intent of back-porting to Kilo.\n    \n    The protection is enabled and disabled with the same\n    'prevent_arp_spoofing' agent config flag added for the OVS agent\n    in I7c079b779245a0af6bc793564fa8a560e4226afe.\n    \n    The protection works by setting up an ebtables chain for each port\n    and jumping all ARP traffic to that chain. The port-specific chains\n    have a default DROP policy and then have allow rules installed that\n    only allow ARP traffic with a source CIDR that matches one of the\n    port's fixed IPs or an allowed address pair.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1274034\n    Change-Id: I0b0e3b1272472385dff060897ecbd25e93fd78e7\n\ncommit 18bc67d56faef30a0f73429a5ee580e052858cb5\nAuthor: armando-migliaccio <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jul 2 12:56:24 2015 -0700\n\n    COMMON_PREFIXES cleanup - patch 5/5\n    \n    Get rid of COMMON_PREFIXES, as now the prefix is a service's declaritive property.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d306131df94188f75e69edb13d262721d10bee5\n    Depends-on: I0450d0b2bf409d470a3a87bfd96518939759a84e\n    Depends-on: Ia34695967cbbec0a1cf0884dad82e096de8539b8\n    Depends-on: Ib9517b772fe426eaf0809c439aa3ba0448c7abaa\n\ncommit f9e9de9f810f2752d295a379459b9a93aa01ee4d\nAuthor: Carl Baldwin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 30 20:22:46 2015 +0000\n\n    Refactor init_l3 to separate router port use case\n    \n    Future work will extend init_l3 with more code specific to router\n    ports.

While testtools\n    may raise a TypeError when trying to query a fixture that failed to\n    setup, this is only ever a cascading failure - it will not cause\n    tests to fail, cause leaks, or cause tests to incorrectly pass. That\n    will be fixed in testtools soon to stop it happening (but as it cannot\n    affect whether a test passes or fails or leaks happen there is no\n    reason to wait for that). Leaks are seen with fixtures 1.3.0 still\n    because eventlet raises a BaseException subclass rather than an\n    Exception subclass, and fixtures 1.3.0 didn't handle that - 1.3.1 does.\n    \n    Secondly, some of the fixtures had race conditions where things were\n    started and then cleanups scheduled. Where possible I've fixed those,\n    but some of them require more significant work to fully address.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3290712f7274970defda19263f4955e3c78e5ed6\n    Depends-On: I8c01506894ec0a92b53bc0e4ad14767f2dd6a6b3\n    Closes-bug: #1453888\n\ncommit 3da491cf5fe629559281507f65f12a0e34eaedf7\nAuthor: Assaf Muller <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 30 13:22:17 2015 -0400\n\n    Disable pylint job\n    \n    Disabling pylint until it gets unbroken.
