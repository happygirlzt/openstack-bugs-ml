    "description": "_live_migration_common_check tries to catch exception.NotFileFound when trying to do rpc.call()s... but something feels wrong here.\n\nI'm refactoring scheduler tests and found this, but I don't know the intended behavior.  The code around mounted_on_same_shared_storage() is confusing and doesn't seem quite right.  I don't see why we raise NotFileFound only to catch it in the caller... instead of just checking the result of the calling function.  Also good to note: If an exception occurs in compute manager's 'create_shared_storage_test_file', the rpc.call to it will not re-raise the original exception.  rpc.common.RemoteError will end up being raised on the calling side.  I could see 'create_shared_storage_test_file' failing with OSError if the dir doesn't exist, etc...\n\nI'm noting this bug ID in the code w/ my refactor for someone else to take a look at.",
