    "description": "When boot VM with '--num-instances',  the param \"request_spec['instance_properties']\" that schedule_run_instance gets will be only the first instance's properties of request_spec.get('instance_uuids'), thus like request_spec['instance_properties']['instance_uuid'] , request_spec['instance_properties']['hostname'] and so on are all just the properties of the first VM.\n\nFurthermore, if one of the VMs booting with '--num-instances' reschedules,  request_spec['instance_properties'] is still for the first VM. Thus, using the data from request_spec['instance_properties'] is mistake, like instance_uuid = instance_properties.get('uuid') in filter_scheduler.py:def _populate_retry().",
