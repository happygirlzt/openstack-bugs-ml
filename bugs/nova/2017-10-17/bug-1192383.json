Then there is no need for clients to store tokens in python keyring etc.,\nBut its the question of optimzation - if nova is making several calls to neutron client why it should need new token for every single operation in the same sequence?\nI feel it should be optimized in nova at least in a given context whether client caches the token or keystone re-uses the token and remove the additional cpu cycles.\n\nOleg, That does not help if neutron client is initialized several times.. isnt it?",
