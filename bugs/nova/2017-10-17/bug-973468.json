The compilation of this library generates the \"guestmount\" command line necessary for LXC.\n\nAfter trying LXC, I switched back to KVM but after that, Nova was unable to activate instances which stay at the \"building\" state and there is no error reported in the nova-compute log file.\n\nAfter removing the \"guestmount\" command line, Nova is OK.",
