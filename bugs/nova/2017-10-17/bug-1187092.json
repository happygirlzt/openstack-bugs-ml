    "description": "Suppose I have 3 networks: a_network, g_network and z_network. When booting a new instance, through Horizon, I assign the networks are such: nic1=g_network, nic2=a_network and nic3=z_network. After the instance has been booted, I login and verify that all of the nics are assigned accordingly.\n\nNow I reboot the instance from Horizon. After the instance reboots I login and notice that nic1 is on the a_network, nic2 is on z_network and nic3 is on the g_network.\n\nI would have suspected that after rebooting the instance its nic to network mapping would have remained the same.\n\nEnvironment:\n  * Nova version: Grizzly\n  * Quantum for networking",
