The function get_host_ip_addr\n    is used by the resource_tracker and if it is not implemented all resize\n    operations fail.\n    \n    Also put back the check for missing host, user, password config options\n    in the driver constructor.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1356449\n    \n    Change-Id: I4ba6a0f9c3b9c2ce0e1750f8414625235d01d422\n",
