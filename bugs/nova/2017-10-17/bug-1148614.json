Build an instance\n2. Attach a cinder-volume (using lvm+iscsi driver)\n3. Sever the iscsi connection: killall -s9 tgtd on the cinder volume server\n4. Reboot instance\n5. Verify that instance goes to halted and can't be started\n\nProposed solution:\n\nThe proposed solution as a few different steps:\n\n1. Detect that reboot failed due to bad-volumes being attached\n2.

Raise an exception to notify the compute-manager layer that a driver operation had the *side-effect* of detaching a set of 'bad' volumes so that any compute level cleanups (destroy BDM, Cinder volume detach) can be made\n\nNote:\n\nThe current method of detecting which volume is 'bad' indirectly makes use of a 120 sec timeout within the XenServer code. An upstream patch from Citrix to so that we can 'fail-fast' here would speed up error recover dramatically.\n\nFor example, on a given network, we might want to say that a connection hung for more than 10 secs is in accessible rather than having to wait a full two minutes.",
