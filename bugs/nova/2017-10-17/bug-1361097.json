We don't pop\n    the exception message anymore in _log_compute_error so that the\n    final \"max attempts\" error message has an opportunity to dump it\n    as well.\n    \n    This defect caused the exception text (from the compute process) to\n    ALWAYS be None, thus making it difficult to triage compute errors.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5c7cac1d79dc583cca523270bb0a96d3353ca1f6\n    Closes-Bug: #1361097\n",
