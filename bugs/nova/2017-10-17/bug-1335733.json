So we need to fix this from both Nova and Neutron client side.",

So if a user with admin role want to create an instance\n    for another tenant, and using a a security group which name is\n    duplicated in Neutron. Then the boot will fail.\n    \n    This patch is the fix on neutron client part. It will enhance the\n    method find_resourceid_by_name_or_id to support project id as a\n    parameter so as to get the correct security group id when passing\n    a security gruop name.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibd1829bd0f22f56c4fa210c67d10e1db5556c033\n    Closes-Bug: 1335733\n",
