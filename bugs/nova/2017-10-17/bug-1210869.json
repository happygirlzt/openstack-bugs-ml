DOS protection should be done at a\ndifferent layer. Instead this module should be used to protect against\nunintentional user actions. With that in mind the limits set here should be\nhigh enough as to not rate-limit any intentional actions.\n\nSo personally I think we should not issue a security advisory as this one should not be deployed to guard against potential denial of service attacks... but this may be worth an OSSN to promote this warning more widely.",
