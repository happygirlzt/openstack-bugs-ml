    "description": "The glance plugin for xenapi will retry contacting a glance host a configurable number of times before giving up. Unfortunately, while multiple glance hosts can be configured in nova, it will pick one for each call to the glance plugin. If the picked host is not functioning correctly, it will never try another host that might be up.\n\nIt should send a list of hosts to the plugin and let the retry logic in the plugin try multiple hosts instead of one.",

            "content": "I think such a logic should be in the compute manager so that every driver can benefit from it (e.g. the manager tries a HEAD request or something like that). This would leave the driver unaware of the fact that multiple glance apis are available. Once the manager has determined that there is a valid glance api to get images from/push snapshots to, it will then pass that api reference to the driver. The driver code hence remains fairly unchanged.\n\n",

            "content": "That would require a fairly significant restructuring of the code since the compute manager is pretty ignorant about image services or how the drivers actually work. Implementing retries at the manager level would be pretty awkward right now.\n\nI'm testing a change which moves the retry logic from the glance plugin to the xenapi driver. This will allow it to cycle through glance hosts to find one that is actually working.\n\nI'm not against a more significant restructuring, but as an intermediate step I think the patch I'll propose later today will be a good minimal step.",
