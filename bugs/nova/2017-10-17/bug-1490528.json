Boot VM 'test1' from Ubuntu image\n4. Install stress tool on the VM: 'sudo apt-get install stress'\n5. Add 'stress' tool in autorun: 'sudo echo \"stress --cpu 10 &\" > /etc/rc.local'\n6. Reboot VM 'test1'\n7. Make a snapshot of 'test1' VM\n8. Mark this snapshot as 'public' in Glance\n9. Create 10 VMs with this image (snapshot) from admin user.

Boot 10 VMs with public image 'TestImage'\n\nExpected Result:\nVMs will start as quickly as for the admin tenant.\n\nObserved Result:\nVMs hang in \"Downloading Image\" operation, it takes more than 20 minutes to run VM from the snapshot in other tenants (but in the same time it takes a few seconds to run VMs from the same image from tenant where we have created the image).\n\nLooks like Nova tries to copy this image for each new tenant, and it doesn't looks correct.",

Once you have spawned an instance from this particular image on this compute, for all subsequent VMs nova-compute will *not* download the image from Glance again, but will use the cached one instead (technically, nova-compute uses it as a backing file for QCOW2 images and copies a RAW image locally).",
