    "description": "When using a weak storage backend and initiating the creation of a lot of new instances using volumes as backend (directly created from an image) I got a lot of InvalidBDM: Block Device Mapping is Invalid. After I had a look on the method _await_block_device_map_created (in nova/manager/ComputeManager) the solution was pretty easy: increasing the max_tries and/or wait_between parameters solved the issue. The storage backend could simply not provide this mass of volumes in a very short time (100 seconds on my testing system).",
