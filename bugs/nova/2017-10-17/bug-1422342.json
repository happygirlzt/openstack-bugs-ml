For XenAPI this param is properly passed to underlying\nVMOps class in nova/virt/xenapi/vmops.py which implements the reboot() for Xen. \nSo you can have, either proper SOFT or HARD reboot and this looks fine for me.\n\nWhile in the nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py, if reboot_type=='SOFT' fails nova unconditionally \ndoes the hard reboot what can be sometimes unexpected but at the end of the day we\nwant to reboot the VM.",
