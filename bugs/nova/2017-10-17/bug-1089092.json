    "description": "When an instance is created, network_info is allocated prior to spawning, and starts showing in the os-api's server dict as 'addresses'. Any failure in virt to spawn the instance will cause the network to be deallocated, and the instance rescheduled on another host, which will re-allocate the network, potentially getting a new ip address. Which would then be shown in api calls. We should allow the operator to hide the network_info until such a time the spawn is successful.",
