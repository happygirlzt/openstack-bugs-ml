So let's enable that as well. In the worst case scenario\n    mentioned in the bug, it was set to 'False' and since the check for\n    force_config_drive took any string as true, we were enabling the flag\n    to true. With the change in this review, we force a conversion of the\n    string to true. Additional check for the flag to be set as 'always' is\n    treated as true as well. The test case checks for all the variations\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1319180\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifa6348fa7dfd9de063eb13d30e3ddf94fa530b57\n",
