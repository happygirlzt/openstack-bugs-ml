    "description": "The trigger_members_refresh method in compute.api.py specifies a group id in the call to refresh_security_group_members. This is just the last group id seen and ignores the fact that a refresh may impact members of multiple groups.\n\nPossible fallout from this is covered by the fact that the do_refresh_security_group_rules method in virt.firewall.py takes a specific group id but doesn't target just members of that group for refresh, rather it refreshes the rules for all instances on the host. This can lead to a lot of time wasted in needless refreshes of security group rules.\n\nI would propose changing the logic of trigger_members_refresh so that instead of specifying a group to refresh it sends  a specific refresh request per instance impacted, then alter the logic in do_refresh_security_group_rules to refresh a single instance resulting in refresh of only those rules that need it and removing the possibility of refreshing an instance multiple times if it is a member of more than one affected group.",

This\n    is just the last group id seen and ignores the fact that a\n    refresh may impact members of multiple groups.\n    \n    This is masked by the fact that on the host the group id is\n    ignored and all instances have their security rules refreshed\n    regardless of if they are part of the changed group or not.\n    \n    This change modifies the logic surrounding refreshes so we send\n    a refresh request for each instance which is affected by a\n    security group change, this ensures we aren't spending time\n    refreshing unaffected instances and also removes the possibility\n    of refreshing an instance multiple times if it is a member of\n    more than one group.\n    \n    Also changed to be instance-centric is the refresh carried out\n    when a rule is added/removed to a security group.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iec98e9aed818fdc4ecc88c8dcdd4ee5fa9386e00\n",
