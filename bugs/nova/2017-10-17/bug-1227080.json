But\n    deleted_at is always set when the entry is deleted in the DB,\n    whereas terminated_at can be left unset in some error cases.\n    \n    Rather than present terminated_at as the deleted_at value in\n    the message we include both and let the recipient decide which\n    they want to use.\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1227080\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic67f66b6c64be1a8f43f4fdd5b1fac25f1414247\n",
