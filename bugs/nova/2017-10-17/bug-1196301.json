That\n    almost makes bug 1196301 go away, but will require instance\n    actions work as well.\n    \n    This also adds a new cells method for passing the object to reboot in\n    the child cell.\n    \n    Related to blueprint compute-api-objects\n    \n    Change-Id: I7845daa266687b5dc24fc2b1a98f2e5a2841e4bf\n",
