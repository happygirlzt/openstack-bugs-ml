Unfortunately in multi_host an\n    associate or disassociate call can be forwarded from one host to\n    another. Currently the override happens on the caller side instead of\n    the callee side. This fixes the issue by moving the override.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1096987\n    \n    Change-Id: I37fbbf9e0ee0ffbe8c8754649301371b98da9f4f\n",
