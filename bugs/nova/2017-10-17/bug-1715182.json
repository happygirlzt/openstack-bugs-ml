The pre_live_migration on the destination host fails. The\n       _do_live_migration method calls _rollback_live_migration\n       explicitly to cleanup the dest host.\n    \n    2. The live migration in the virt driver fails, and the virt driver\n       calls back to _rollback_live_migration in the ComputeManager.\n    \n    Either way, the instance is not on the destination host, so just like\n    how we remove volume connections and unplug vifs from the destination\n    host, we need to also remove allocations for the destination node in\n    Placement.\n    \n    This change adds a test to show that we are not currently cleaning up\n    allocations on the destination node when we rollback from a live\n    migration failure.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icbd5d7ff41aa04f8f7934fdce9668762691a4a69\n    Related-Bug: #1715182\n",
