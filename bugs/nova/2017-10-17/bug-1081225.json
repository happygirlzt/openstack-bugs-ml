Currently when this happens the resize up codepath is used and the instance memory is sized down, but the disk space is not.  So a user could boot up an instance with the largest disk available then resize down to a smaller instance and still have the large disk on their instance.  But resizing the disk down would be dangerous if the filesystem on the instance hasn't been resized first.",

And not resizing down the disk space with the\n    instance allows for users to have more space on their instance than the\n    type should allow.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1081225\n    \n    Change-Id: I980c0699dfc272155e274a96d6e08e131c1372d9\n",
