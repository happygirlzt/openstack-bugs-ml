This may confuse the\n    user or make him/her think the tracking is innaccurate.\n    \n    This patch seeks to remove any confusion. It is in the\n    same vein as https://review.openstack.org/#/c/93261/\n    which addresses the same issue in regards to cpu and\n    memory audit logs.\n    \n    Change-Id: I184985573b20144717ac40f1f3c26709030d5a03\n    Closes-bug: #1350542\n",
