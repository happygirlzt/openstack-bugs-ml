I later found out the machine my instance was on had somes issues and was subsequently  rebooted.

How do I fix my server without requiring customer service to do it for me?\n\nI think a hard reboot should always be allowed no matter what, so I have a way of resetting my server if it gets in any sort of bad state.",
