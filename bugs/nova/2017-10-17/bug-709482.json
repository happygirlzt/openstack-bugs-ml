Now it throws a generic EC2 exception because the backend was changed at some point to raise NotFound instead of returning an empty user object.\n\nThe change is good but the admin client hasn't been updated to reflect this behavior.  This completely breaks trying to do any kind of automated deployments for dashboard.",
