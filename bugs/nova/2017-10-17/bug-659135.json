    "description": "Security Group ingress filtering doesn't for routed traffic. I.e. if the VM's are connected to a bridge, traffic coming into the host on an interface that isn't on the same bridge, the incoming traffic escapes filtering. This is due to a shortcoming in libvirt's nwfilter code which didn't get updated in response to a change in the linux kernel that removed support for --physdev-out filtering for non-bridged traffic.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=642171",
