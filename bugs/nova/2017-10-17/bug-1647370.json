However, the\n    resource usage would get recalculated correctly by the next periodic\n    resource audit.\n    \n    If the audit got executed, it corresponds to the old flavor, and resources\n    get dropped properly.\n    \n    This patch removes part of the condition in drop_move_claim() which was\n    trying to validate that the instance type (itype) stored in the\n    tracked_migration was corresponding instance type being passed in the\n    method.  Looking at the code where drop_move_claim() is being called shows\n    that we can safely remove this check since it is known (based on the prefix)\n    which resources needs to be dropped.\n    \n    Also, unit test changes from b816e3 were moved to a separate test.  It\n    introduced a hacky way to force the migration dest_compute and makes it hard\n    to keep _test_finish_revert_resize() generic and have the resources correctly\n    tracked.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1647370\n    Change-Id: Ic02b56be5684d9206ece4c20f5194802dfe12e25\n",
