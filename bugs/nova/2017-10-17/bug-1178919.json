This fixes bug 1178919, in which a node that had previously\n    gotten stuck in a power-on state (eg, in the BIOS screen) would fail to\n    spawn() because the baremetal driver would send a power-on request, the\n    BMC would ignore it, and then baremetal driver would wait indefinitely\n    for a DHCP request.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie73e6ab488abe99c70ad3d149d702577941056d1\n",
