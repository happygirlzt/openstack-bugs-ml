Without this minor addition to the vmwareapi virt layer, vsphere will be unable to leverages these advanced extensions correctly. ",

Comments below:\n\n\n- As per bug report title, \"fail to work properly with the base Neutron plugin\" means \"no VM connectivity\"\n- What is the failure? Compute fails to find the right network\n- Why? With the embedded ovs plugin, vsphere expects opaque networks to exists and be configured on the hypervisor; these are not created by the base Neutron plugin.\n- How does it occur? As I mentioned above, this occurs with vsphere 5.5 and Neutron NVP plugin.\n\nI can dive into the technical details a lot more if you are really interested (as it seems you are), but I hope this suffices.",
