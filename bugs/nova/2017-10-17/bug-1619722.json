Thus, when updating\n    inventory we no longer check the new capacity against existing\n    allocations, we just let it happen (but log a warning).\n    \n    This is safe because allocations in excess of capacity will still\n    prevent resources from being used.\n    \n    Change-Id: I48ae1d7cd6bc309243493ddac99ce990c0146534\n    Closes-Bug: #1619722\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n",
