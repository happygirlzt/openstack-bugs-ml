To make this filtering logic usable for filtering\n    metadata of other resources, it is being moved to utils.py file. The\n    filtering metadata logic is going to be used for filtering volume and\n    volume snapshot metadata in the EC2 API, at the very least.\n    \n    There were no unit tests present at all to test the filtering logic.\n    Those have been added too, and in the process of writing unit tests,\n    a bug was found: a single character value of a resource metadata\n    (e.g. 'c') matches when a filter is specified which contains\n    that character as a part of input matching string (e.g.\n    all resources which has a metadata value = 'taco')\n    \n    The bug has also been fixed, and accompanying testcase added\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1364758\n    Closes-Bug: 1365887\n    Change-Id: Ie9dbb50b79c042e49ef7eaba831280e175cc1e7f\n",
