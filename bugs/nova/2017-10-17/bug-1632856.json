However, this will\n    not work in Python 3, as the base64.b64encode() method requires bytes,\n    not a string. As a result, importing the test class fails and no tests\n    get run.\n    \n    Note that this change doesn't fix all tests to work under Python 3; it\n    simply fixes the bug that prevents the tests from running at all under\n    Python 3.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1632856\n    \n    Change-Id: I35a7b02132bed0387a173b339f6204bf0e3269de\n",
