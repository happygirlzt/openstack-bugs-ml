    "description": "Nova does not clean up the allocation of an evacuated instance from the recovered source compute host if the instance is not any more defined on the hypervisor. \n\nTo reproduce:\n* Boot an instance\n* Kill the compute host the instance is booted on\n* Evacuate the instance\n* Recover the original compute host in a way that clears the instance definition from the hypervisor (e.g. redeploy the compute host).\n* Check the allocations of the instance in placement API. The allocation against the source compute host is not cleaned up.\n\nThe compute manager is supposed to clean up evacuated instances during the compute manager init_host method by calling _destroy_evacuated_instances. However that function only iterates on instances known by the hypervisor [1].\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/5e4c98a58f1afeaa903829f5e3f28cd6dc30bf4b/nova/compute/manager.py#L654",
