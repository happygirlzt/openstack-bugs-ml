    "description": "In https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-count-resources-to-check-quota-in-api\nwe introduced a new workflow of Quota checks. It is possible that concurrent requests can\npass API layer checks, but blocked by conductor layer checks.\n\nThis can actually trigger user-noticeable API behavior changes:\nAs an user, previously, If my request is blocked by quota checks, I will get HTTP 403 response, and no instance records will be left.\n\nAfter the above mentioned change, it is possible that when my requests failed at conductor layer Quota check and I got an instance in ERROR state. And in an busy cloud, users may\ngot a lot of ERROR instances according to this and the instance number may beyond the limit.\n\nWe should at least mention this behavior change in the release note.",
