This all went well except that the name of the unique constraints still reflects the old column name.\n\nFor MySQL:\n\ninstance_id should be named instance_uuid\n\nFor PostgreSQL:\n\ninstance_info_caches_instance_id_key should be named instance_info_caches_instance_uuid_key\n\nRenaming this unique constraint will allow us to more closely match the automatic naming scheme used by python-migrate and should make naming a bit more consistent.",
