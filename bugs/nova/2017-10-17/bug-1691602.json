This can be costly and redundant\n    when performing something like a live migration with multiple\n    ports attached to the same instance.\n    \n    This change simply adds the port ID to the network-changed event\n    since we have it in scope. Nova can use it or not, but at least\n    the information is provided for context.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifdaef05208d09ddd9587fed6214cf388e5265ba4\n    Closes-Bug: #1691602\n",
