The logs provided show that 'qemu-system-x86_64' corresponds to the TCG based QEMU, while  'qemu-spice' is the KVM based QEMU. \n\nEither way, AFAICT, there is nothing notable changed between Havana and Icehouse that would affect the way KVM guests are launched by Nova, but not affect TCG guests.\n\nPossibly there is some non-determinstic bug in QEMU and/or guest kernel that is hitting you here.\n\nI dont think there's enough evidence of a problem in Nova to justify keeping this open.\n\nIf you see problems with current Juno based OpenStack & up2date Ubuntu KVM packages please do feel free to file a new bug.",
