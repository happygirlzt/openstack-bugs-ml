            "content": "Hi Chuck,\n\nI don't have a traceback. But here is my analysis. \nnova.compute.manager.ComputeManager's check_can_live_migrate_destination method will first call nova.virt.driver.check_can_live_migrate_destination method, and store the returned data in  dest_check_data.  For xenapi, if the block_migrate is set to be false, this method call will return None to dest_check_data. Then, it will call nova.compute.rpcapi.check_can_live_migrate_source method. If this method call invokes nova.compute.manager.ComputeManager's check_can_live_migrate_source, it will pase None as the dest_check_data to check_can_live_migrate_source. On line 3023 of nova/compute/manager.py, this check_can_live_migrate_source will try the following: \n        dest_check_data['is_volume_backed'] = is_volume_backed\nIf my understanding of the API call flow is correct, this will raise a NoneType exception if dest_check_data is None. But I could be totally wrong.. Please let me know. Thanks!\n\n\n",
