    "description": "During an unshelve from an offloaded instance, conductor will call the scheduler to pick a host. The scheduler will make allocations against the chosen node as part of that select_destinations() call. Then conductor casts to that compute host to unshelve the instance.\n\nIf the spawn on the hypervisor fails while we've made the instance claim:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc2/nova/compute/manager.py#L4485\n\nOr even if the claim test fails, the allocations on the destination node aren't removed in Placement.\n\nThe RT aborts the claim here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc2/nova/compute/resource_tracker.py#L414\n\nThat calls _update_usage_from_instance but doesn't change the has_ocata_computes kwarg so we get here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc2/nova/compute/resource_tracker.py#L1041\n\nAnd we don't cleanup the allocations for the instance.\n\nThe other case is if the claim fails, the instance_claim method will raise ComputeResourcesUnavailable which would be handled here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc2/nova/compute/claims.py#L161\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc2/nova/compute/manager.py#L4491\n\nBut we don't remove allocations or do any other cleanup there.",
