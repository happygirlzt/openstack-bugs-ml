    "description": "When the nova compute service is starting, it will do a host_init, and this will result in initing instance one by one, by fetching VMs info one by one from vCenter. If there are thousands of VMs on OpenStack, there will be thousands of requests to vCenter, which is a big network burden.\n\nThis circumstance also happens when compute manager doing periodical power state syncing. If the power state syncing takes too long time, and too network bandwidth, it will block the ongoing normal VM deployment.",
