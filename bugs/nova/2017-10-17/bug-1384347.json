Now i've not reproduced it in my local devstack (between juno-3 and juno-rc1).\n\nThough some features in source code still lead to the error (_create_instance in compute/api.py still adds 'default' group if no group s passed, and allocate_for_instance in network/newtronv2/api.py still raise the exception if any of passed groups doesn't exist), the steps mentioned above don't lead to the error. An instance is launched successfully.\n\nThe reason is that a new default group is created at once when existed one is deleted.\nTry to list security groups after deleting default group. You'll find a new one.\n\nThus this bug isn't actual for modern OS versions.",
