Now the points of extension are\n    handled via the --default_host_filters and --least_cost_functions only.\n    \n    Also, greatly simplified the zone handling logic in DistibutedScheduler, mostly\n    by removing the cryptic dicts with helper classes.\n    \n    Fixed up the Least Cost functions to better deal with multiple functions.\n    (In a followup patch I will removed the normalization that occurs as this will\n    be a problem).\n    \n    Tests were mostly rewritten to support this new world order.\n    \n    Debated removing JSONFilter since it's not accessible from the outside world,\n    but decided to keep it as there are discussions afoot on making scheduler\n    changes without having to redeploy code or restart services.\n    \n    HostFilters once again get the all the host service capabilities, but now\n    via a HostInfo class that mostly contains read-only dicts of capabilities.\n    \n    Virtual resource consumption is done in the DistributedScheduler class now.\n    The filters/weighing functions don't need to worry about this. Also, weighing\n    functions only have to return a single host and not worry about the number of\n    instances requested.\n    \n    Change-Id: I92600a4a9c58b1add775c328a18d8f48c305861e\n",
