    "description": "Hi, every one. My OpenStack runs with nova-network, and set FlatDHCP and multi-host supported. However, the br100 of all compute nodes have same IP address (e.g. all are 172.16.0.1). So, the VMs on the different compute nodes cann't communicate. I ask how to configure OpenStack that the br100s have different gateway IP address ? Thank you very much.",
