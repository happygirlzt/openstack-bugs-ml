Attach the above Cinder volume to the above active (running) VM.\n3. Try to migrate this ATTACHED volume between different storages of the same type (cinder retype with --migration-policy on-demand )\n4. The retyped volume gets stuck at \"Retyping\" state forever.\n\nExpected result:\nThe attached volume should be retyped to another storage.\n\nNotes: no specific errors observed from the cinder-volumes.log or cinder-api.log.\nThe attached volume is simply stuck at \"Retyping\" state. A new (temporary) volume was created but stuck at \"Migrating\" state forever as well.\n\nThis issue was observed on the latest Liberty branch. But I believe the same issue might happen with Ocata as well.",
