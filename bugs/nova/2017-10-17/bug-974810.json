            "content": "Now we have done some development and test to fix this bug. The basic approach is making least changes on current globalization framework to accommodate mutiple gettext domains (.po) for multiple languages. There might be only one domain for all languges and components in the future. But it is not true for now. So this appoach might be acceptable for community without changing too much code. Welcome any input on this proposed fix.\n\nSteps:\n1. Add new i18n context modules to redefine the default i18n function _(message) with correct boundled text domain for each component(nova, glance etc). This appoach will avoid overriding the old domain when installing new domain by calling gettext.install(). \n\nnova/nova/i18ncontext.py\n\nimport os\nimport gettext\n\nTEXTDOMAIN = 'nova'\nlocaledir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'locale')\ngettext.bindtextdomain(TEXTDOMAIN, localedir)\n\ndef _(message):\n    return gettext.dgettext(TEXTDOMAIN, message).decode('utf-8')\n\nglance/glance/i18ncontext.py\n\nimport os\nimport gettext\n\nTEXTDOMAIN = 'glance'\nlocaledir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__),'locale')\ngettext.bindtextdomain(TEXTDOMAIN, localedir)\n\ndef _(message):\n    return gettext.dgettext(TEXTDOMAIN, message).decode('utf-8')\n\n2. Add a line of import statement in the module that has reference to function _() for each corresponding component. The trick is using search by _('*') or _(\u201c*\u201d) to find all the modules that need to be changed. \n\n#If the module is using nova messages, add the following line of code:\nfrom nova.i18ncontext import _\n#If the module is using glace message, add this:\nfrom glance.i18ncontext import _",
