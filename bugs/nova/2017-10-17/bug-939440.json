I had successfully restarted all the nova and quantum services without any error (restarting the processes from  their corresponding screen session). Now, on creating a vm, the vm still gets an ip from the old fixed-range network. \na. The fixed-ips table in mysql db still has all the old values ie. 10.0.0.*\nb. The iptable rules are created are successfully applied with the new values of fixed-range i.e. 192.168.10.*\n\nUnderstanding that changing the fixed-range is not a good idea and probably should not be allowed but in any case,\nI think these two (a and b) should be in sync. If db entries are not made w.r.t the new fixed-range, then the iptables rules shouldn't be changed too.\n\nLet me know if anyone needs more details about the setup.",
