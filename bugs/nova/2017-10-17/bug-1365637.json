Cook <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Sep 4 13:17:37 2014 -0500\n\n    xenapi: send chunk terminator on subprocess exc\n    \n    During chunk upload if a subprocess exception is thrown, a malformed\n    chunk upload occurs.\n    \n    This patch adds logging for subprocess exceptions and sends the\n    terminator even in the event of a subprocess exception. The incomplete\n    file upload will then be cleaned up by the client.\n    \n    Change-Id: I559f201430bcd4c36d669c7772a10bfe3cd54d41\n    Closes-Bug: 1365637\n",
