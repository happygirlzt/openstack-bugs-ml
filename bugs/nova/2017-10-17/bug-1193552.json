We\n    need to pop this from dict before creating a instance entry in child cell.\n    \n    The system metadata also need to be recreated in child cell because instance\n    properties dict is converted to primitive which makes instance['system_metadata']\n    a list of dicts.\n    \n    Fix bug #1193552\n    \n    Change-Id: I43a8b4c1673a831b0c87881004eb0a7e5b149d9e\n",
