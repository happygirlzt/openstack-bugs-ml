It's only used in Unit-Test.\nIn fact, if this function is really used in reality, then it will be impossible to attach a volume to a VM instance in the case that the volume is created in a different availability_zone than the VM instance.\n\nHowever,  in reality, for single-node deployment, if a new availability_zone is created in Nova and thus the default availability_zone of Nova is replaced, then Nova compute service will be running in this newly-created availability_zone while Cinder services are still running in the default availability_zone. It is quite possible to attach a volume (created in the default availability_zone) to a VM instance (created in the new availability_zone)",
