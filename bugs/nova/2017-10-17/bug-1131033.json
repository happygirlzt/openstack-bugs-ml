    "description": "The nova.virt.powervm.blockdev module makes a call to fetch_to_raw which requires qemu-img on the system running compute node. Since powervm only supports raw files there is no need to make image conversion and therefore depend on qemu-img. Linux on Power RHEL distro does not include quemu-img by default so this could be an issue that could come up on client shops. To avoid this we can just make a call to images.fetch instead of images.fetch_to_raw. I can provide this fix if assigned to me.",

Even if we figure out how to get a qcow2 from a power raw, linux on power RHEL for example does not include qemu-img by default so clients and contributors will most likely hit this issue.",
