Yes it can be a bit painful but like Vish pointed out above there are a couple different ways to go about it.\n\nVish: ++ on improving the error message of the exception.",

With things like XCP support in Ubuntu coming closer to seeing the light of day, this kinda stuff makes it really difficult to have a nova-common package that can work out of the box with any corresponding compute setup/package.  Granted, currently only libvirt is really supported and we already make assumptions about this in the common nova.conf.  Working around this by adding '--connection_type=' to nova.conf in nova-common is doable in the short term, but if we want packaging to support a variety of configurations (I do), we might (packagers) need to rethink some things (perhaps nova-common-{libvirt, xcp, etc})\n\nDo I understand the proposed solution? \n\n- New users with empty databases and no connection_type get the xen version by default.\n- Exsitng users with  data in the database will need to specify connection_type explicitly during migration\n- From Ubuntu POV, we can continue to be opinionated about what users are deploying, and set connection_type explicitly=libvirt in packaging\n",

I just wish we hadn't let libvirt and xenapi diverge in interpretation originally and then let it stay that way for so long.\n\nIf the definition of \"empty database\" is no instances, I'm fine with defaulting to connection_type == 'xenapi' for the migration. It's certainly more user friendly behavior for new users.\n\nSounds like packagers have it easy, they generally only support libvirt or xenapi and not both.",
