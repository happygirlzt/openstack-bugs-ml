Any\n    datastore which is part of a cluster can be put in maintenance\n    mode. Instances cannot reside on a datastore if it is in\n    maintenance mode.\n    This fix ignores a datastore in the following scenarios\n    1. Stats update - Ignore a datastore during stats update.\n    2. Ignore a datastore during instance spawn.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id0cb3f5fdb4d0bc4884cf5405fadc433d4a2b6ba\n    Closes-Bug: #1330065\n",
