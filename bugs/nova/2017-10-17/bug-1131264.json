This is not necessarily the case,\n    and results in adding None to the list of network ids, which later\n    causes a check to see if the network id list is empty to fail.\n    \n    This only adds the network id to the list if it was specified, and\n    adds a more explicit check to the region that previously fell through\n    without finding a matching network so that a similar case would be\n    easier to debug in the future.\n    \n    Addresses bug #1131264\n    \n    Change-Id: I7a8aaea5772707b8bd6313249e74b1302eedefe8\n",

However, if they do not pass one (which\n    is valid) then we can not do the filter and we fail. This makes the\n    allocation function do the filtering, which should not affect the normal\n    use case where it is only called once, since all the ports returned were\n    allocated at that time.\n    \n    The manager filter behavior is thus removed and a test is added to\n    verify that the allocate method does the right thing the second time\n    around.\n    \n    This fixes the fallout found after fixing the actual cause of bug 1131264\n    \n    Change-Id: I8f3af96051268503596007491af365e8ce28f5b3\n",
