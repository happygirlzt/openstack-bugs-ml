And more worse is that\nhost resource tracker only update compute node into DB when the host resource have changed,so ComputeNode's update time in DB will be less than the update time in scheduler cache,the scheduler cache can't be updated. In this case, the host will not be selected forever.\nWe need to release the host resource when multiple creating instance is failed.",
