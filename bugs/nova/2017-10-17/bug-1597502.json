The problem exhibits itself when the VM is running, so I assumed that it would be a nova issue.\n\nIf you boot a Windows ISO image with nova, (I assume nova) won't utilize the correct drivers to connect to the ephemeral/block storage drive with a Windows ISO. I'm not sure what other product this would be in, if you can tell me I would gladly file a report there.\n\nIn other words, I shouldn't have to perform these instructions to get a Windows image to work. I should be able to boot the ISO, install the drivers within the OS and then continue on with the OS installation. http://docs.openstack.org/image-guide/windows-image.html. My OS install is using KVM, what makes those instructions different than booting the ISO image in OS and installing the drivers?",
