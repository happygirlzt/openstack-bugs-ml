Can we get agreement on whether filters should be case sensitive or not?\n\nI've seen particular situation where different users are responsible for creating flavors and extra_specs on a host aggregate.  In that situation case sensitivity can be more of a pain.\n\ni.e. \nUser one creates flavors to support CPU pinning\n\nnova flavor-key compute-optimized.small set aggregate_instance_extra_specs:pinned\"=\"false\"; \n\nUser two who racks the hardware and configures it in Openstack, specifies which machines can be used for dedicated CPU pinning\n\nnova aggregate-set-metadata 2 pinned=False\n\nIn this scenario the operators would want false == False.\n\n\nAre there any scenarios where case insensitivity would be undesirable?\n\n",
