    "description": "By default, if you are an admin user and you perform a GET on /servers it will return a list of servers for all tenants (projects) in the system regardless of the tenant_id used in the URL.\n\nThis is problematic and can lead to confusion if a tenant alternate tenant ID is specified in the URL. This could be easily accomplished with bindings, novaclient, etc.\n\nTo reproduce do something like this...\n\n1) Setup an installation with multiple users. One should be an adminstrator. The other can be a regular user.\n\n2) Create servers in both accounts.\n\n3) Configure novarc so that it uses the admin credentials /w the tenant ID of the normal user.\n\n4) Do another 'nova list' and notice that servers for all tenants are still returned.\n\n---\n\nI'd like to see us add an 'all_tenants' filter option to the API so that we can maintain the existing behavior for OPS team members. This provides them the ability to search and query servers from multiple tenants from a single account.\n\nHowever if the 'all_tenants' option isn't used we should restrain the API to the tenant_id that was specified in the URL.",
