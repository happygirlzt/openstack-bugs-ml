If the request for detachment does not return any value for more than a minute the proxy will time out the connection.\nWhat I am missing is the difference between a dead process and a process which is working, especially if the work can need longer then a special time. Is there a possibility to have more communication/information between the cinder-api and the cinder client, such as:\nRequest to attach\t->\nStill attaching\t\t<- (every 10 seconds)\nAttached\t\t        <-\n\nBR Nikolas\nPS: Can you tell me which entity in the cinder api is exactly receiving the http request? I have found the entity where cinder client starts the http request.",
