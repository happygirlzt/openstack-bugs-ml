Those links should vary depending on microversion as some\n    of the related resources did not show up until a later microversion.\n    \n    This change makes it so 'aggregates' show up at microverison 1.1 and\n    beyond and traits in microversion 1.6 and beyond. A new gabbit has\n    been added, resource-provider-links which exercises this. Only the\n    single resource provider representation is tested because the same\n    code is used for single and collection representations.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ife64922ee91a775fabdcf718e6eb0e0c7ddfde7a\n    Closes-Bug: #1693353\n",
