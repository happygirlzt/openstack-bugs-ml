The second helps with performance, but can lead to issues for deployers.  It forces large disks when sparse images could offer huge space savings.  It is especially problematic for deployments using older code that are trying to upgrade.\n\nIt makes sense to have a flag for b) s that some deployments can continue to use compressed and/or sparse images.",
