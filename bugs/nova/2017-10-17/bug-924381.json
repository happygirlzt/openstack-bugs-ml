    "description": "One issue I've run into is that there seems to now way via the API to be aware if a server is currently being imaged. One example of where this issue is exposed is creating an image of a server several times in a row. If I try this scenario:\n\n1. Make a create image request for a server\n2. Wait for that image to become active\n3. Try to take an image of the server again. I would assume that since the the first image is now active and that my server is active, this should succeed. Most of the time this request returns a 409 error with a message stating that this action cannot be taken due to the server having a vm_state of 'imaging'. This 'imaging' status isn't visible through the API, which I could see being an issue since it means there may be cases that we cannot programmatically understand the state of a server.",

            "content": "The Compute API v2 assumes we can make concurrent snapshots, so it doesn't provide a status transition for the server being imaged. So unfortunately, we won't be able to really *fix* this bug in Nova, it's a bug in the spec.\n\nSince our implementation (Nova) only allows a single snapshot to occur at any given time, you will have to depend on a mechanism defined outside of the Compute API spec: the ExtendedStatus extension. With this extension, you can access the 'OS-EXT-STS:vm_state' and 'OS-EXT-STS:task_state' attributes on each individual server (available on a detailed list or a server show).",
