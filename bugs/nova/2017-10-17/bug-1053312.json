            "content": "When an instance fails to obtain an IP address from DHCP, OVS has a port \"qvo****\" but the port cannot be seen as a bridge port. More precisely, \"ovs-vsctl show\" contains \"qvo****\" in br-int, but \"brctl show br-int\" or \"ovs-ofctl show br-int\" does not contain \"qvo****\". It is very strange behavior.\n\nWhen nova-compute launches an instance on KVM, vif driver plug() is called twice\naccorrding to the nova-compute log: http://paste.openstack.org/show/21031/.\n\nLibvirtHybridOVSBridgeDriver plug() calles nova.network.linux_net._create_veth_pair()\nto create veth pair. _create_veth_pair() checks whether the specified device exists\nand in case the device exists it first deletes the device and (re)creates it.\nIt may be a cause of the problem.\n\nAfter I changed plug() in Hybrid vif driver not to call _create_veth_pair() when the veth pair already exists, this issue is addressed. I will post a patch to apply this change soon.\n\nNote that I am not sure why plug() method of VIF driver is called twice, and the above solution may be a workaround for this bug.",
