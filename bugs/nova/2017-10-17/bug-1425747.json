    "description": "The nova API makes an implicit assumption that the \"flavorid\" field is unique, but under certain circumstances this is not enforced. This results in incorrect behavior in the situation where a deleted flavor's flavorid is re-used for a new flavor. Any instances that are associated to the deleted flavor will now appear to be associated to the new flavor that re-used the id.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n  1. Create a flavor named FOO with a flavorid of 5\n  2. Create an instance using flavor FOO\n  3. Delete the flavor FOO\n  4. Create a flavor named BAR with a flavorid of 5\n\nLook at the instance detail for the launched instance\n\nExpected Behavior:\n\nThe instance detail says the instance is launched against FOO\n\nActual Behavior:\n\nThe instance detail says the instance is launched against BAR",
