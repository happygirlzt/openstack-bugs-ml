This was needed\n    before weight normalization was in place, so that the weigher could win\n    against other weighers. Now, with weight normalization in place this is\n    not needed any more, since the maximum value that a weigher would take will\n    be 1.0 (weights are normalized between 0.0 and 1.0). We should use the\n    multiplier to get the same behavior (i.e. make the weigher prevail\n    against other weighers), the multiplier has been also increased so\n    that it actually mutes the other weighers an does not break backwards\n    compatibility.\n    \n    DocImpact: The mute_weight_value has been marked as deprecated so the\n    operators need to adjust the mute_weight_multiplier to a proper value if\n    they weren't using the defaults.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1340068\n    Change-Id: Idebd7649909567034b01ce04416ce315fb936b17\n",
