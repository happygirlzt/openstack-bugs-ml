    "description": "Lazy consensus on the mailing-list is that we should rename XenAPI virt-layer variables so they follow a consistent naming scheme. The proposal is to use\n\n1. Suffix \"_ref\" for opaque references\n\n2. Suffix \"_uuid\" for UUIDs\n\n3. Suffix \"_rec\" for record objects (the original proposal called for just 'vm', but \"_rec\" is more explicit and will maintain consistency with xenapi/plugins.\n\nTo Fix:\n\nHunt down all misnamed variables and replace according to the guidelines above. Also, include a comment that describes these guidelines in the xenapi_conn.py file so that the standard remains well-known.",
