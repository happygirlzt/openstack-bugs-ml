This means that if there is an error in the reboot\n    operation then the vm_state is left as active although\n    the instance may not be running.\n    \n    This change leaves the vm_state alone until the reboot\n    has completed\n    \n    If the reboot fails but the power_state shows that it\n    is running then we log the fault but leave it in an\n    active or rescued state\n    \n    If the reboot fails and the power_state shows that it\n    is not running then we set vm_state to error\n    \n    See also https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1183946\n    which make recovery from an Error state possible.\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1188343\n    \n    Change-Id: Idabd358d3bcaf63e21ff59188f805143dbaf9ada\n",
