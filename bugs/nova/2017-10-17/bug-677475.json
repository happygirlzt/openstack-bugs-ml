Something needs to take ownership of the failed request and take an appropriate action (set it to \"failed\" and move on with life,  or retry it at certain intervals,  or something), so I'm changing the bug title to reflect this. If you disagree, please don't hesitate to complain :)",

            "content": "This issue is only about duplicates on the surface.  The real source of the problem is that the function that generates the internal_id assumes it the field is a uint32 but the database column is defaulting to be the equivalent of int32.  So any value for internal_id that is greater than int32_max will be truncated to that value.  \n\nThe reason you see the duplicate value error is because these truncated values are all the same... but the database column is set to only allow unique values.  A big hint to this is that the error is always  \"Duplicate entry '2147483647' which is int32_max.\n\n",
