However,\n    in the case of things like InstanceList.get_by_foo(), they are\n    reporting the version of their InstanceList object, not their\n    Instance object. Conductor fills a version-matching InstanceList\n    object with brand new Instance objects, which the client, of course,\n    barfs on.\n    \n    There may be a better way to handle this going forward, but for now,\n    stop the bleeding by requiring a version bump to the corresponding\n    List object whenever the object type it contains takes a version\n    bump. This adds a test to validate that all the objects registered\n    have a suitable mapping for the current version in the tree.\n    \n    Since this actually caused a breakage in the Instance object\n    recently, this also bumps the InstanceList version so that\n    conductors running this commit (or later) will properly send\n    version 1.9 Instance objects to Havana clients and version 1.10+\n    to newer ones.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2668dead4784fbd0411d1b6372a9a8006eeb2e84\n    Related-Bug: #1258256\n    Closes-Bug: #1254902\n",
