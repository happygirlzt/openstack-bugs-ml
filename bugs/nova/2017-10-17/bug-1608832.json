    "description": "migration of shutdown instances doesn't exclude the current compute host in the conductor so given two instances with an affinity policy the host that is chosen will always be the current host which leads to an exception being generated on the compute host in prep_resize method.  This causes the migration to fail and thus place the instance in an error state.\n\nWe should modify the conductor task code to assess if the operation is a resize (in which case the same host is allowed) and if not exclude the current host (as is done for live migration).\n\nA wider issue here is the migration of instances with affinity policy, seem to me there should be some option to override it to allow for the migration of these instances.  Live Migration supports a force option but that overrides the scheduler completely which is not an ideal solution.  Cold migration provides no such option, effectively meaning the migration of instances with affinity policy is not possible when multiple instances with the same group membership exist.",
