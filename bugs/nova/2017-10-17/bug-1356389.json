We\n    no longer spawn a new VM on rescue but attach the original image and\n    boot from it. On unrescue detach the original (rescue) image.\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Radoslav Gerganov <email address hidden>\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    \n    Prior to this patch a rescue operation would create a new VM and the\n    rescue would take place on the new VM. This is prone to an endless\n    amount of problems. Some of the issues found are:\n     - unable to access the VNC console of a rescued instance\n     - unstable to suspend or resume a rescued instance\n     - rescue with ephemeral disks does not work\n    This patch now uses an inplace rescue on the same\n    VM. It is suggested that when upgrading to the latest version to ensure\n    that users are aware that a rescue during the upgrade may be problematic.\n    It is suggested that in the upgrade window that the admin prevent instances\n    being rescued and give sufficient notice to users.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3218e7edfe0f71626b2930c39dea0fba4d2e69ca\n    Closes-bug: #1356389\n",
