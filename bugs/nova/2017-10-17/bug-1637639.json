Do you need a list of BlockDeviceMapping objects [1] or just a list of attached volume ids or something else? \n\nAs a side note, adding the BDM information to the instance.update payloads means that we need an extra DB query to send the notification. In case of instance.create the bdm is available in the context of the notification sending.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/objects/block_device.py#L67-L86",

It'd be neat to get more (particularly the volume name, size and device name) but as long as it's not present in the API response the ID alone is fine.\n\nIf it requires another database query that's considered too expensive/complicated we can treat volume attachments as a special case that we need to be aware of, but the aim of these tickets is to identify those fields and preferably reduce the number we have to deal with separately.",
