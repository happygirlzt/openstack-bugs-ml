    "description": "When a host system has CPUs that are offlined via CPU hotplug, nova fails to start an instance on the host. On a test system, I've offlined CPU 31 on an Intel blade server by running the following command:\n\nsudo echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu31/online\n\nWhen starting an instance, I see the following error from libvirt:\n\nTRACE nova.compute.manager [instance: 27c5aafc-a994-4a33-b23e-287cc5be8d8b] libvirtError: Invalid value '8-15,24-31' for 'cpuset.cpus': Invalid argument\n\nThis is because CPU 31 is included in the cpuset passed to libvirt, although the CPU is offline.

Currently the libvirt driver\n    does not check if the CPUs it selects for running the instance are\n    online or offline. As a result, CPUs that are offline can become\n    part of the cpuset that is passed to libvirt. Libvirt presents\n    the following error in this case:\n    \n    libvirtError: Invalid value '8-15,24-31' for 'cpuset.cpus': Invalid\n    argument\n    \n    With this fix, the nova libvirt driver makes use of the getCPUMap\n    API in libvirt to determine if CPUs are online or offline. When\n    selecting a CPU set for running an instance, offline CPUs are\n    masked out.\n    \n    Rationale: on server platforms like s390, it is common to have offlined\n    CPUs on a host as the platform offers capabilities to run multiple host\n    operatings systems (e.g. multiple KVM hypervisors / compute nodes). CPUs\n    can dynamically be assigned to the different host operating systems, so\n    it is common to have offlined CPUs on a compute node.\n    \n    Change-Id: I506ebc9608e17e02d807e5002fe867309c22aafc\n    Closes-Bug: #1417144\n",
