    "description": "In the nova.virt.libvirt.driver.LibvirtDriver. _get_new_connection method  two different libvirt event handlers are registered, one for lifecycle events (_event_lifecycle_callback) and one for connection events (_close_callback).  These callbacks are called by a native thread that is continually calling libvirt.virEventRunDefaultImpl() in the _native_thread method; the latter method's Docstring contains the following note:\n\n        This is a native thread which runs the default\n        libvirt event loop implementation. This processes\n        any incoming async events from libvirtd and queues\n        them for later dispatch. This thread is only\n        permitted to use libvirt python APIs, and the\n        driver.queue_event method. In particular any use\n        of logging is forbidden, since it will confuse\n        eventlet's greenthread integration\n\nwhile this rule is adhered to by the _event_lifecycle_callback method, it is violated by _close_callback (the other callback) because it calls the _set_host_enabled method which, among other things, writes to the log.\n\nThe _close_callback method needs to be altered so that it does not execute any logic that may interfere with eventlet's greenthread integration.",

This change fixes the issue\n    by limiting the native thread's interaction to adding data\n    to a queue and leaving the remaining work for\n    a green thread.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1290487\n    Closes-Bug: #1293641\n    \n    Change-Id: I59c14da15e4655dc4bf21d4de3d509472b146f7a\n",
