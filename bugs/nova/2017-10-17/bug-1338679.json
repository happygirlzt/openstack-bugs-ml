    "description": "This has been observed with the VMware NSX plugin, but in theory this issue might occur with every Neutron plugin when the notifications to nova are enabled.\n\nIn a nutshell the issue is that nova needs to receive a network-vif-plugged even from neutron in order to be able to boot an instance. On the other hand in some cases VIF unplug/plug events might be fairly quick, and thus the neutron side might not be aware at all of the status change and not send any event.\n\nAs a consequence, the instance will not boot even if its VIF are correctly plugged.\n\nThis bug is currently being assigned both neutron and nova because:\n- it might deemed a plugin problem. If the plugin is not smart enough to handle VIF plug/unplug notifications than it's not worth using the notification mechanism exposed by nova\n- the nova side might add an optional poll mechanism which could run alongside the mechanism waiting for an event and periodically poll neutron to get the VIF status.",
