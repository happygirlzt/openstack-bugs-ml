So in the Ironic use case different n-cpus would share the same machines and that's what making nova confused when auditing the resources.",

Updates to additional nodes also are logged appropraitely for each additional node.\n\nAs such, I'm closing this bug. Please re-open and add more details if you can reproduce with the current code.",
