For me while launching instances using Fedora - 22 coming as Active.\n\nApproach i used to launch:\n\n1) Downloaded Fedora-22 qcow2 image from below mentioned link. size :218MB.\n\nhttps://getfedora.org/cloud/download/download-cloud-splash?file=https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/22/Cloud/x86_64/Images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2\n\n2) Launched instance with m1.nano and m1.tiny.\n\nPlease launch an instance with m1.nano. It may solve your issue.\nReason : If memory allocation not properly did, Instances may go error state.\n\nIt looks like invalid bug,  Please try above approaches and revert back to me ASAP. \n\nRegards\nNoel",
