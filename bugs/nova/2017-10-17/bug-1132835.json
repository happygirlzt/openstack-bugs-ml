I've gone back 6+ months in stable/essex and continue to get \"Ran 0 tests\" which suggests it could be an external dependency change bringing this about. I was able to narrow down a 24-hour time period by examining bitrot job logs. The last one which ran tests started at 00:00 UTC on 2012-10-30, while the one which started at the same time on 2012-10-31 ran none. Note that this issue is also affecting stable/folsom and began at the same time. Comparing the pip freeze output from these jobs, the only change I see between the last working one and the first broken one is an SQLAlchemy bump from 0.7.9 to 0.8.0b1. I'll see if I can find the corresponding fix for this in master and introduce stable backports of it shortly.\n\nThe run-tox.sh script tries to catch this scenario, but does so by inspecting the contents of nose_results.html and does not consider the absence of that file to indicate an error. I'll come up with a patch to address this so we'll start catching it again in the future.",
