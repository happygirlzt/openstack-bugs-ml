Passing urllib2.urlopener the\n    test CA certificate through the new cafile parameter allows Python to\n    verify the SSL connection, but is not compatible with prior versions\n    of Python.  Requests supports using a CA file regardless of Python 2.7\n    version.\n    \n    Once using Requests and the test CA certificate to verify the SSL\n    connection the test continued to fail because the previous certificate\n    only specified an IPv4 address, specifically in the deprecated Common\n    Name field, which is unsuitable for verifying an IPv6 address.\n    \n        Error: hostname '::1' doesn't match u'0.0.0.0'\n    \n    A new certificate was created with a wildcard in the Common Name\n    field, but primarily depends on IPv4 and IPv6 localhost names and\n    addresses in the Subject Alternative Name field to accommodate a\n    variety of test scenarios and in line with industry practices (see RFC\n    2818).\n    \n    The old CA's private key was not available to sign the new server\n    certificate so a new CA certificate was generated and it's public and\n    private keys are provided.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1404390\n    \n    Change-Id: I990d5b5b57d1b5c569aa86828364b3a762d149e1\n",
