The parameter was missing from some of the\n    extension point managers.\n    \n    Also adds a missing V3 API personality test which exposed\n    the problem with exceptions not being correctly propagated.\n    \n    Very minor spelling fix to one of the tests\n    \n    Change-Id: I53fa680cfab9219442610a5dceeb35b150314f6f\n    Closes-Bug: 1224293\n",
