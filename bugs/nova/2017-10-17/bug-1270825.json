Handle exception and create disk, but keep it single layer qcow2. (ie. without a backing file)\n4. return call back to source\n\n5. Initiate live migration\n\nNow in step 5, an incremental block copy would not work since the destination disk file would look like the source overlay file. We need to tell libvirt/kvm to do a deep copy. I don't know if this is possible with the current libvirt API. However, since qemu-img lets you rebase to any other backing file or flatten, I believe the mechanism exists.",
