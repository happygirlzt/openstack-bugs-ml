    "description": "The CPU flag pdpe1gb indicates that the CPU model supports 1 GB hugepages - without it, the Linux operating system refuses to allocate 1 GB huge pages (and other things might go wrong if it did). \n\nNot all Intel CPU models support 1 GB huge pages, so the qemu options -cpu Haswell and -cpu Broadwell give you a vCPU that does not have the pdpe1gb flag. This is the correct thing to do, since the VM might be running on a Haswell that does not have 1GB huge pages.\n\nProblem is that Nova flavor extra specs with the libvirt driver for qemu/kvm only allow to define the CPU model, either an explicit model or \"host\". The host option means that all CPU flags in the host CPU are passed to the vCPU. However, the host option complicates VM migration since the CPU would change after migration. \n\nIn conclusion, there is no good way to specify a CPU model that would imply the pdpe1gb flag.\n\nHuge pages are used eg with dpdk. They improve the performance of the VM mainly by reducing tlb size.",
