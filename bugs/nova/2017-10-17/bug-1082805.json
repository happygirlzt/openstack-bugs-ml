We added the empty file\n    ceilometer/locale/ceilometer.pot to avoid the failure of the Jenkin'\n    translation-jobs because git doesn't allow empty directory to be added\n    into the repository.\n    \n    We still need to do the following things once this patch gets accepted:\n    \n    1. Make the transifex ceilometer project\n    (https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ceilometer/) as part of the\n    openstack transifex project hub and give access to the transifex\n    openstack Jenkins account.\n    \n    2. Add the translation-jobs into openstack/openstack-ci-puppet for\n    ceilometer.\n    \n    3. Recheck and/or clean the LOG.foobar strings in ceilometer so that\n    only the useful and necessary strings would be extracted into the .pot\n    file.\n    \n    NOTE:\n    1. Don't use '_' as the variable name for \"don't care\", since it clashes\n    with gettext module.\n    \n    2. Wrap the string with the underscore function to make it ready for\n    translation, e.g.\n    \n      internationalized_string = _(\"I'm internationalized!\")\n      LOG.debug(_('I speak the language of %(language)s'), locals())\n    \n    Change-Id: I9732e424b374afa8f0650baf4e3537109e7520d1\n",

Thus, it gets quorum, and then briefly waits to see if the\n    remainder of the storage nodes respond before giving up on them.\n    \n    However, the proxy was not paying any attention to the responses from\n    the non-quorum storage nodes. This would lead to some odd behavior,\n    like a container PUT where the backends returned (201, 201, 202) would\n    become a 201 to the client, but the permutation (201, 202, 201) would\n    become 202. Further, on object PUT, if the last node responded with an\n    error code, that error wouldn't count towards error-limiting.\n    \n    The fix is quite simple: after getting quorum, the make_requests()\n    method was calling a method that returns responses from the remainder\n    of the nodes, but it was ignoring that return value and making up\n    responses with dummy values instead. Now, prior to making up dummy\n    responses, the proxy first uses the responses it already has, and only\n    fills in dummy responses for nodes that really didn't respond in time.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0206b6b2272b0e7dcc80fb6c51840d8dae25cee2\n\ncommit 315af1737be9a017a06634ae5f5ab89352e89cb5\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Sep 5 11:39:36 2014 -0700\n\n    Error limit the right node on object PUT\n    \n    If any node had an error on object PUT, the proxy would count the\n    error against the last-connected-to node instead of the one with the\n    error.

However, the '%s' format\n    isn't actually part of Python's library. Rather, Python passes that on\n    to the system C library, which is typically glibc. Now, glibc takes\n    the '%s' format and helpfully* applies the current timezone as an\n    offset. This gives bogus results on machines where UTC is not the\n    system timezone.

Before this fix, many concurrent threads would ask\n    what the pending file size is to see if they should flush\n    instead of just appending to the pending file. The problem is\n    that many would ask, find it's too big, and try to get a lock.\n    The first one wins, flushes, but all the other waiting threads\n    still think they have to flush- which is a much slower opertaion\n    than just the append. This change gets the lock first and makes\n    sure that merge_items is only called when the pending file is full.\n    \n    Change-Id: I29cfa13a48c8f7d16dd414b2288d50461adbafd2\n\ncommit 3a7f80aa472794951461cf95fac4ec029167c17d\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Aug 28 19:20:02 2014 -0700\n\n    Small Fix for FakeServerConnection\n    \n    Current FakeServerConnection might cause 499 error\n    in some unit tests because sent (put) data will be\n    overridden by new one every time.\n    e.g. When calling conn.queue.put() twice and more in\n    an object PUT sequence, we can use only a last chunk as\n    the body.

As a result of the keystone v3 API introducing\n    domains, names are no longer globally unique and are only\n    unique within a domain. The use of unqualified tenant and\n    user names in this ACL syntax is therefore not 'safe' in a\n    keystone v3 environment.\n    \n    This patch modifies keystoneauth to restrict cross-tenant\n    ACL matching to use only ids for accounts that are not in\n    the default domain. For backwards compatibility,\n    names will still be matched in ACLs when both the requesting\n    user and tenant are known to be in the default domain AND the\n    account's tenant is also in the default domain (the default\n    domain being the domain to which existing tenants are\n    migrated).\n    \n    Accounts existing prior to this patch are assumed to be for\n    tenants in the default domain. New accounts created using a\n    v2 token scoped on the tenant are also assumed to be in the\n    default domain. New accounts created using a v3 token scoped\n    on the tenant will learn their domain membership from the\n    token info. New accounts created using any unscoped token,\n    (i.e. with a reselleradmin role) will have unknown domain\n    membership and therefore be assumed to NOT be in the default\n    domain.\n    \n    Despite this provision for backwards compatibility, names\n    must no longer be used when setting new ACLs in any account,\n    including new accounts in the default domain.\n    \n    This change obviously impacts users accustomed to specifying\n    cross-tenant ACLs in terms of names, and further work will be\n    necessary to restore those use cases. Some ideas are\n    discussed under the bug report. With that caveat, this patch\n    removes the reported vulnerability when using\n    swift/keystoneauth with a keystone v3 API.\n    \n    Note: to observe the new 'restricted' behaviour you will need\n    to setup keystone user(s) and tenant(s) in a non-default domain\n    and set auth_version = v3.0 in the auth_token middleware config\n    section of proxy-server.conf.
