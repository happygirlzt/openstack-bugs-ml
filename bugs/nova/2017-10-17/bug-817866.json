(I was out for a week so I missed seeing this!)\n\nSince the default value for the flat_injected flag is True it looks to fail when trying to inject the network. I'm not a big fan of having flat_injection on by default so I may ask around and file a ticket to make that default to false.\n\nIn any case I'm able to get past this by simply setting this in my nova.conf:\n\n--flat_injected=false",
