However, cache()\n    expects it to exist when checking if a resize is required.\n    \n    This change ignores the resize check if the backing file doesn't exist.\n    This happens to be ok, because ephemeral and swap disks are always\n    created with the correct target size anyway, and therefore never need\n    to be resized.\n    \n    NOTE(mriedem): There is a slight change in the commit message and\n    test since the Raw image backend was renamed to Flat in Newton. Since\n    Flat didn't exist in Mitaka it's better to use Raw here.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1608934\n    Co-Authored-By: Matthew Booth <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I46b5658efafe558dd6b28c9910fb8fde830adec0\n    (cherry picked from commit d0775c50d0c2bd50a62ccd49ea7063948af6c3b3)\n",
