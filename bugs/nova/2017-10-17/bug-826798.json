However, if I convert the VMDK to a  raw disk, then it starts up just fine. \n\nIn testing this situation, what I did find is that KVM in general does not like compressed VDMK's. If you attempt to start up KVM with a compressed VMDK, you'll get \"no boot device found\" on the console screen. If you uncompress the VMDK (i.e. qemu-img convert compressed.vmdk -O vmdk uncpressed.vmdk), then KVM will start up just fine. \n\nEither way, VMDK's  are not working once uploaded. ",

I know that is non-trivial.  In creation of the image, we're using\n vboxmanage  convertfromraw --format vmdk --variant Standard,Stream $DISK_IMG $VMDK\n\n",
