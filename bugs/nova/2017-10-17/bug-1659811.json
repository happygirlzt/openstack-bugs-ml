    "description": "Found this while investigating why the tempest test test_list_servers_by_admin_with_specified_tenant randomly fails on Py35.\n\nThis test produces the following API call:\n\nGET /v2.1/servers/detail?tenant_id=XXX\n\nWhich calls this method in Nova:\n\nnova.api.openstack.compute.servers.ServersController.detail()\n\nIn the _get_servers() method that detail() calls, for some reason (bug ? [1]), the 'project_id' is added to the search options. So now, we see that get_all() is called with both tenant_id and project_id:\n\nSearching by: {'project_id': '74e1044b53de44d1bac80cded5146504', 'deleted': False, 'tenant_id': '153d2038e0bc4ea99819a21a55cb66ea'} get_all /opt/stack/new/nova/nova/compute/api.py:2336\n\nNow, in nova/nova/compute/api.py in the get_all() method, there's a dict called filter_mapping, that is iterated upon. I believe, based on which order the dict (i.e the search options) is iterated upon, either tenant_id or project_id gets rewritten. This leads to random return values.\n\n[1] : https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/cba26a6e561c18fa4659efac8ddc0b3c139023fe/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py#L322",
