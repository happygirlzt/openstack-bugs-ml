There were neither errors nor warning stating that security-groups argument was ignored, nothing.\n\nI checked whether security groups apply if I boot the instance with --nic net-id=$NETWORK_ID and indeed, this works as expected. So Simon is probably right.\n\nThis behavior is counter-intuitive and I still consider it a bug. Nova should have either warned me about --security-groups argument being completely ignored or add it to the list of security groups just next to the ones defined for each ports used. But in any case it shouldn't be silent.",

Moreover it first reports that the security group _is_ applied (since nova boot just shows the same output as nova show for the newly created host), but later when you check that host again you see that the security group you provided as a command-line parameter was simply ignored! And you haven't even got any warnings shown that it was ignored. That's not user friendly at all.",
