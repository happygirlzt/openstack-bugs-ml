This might make sense with the VLAN manager, altough I think there is already code in place for destroying resources on the network node, including the dnsmasq instance, when a network is delete.\n\nHowever, in FlatDHCP mode, if I'm not wrong the same dnsmasq instance is used for all networks (several IP addresses are configured on the bridge). \n",

            "content": "Hi Isaku,\n\nThanks for the bug report!  Its great to also report such issues in the Quantum project (or send email to the netstack list) as sometimes quantum developers won't see a bug that is just filed under nova.  Thankfully Salvatore noticed this one.  \n\nThis bug is specific to using DHCP / L3 NAT gateways. \n\nThe fact that LinuxOVSInterfaceDriver doesn't do anything on unplug is not actually the problem (though its something we should clean up anyway, as there will be stale linux devices lying around...).  \n\nI believe the real issue is that QuantumManager needs to clean up the \"gateway\" port on a Quantum network before attempting to delete it, otherwise Quantum refuses to to delete the network with a NetworkInUse error.  This should be a QuantumManager fix.",
