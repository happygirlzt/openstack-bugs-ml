This is caught at\n    nova.api.openstack.wsgi._process_stack and __call__.\n    \n    We also take the opportunity to move the new safe parser from nova.utils\n    to nova.api.openstack.xmlutil as the openstack api is the only thing\n    that uses it.\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1133111\n    Change-Id: Ifa2ed7ee128241cfe8dbcdc5bd75194d96b6cdb5\n",
