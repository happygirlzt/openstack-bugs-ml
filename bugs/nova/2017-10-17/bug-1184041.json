It is possible to create a set of rules using source security groups that will lead to an explosion of get_network_info calls.\n\nExample:\n\n# create a security group\nnova secgroup-create foo foo\n\n# add source group rules referencing the same group\nfor i in {1..10}; do\n  nova secgroup-add-group-rule foo foo tcp $i $i\ndone\n\n# launch 10 instances\nnova boot --flavor 1 --image precise --num-instances 10 --security-groups foo test\n\nWhen each instance boots it sends out a notification to each of the other instances to update their iptables rules. Here is what happens when the 10th instance boots:\n\nfor num instances in group that is referenced in a source rule: 10\n  for num rules referencing a source group: 10\n    for num instances in the source group: 10\n      call get_nw_info()\n\nThat means 1000 individual requests to get_nw_info for a single instance launch. In this case you have You can see how these numbers could get out of hand very quickly, for example launching 20 instances:\ninstance number(n) : num calls (n^2) * 10 \n1 :  10\n2 :  20\n3 :  90\n...\n18 : 3240\n19 : 3610\n20 : 4000\n...\n$ python -c \"print sum(n * n * 10 for n in xrange(1, 21))\"\n28700\n\n28,700 calls to get_network info by the time the launch completes. In reality this number of calls creates a DOS where nova-network can't respond in time and instance launches start to timeout.\n\nThere are multiple fixes needed:\n\na) constructing a list of all needed instances instead of making a separate request for each rule.\nb) a single call to retrieve nw_info (or at least fixed ip info) for multiple instances at once.",
