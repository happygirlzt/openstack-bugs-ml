    "description": "The calculation for LibvirtDriver._get_disk_over_committed_size_total() loops over all the instances on the hypervisor to try to figure out the total overcommitted size for all instances.\n\nHowever, at the time that routine is called from ResourceTracker.update_available_resource()  we do not hold COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE.  This means that instance claims can be modified (due to instance creation/deletion/resize/migration/etc), potentially causing the calculated value for data['disk_available_least'] to not actually reflect current reality, and potentially allowing different eventlets to have different views of data['disk_available_least'].\n\nThere was a related bug reported some time back (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/968339) but rather than deal with the underlying race condition they just sort of papered over it by ignoring the InstanceNotFound exception.",

There was some reluctance to hold the COMPUTE_RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE for long enough to calcuate an accurate value for \"vcpus_used\", \"memory_mb_used\", and \"local_gb_used\".\n\nThe end result is that with the current code we can get both false negatives (scheduler returns NoValidHost even though there actually was room), and false positives (scheduler thinks there is room, but it fails on the compute node leading to retries).",
