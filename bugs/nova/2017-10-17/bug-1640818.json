Until now, only the instance related notifications were\n    imported in the doc generation environment so the other notification\n    classes were not registered.\n    \n    This commit explicitly imports the modules that defines the notification\n    classes to make the doc complete.\n    \n    Change-Id: I269e05ddb62ec6c6cc7f7922c1344186ccf850d1\n    Closes-bug: #1640818\n",
