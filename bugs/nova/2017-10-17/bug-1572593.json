As result dns_name of port will be updated and port be attached to VM\n\u00a0- detach port from VM via nova interface-detach. As result port will be detached, BUT dns_name will be still as name of VM.\n\nif you try to attach this port to another VM you will get error, that it's not possible to attach port.\n\n\nThe same issue happens for Heat stack, when we have VM+port and execute update replace for Server.",
