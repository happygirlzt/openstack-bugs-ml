    "description": "The use of a globally configured VNC password sets the VNC password for an entire cloud. That means if one tenant knows the VNC password, they know the VNC password for all tenants. This creates an illusion of security that is more harmful than acknowledging that there is no security in the VNC traffic itself. We should therefore remove the VNC global configuration.\n\nPossible other steps to be covered in a separate bug/blueprint:\n* allow per instance passwords\n* allow per tenant passwords\n* allow strong security options using strong crypto between VNC proxy and ESX hypervisor",

This is not something that is specific to VMware and should maybe be dealt with across open stack.\nThanks\nGary",
