However,\n    this means we can't lazy-load any attributes that we need\n    when building up metadata, like when building the config\n    drive during server create. We need to pre-load the\n    device_metadata field so it's available when building\n    the config drive.\n    \n    This isn't a problem for the libvirt driver since it\n    loads device_metadata before building the config drive,\n    but the hyperv driver doesn't do that, so the change\n    above breaks hyperv when there are device tags without\n    this fix.\n    \n    Change-Id: I08b905d2734ff9d484b373369f36d48c4d056fd8\n    Closes-Bug: #1702150\n",
