A (manual) regression test showed that this is not the case\n    with master from 2015-01-22. The guest.cpu.arch is 'None' which leads\n    to the creation of a wrong device. The bug was introduced with commit\n    11a2ed096\n    \n    This fix uses the libvirt utils to decide which architecture has to be\n    considered.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1414038\n    \n    Change-Id: I97dc55e6fca0b2491d4a9bc81366f9c92d39002a\n",
