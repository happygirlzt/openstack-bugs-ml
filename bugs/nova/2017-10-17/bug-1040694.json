This was logged in Bug #954971 and a solution (using wrap_db for queries)  merged.  The  fix was  removed in Bug #967887 as it did not work with later versions of sqlalchemy.  \nAn alternative approach is to use the sqlalchemy  create_engine \"module\" parameter to override the engine behaviour and do the wrapping there.   (Mike Bayer of sqlalchemys recommended solution)   I will attach a patch which  does this",

            "content": "I think part of the topic here is that there are two ways I've proposed of retrying transactions.  The simple, easy and boring one we have is the wrap_db_retry() decorator.  The other one is an exotic event-based approach I did for a client, which I feel is pretty experimental which is over at https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/issue/3104/transaction-replay-extension , the attached patch is already in production elsewhere.   The experimental design actually records all the SQL as the transaction proceeds, intercepts a selected set of exceptions as \"good for retry\" and then replays a subset of that SQL back, namely the DML.  This is a very exotic way to go as it makes a lot of assumptions that those same INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements are still valid, even though we're in a new transaction.\n\nI have a notion that we should ultimately have all methods that start using a database transaction wrapped in a decorator that establishes this context.  The retry of the whole method should probably be rolled into that decorator.",
