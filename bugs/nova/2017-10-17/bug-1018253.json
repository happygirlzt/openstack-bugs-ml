Currently there is no error message prompt.\n\nHow to create this bug:\n1, Launch one instance.\n2. Create a first volume and a second volume.\n3. Attach the first volume to the instance at the mountpoint /dev/vdb  and succeed.\n3. Attach the second volume to the same instance at the same mountpoint /dev/vdb.\n\nExpected output:\nA message should tell user that the mountpoint is occupied, not available or something.\n\nActual output:\nNo message shows. The second volume is still available.",
