    "description": "I've encountered problems on a 2012.1 cloud migrated from 2011.3 (*not 2011.3.1*). After some investigation, I understood it was due to networks missing uuids (uuid field is NULL in networks table).\n\nFrom my understanding:\nThis uuid field was added during the Diablo release cycle, with a migration generating uuids for existing networks. Fine.\nBut : nova-manage network create was not setting uuids. This means that all networks created in 2011.3 (Diablo) have uuid=NULL. This was fixed in 2011.3.1.\n\nThe situation now is: networks created in 2011.3 (2011.3 only, not 2011.3.1) don't have uuids. On upgrade to 2012.1 (Essex), no migration ensures that uuids exist, and that is a source of problem. (In my case nova-compute was crashing when trying to launch instances which were not in the first network.)\n\nDoing a 2011.3->2011.3.1 update before moving to 2012.1 would probably not have changed anything in this case (the migration adding uuids was done when upgrading to 2011.3).\n\nDid I miss something? If not, I think it'd be worth fixing this in Essex.",

We need a place that will cover all possible cases of the use of network uuids.\nOr maybe it'd be easier to just add another database migration ensuring all networks have an uuid? Then that migration should go into the next Essex stable release so that people upgrading from Diablo (2011.3) to latest Essex get uuids for their already created networks.",
