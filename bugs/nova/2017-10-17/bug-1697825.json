This is expected.\n    \n    What's not expected is that creating entities will continue to fail for\n    quite some time, even if placement is added to the catalog. This is\n    because the keystone session caches the service catalog for some amount\n    of time.\n    \n    Therefore we need to create a new client session when EndpointNotFound\n    happens. This has been added in this change by extracting creation of\n    the report client's _client to its own method that we can call from the\n    exception handler. The resource provider and aggregate maps are wiped at\n    this time, to make sure we are starting from a clean slate. While this\n    isn't likely to cause a problem in real life scenarios, in the manual\n    testing I was doing it created issues.\n    \n    I've made the _client method synchronized so that in the unlikely event\n    that the resource tracker is trying to do its update job while some\n    other thing is happening, we won't waste the client. This may not be\n    necessary, but probably doesn't harm anything.\n    \n    Change-Id: I02ac615dc26a4a0d1fd28a638f622777e41d14e4\n    Co-Authored-By: zhangzhenzhong <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: #1697825\n",
