Since rc1 is about to be cut within hours, it makes sense to defer this fix until Grizzly. It can always be backported to stable/folsom later",

Finally, finish_revert_migration() no\n    longer uses the on-disk XML file, instead generating it via to_xml; as\n    the former lacks volume configuration.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7dccd03ef9cc7d2848f07764d4def3787e41e202\n",
