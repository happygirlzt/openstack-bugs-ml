A 404 NotFound requires\nan additional database lookup to determine that the data is actually not present, which should ideally be avoided.\n\nAlso, 404 NotFound expects the data stream to be correct(valid) but the data is just not available.\n\nFor #4, I guess a 400 BadRequest makes more sense than 413 OverLimit.\n\n",
