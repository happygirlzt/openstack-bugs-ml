Can you recreate this with master (trunk) code for Newton or at least Mitaka?\n\nIn general, Nova doesn't prevent deleting an instance, regardless of state. We don't put a global lock on an instance while it's undergoing a task or state change to avoid deleting it, since people should be able to delete their instance at any point regardless of state as long as it's not explicitly locked.\n\nBecause of this, it's possible that we have issues with orphaned resources when a delete is incomplete, so that would be what needs investigation - is anything left around or does the delete fail?",
