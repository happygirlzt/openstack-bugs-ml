Not sure if the kernel version matters in iommu_group placement. Curious about what you have on your system in which multiple VFs are placed in the same iommu_group.\n\nlibvrit XML allows specification of either 'vfio' or kvm  as the hostdev interface driver. So I think it makes sense to provide such support in nova.  As described in the bug description, this can be done\n    -- through configuration. One way to do this is to specify the driver as part of the whitelist definition. A simpler way is to specify the driver per compute node.\n    -- preconfigured table if the driver can be determined by the device model (based on vendor id and product id). This is preferred if it's possible.\n\n",
