Parent needs to deal with this more gracefully.. either by timing out queries to children.  If the scheduler is doing a select query to figure out available hosts for a build request, it should ignore zones that aren't responding.  Other queries might need to return an error.",

Was there a specific reason for the removal from novaclient as far as you're aware... Ie, people felt it didn't belong there... or ?\n\nDid you want to leave this bug assigned to yourself or want one of us to take it?",
