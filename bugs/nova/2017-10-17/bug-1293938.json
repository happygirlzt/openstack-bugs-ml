This patch merely moves three\n    static methods that were hanging from GlanceImageService and puts\n    these private functions at the module scope, where the rest of the\n    helper functions reside (these three for some reason were put as\n    static methods on the GlanceImageService instead of as private\n    functions in the module scope).\n    \n    The next series of patches will modify the unit tests in\n    nova.tests.image.test_glance to pull out usage of the fake glance\n    service and use mocks to properly stress the edges of both the\n    v1 and v2 glanceclient client structures.\n    \n    Change-Id: If998291bfdb98b1ebe2e46c4ac8fdbae0fcd4bd7\n    Related-bug: #1293938\n",

Here, we create true unit tests\n    for the GlanceImageService.show() method, stressing all code paths and\n    edges but only for that specific method, using mocks and no fake glance\n    image service.\n    \n    This patch removes \"unit\" tests from the TestGlanceImageService that\n    called glance.GlanceImageService.show(), as those tests used the fake\n    glance service and the code paths are now more than covered by these new\n    mock-using tests.\n    \n    Change-Id: I200a9e9812d6de011fa6faa8fb8dc570075ce902\n    Related-bug: #1293938\n",

What the unit tests for the glance\n    image service detail() method in Nova need is to test only the code\n    boundary that exists within the detail() method -- i.e. verify that the\n    calls to the glanceclient and other helper methods are made with the\n    right parameters.\n    \n    This patch pulls the various unit tests out of the\n    TestGlanceImageService test class and into their own test class that\n    uses mocks and verifies each code path within the detail() method.\n    \n    Next up is the create, update and delete methods of the\n    GlanceImageService class. The final piece is to rework the download unit\n    tests (which aren't unit tests but more functional tests that take\n    around a second each to run :(\n    \n    Change-Id: I94897ff54a36a1af4258ba4a3c88b45c079f4bb5\n    Related-bug: #1293938\n",

There is no need to test whether an\n    image ID that is specified in the payload to the glance image service is\n    preserved; the unit and functional tests in the glanceclient package do\n    that, and besides, all this was testing was the behavior of the fake\n    glance client, which is pointless. There was also a test that created an\n    image and then tested the show method would raise InstanceNotFound if\n    not passing in the same instance name that was just created. This test\n    was removed, as ImageNotFound is already thoroughly tested in the show()\n    unit tests.\n    \n    Missing in the existing unit tests was a test of failure conditions\n    resulting in error codes returned from the glanceclient.create() call,\n    and this patch adds a unit test that stresses the failure paths.\n    \n    These new unit tests use mocks and assert that all code paths in the\n    create(), update() and delete() methods are fully tested.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6d903979290b7d027c8dc66d2da712e1e1961a00\n    Related-bug: #1293938\n",
