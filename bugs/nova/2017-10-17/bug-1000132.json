The documentation states that the following limits are OK:\n\nlimits =(\"POST\", \"*\", \".*\", 10, MINUTE);(\"POST\", \"*/servers\", \"^/servers\", 50, DAY);(\"PUT\", \"*\", \".*\", 10, MINUTE);(\"GET\", \"*changes-since*\", \".*changes-since.*\", 3, MINUTE);(\"DELETE\", \"*\", \".*\", 100, MINUTE)\n\nSee: http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/configuring-compute-rate-limiting.html\n\nWhile setting up the limits and testing them found that they were not being decreased and the limits didn't have any real effect. After some debugging I found that the HTTP verb and the regex were not being matched because of the quotes.\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2702817\n\nLooks like you need to use POST, instead of \"POST\" and .* instead of \".*\". i.e.\n\nlimits =(POST, \"*\", .*, 10, MINUTE);(POST, \"*/servers\", ^/servers, 50, DAY);(PUT, \"*\", .*, 10, MINUTE);(GET, \"*changes-since*\", .*changes-since.*, 3, MINUTE);(DELETE, \"*\", .*, 100, MINUTE)\n\nThat works for me at least with Essex in Ubuntu Precise.\n\nOn a side note, I wonder if default limits are OK. The POST + ^/server limit isn't matched when creating new servers. Not sure if that's intended behaviour though.\n\nThanks.",
