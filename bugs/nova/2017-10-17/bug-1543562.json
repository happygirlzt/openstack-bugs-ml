This is normally done using a nova-manage script, an example of which can be seen in the following commit:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/135067/\n\nThe above patch did not add such a script and so does not provide admins with any tools to make sure their data is updated for the N release where we expect the data to be migrated as per our current upgrade policy (http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/upgrade.html#migration-policy)",
