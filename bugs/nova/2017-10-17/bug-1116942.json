Shell variables are expanded in these commands on platforms\nthat have a shell.\n\nThe full list of options and variables for .testr.conf:\n* filter_tags -- a list of tags which should be used to filter test counts.\n  This is useful for stripping out non-test results from the subunit stream\n  such as Zope test layers. These filtered items are still considered for\n  test failures. \n* test_command -- command line to run to execute tests.\n* test_id_option -- the value to substitute into test_command when specific\n  test ids should be run.\n* test_id_list_default -- the value to use for $IDLIST when no specific\n  test ids are being run.\n* test_list_option -- the option to use to cause the test runner to report\n  on the tests it would run, rather than running them. When supplied the\n  test_command should output on stdout all the test ids that would have\n  been run if every other option and argument was honoured, one per line.\n  This is required for parallel testing, and is substituted into $LISTOPT.\n* test_run_concurrency -- Optional call out to establish concurrency.\n  Should return one line containing the number of concurrent test runner\n  processes to run.\n* instance_provision -- provision one or more test run environments.\n  Accepts $INSTANCE_COUNT for the number of instances desired.\n* instance_execute -- execute a test runner process in a given environment.\n  Accepts $INSTANCE_ID, $FILES and $COMMAND. Paths in $FILES should be\n  synchronised into the test runner environment filesystem. $COMMAND can\n  be adjusted if the paths are synched with different names.\n* instance_dispose -- dispose of one or more test running environments.\n  Accepts $INSTANCE_IDS.\n* $IDOPTION -- the variable to use to trigger running some specific tests.\n* $IDFILE -- A file created before the test command is run and deleted\n  afterwards which contains a list of test ids, one per line. This can\n  handle test ids with emedded whitespace.\n* $IDLIST -- A list of the test ids to run, separated by spaces. IDLIST\n  defaults to an empty string when no test ids are known and no explicit\n  default is provided. This will not handle test ids with spaces.\n\nSee the testrepository manual for example .testr.conf files in different\nprogramming languages.\n\nsetup.py: error: no such option: -V\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 0 tests in 0.521s\n\nOK\n\n#############\n\nSuggested fix:\n\ndiff --git a/run_tests.sh b/run_tests.sh\nindex 1f269fb..fd09ce7 100755\n--- a/run_tests.sh\n+++ b/run_tests.sh\n@@ -57,8 +57,8 @@ function process_options {\n         (( i++ ))\n         tools_path=${!i}\n         ;;\n-      -*) testropts=\"$testropts $1\";;\n-      *) testrargs=\"$testrargs $1\"\n+      -*) testropts=\"$testropts ${!i}\";;\n+      *) testrargs=\"$testrargs ${!i}\"\n     esac\n     (( i++ ))\n   done\n",
