This makes it impossible to use barbican with nova without hacking some workaround\n\n\nrelease: Newton\n\n\nto reproduce:\n\n1. set api_class in nova.conf\n2. restart nova with debug\n3. see that api_class is still default\n\n\n\nWorkaround: commenting out lines 29 and 30 in __init__.py fixes the issue.",
