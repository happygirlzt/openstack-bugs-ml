    "description": "When using cells and attempting to schedule instances to a cell, this error occurs:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/40926/\n\nThis seems to be because cells is passing an instance to the db api which has dates in the form of strings instead of datetime objects. When dbapi calls .replace(tzdata=None) ... we end up using the replace() method on `unicode` and not `datetime`.\n\nThe fix for this could lie in two places:\n\n1) Detecting and converting from strings to datetime in dbapi\n\nOR\n\n2) Detecting and converting from strings to datetime in cells code\n\nI'm leaning towards #2",
