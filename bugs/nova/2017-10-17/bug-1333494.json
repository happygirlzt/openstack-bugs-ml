It because\n    agent update use the agent_id that passed from url as the response.\n    This problem is fixed by converting the agent id as integer.\n    \n    And the API sample tests provide agent_id with string type in the fake\n    data. This patch fix this problem for API sample files and tests.\n    \n    And for back-compatibility, we should add translator for v2.1 API later.\n    Then this fix will be exposed after v3 API feature exposed by microversion\n    in the future.\n    \n    DocImpact: The agent_is is changed to integer type for agents'update action.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia9c1034a325b77a2057934cc80b6eab679ff1d2b\n    Partial-Bug: #1333494\n",

This patch\n    correct the api sample files and tests.\n    \n    For agent update, it use agent_id that passed from url, make the\n    response use string for agent_id. We can't fix this problem for\n    back-compatibility.
