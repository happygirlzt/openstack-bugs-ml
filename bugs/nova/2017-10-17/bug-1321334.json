Costantino <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 22 17:18:23 2014 -0300\n\n    Check if volume is bootable when creating an instance\n    \n    Cinder provides a bootable flags for volumes that's not being\n    checked when creating an instance.\n    \n    If a user select a non-bootable volume, then the VM became unusable\n    since nothing will be booted at all.\n    \n    This check is done only in case that a volume is selected as root\n    device for a VM.  Boot from snapshot will still work (even that the\n    volume will be marked as non-bootable by cinder, but will boot the\n    attached snapshot instead)\n    If the attribute bootable is not present, we keep the old behaviour\n    and allow the instance creation.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8e028d40d6a11beeac4f043afccb17eb61f6ce62\n    Closes-Bug: #1321334\n",
