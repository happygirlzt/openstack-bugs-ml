A unit miss match between what nova and parted count\n    as a GB seem to cause the difference.\n    \n    As we just want to fill the whole disk, we can pass \"-0\" as the end\n    value, to tell parted to extend the partition to the end of the disk.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1241734\n    Change-Id: Ie4753d9de1e20561b8f96360e879075498a5ef58\n",
