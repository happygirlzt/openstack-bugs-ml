    "description": "Security Groups of a fresh project is reported as 0 (default: \"Used 0 of 10\") even though the \"default\" security group is the default security group of the project. So it should report as 1 (\"Used 1 of 10\").\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Using an admin user create a new project 'proj1' and add any user to it (role doesn't matter)\n2. Login as the user you just added to 'proj1'\n3. In Project tab select 'proj1', and then click on Overview. Security Groups under 'Limit Summary' report \"Used 0 of 10\"\n4. Click on \"Access & Security\". \"default\" security group is listed.\n\n5. Now create a new security group.\n6. Go back to Overview. Now Security Groups report \"Used 2 of 10\" (which is correct)\n\n7. If you go back and remove the security group created and come back to Overview it would show \"Used 1 of 10\" (which is correct)\n\nNOTE: Neutron should not be enabled to reproduce this bug",
