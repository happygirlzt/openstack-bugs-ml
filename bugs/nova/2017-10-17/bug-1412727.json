However , if we change the re from current to\n    r\"(.)*LOG\\.(warn)\\(.*\")\n    it will be generic. So this patch only fix existing\n    occurances and leave the hacking alone.\n    \n    The pep8 check only checks format LOG.warning but\n    it didn't check logger.warning, and nova need to translate\n    the warning messages.\n    \n    8510d3aaeeb18bdbe333d2d5d4c335f3732c4848 removed N331\n    checking so we don't need to consider warn or warning\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1412727\n    \n    Change-Id: I8834e3b397b947cb47307f1fe0f96ef4fe22b173\n",
