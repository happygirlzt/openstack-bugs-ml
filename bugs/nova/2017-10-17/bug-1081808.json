    "description": "The start_guests_on_host_boot config option ignores any/all user-requested VM state and attempts to start every VM assigned to the hypervisor in question.  This means even a VM which was suspended, paused, in error state, etc will run through the process of attempting to start.  resume_guests_state_on_host_boot provides similar functionality, except that it confirms the VM was previously in a running state prior to attempting to restart on compute startup.  \n\nI can't think of a single valid use case for this behavior.  This bug mainly serves as a tracking mechanism for removing the start_guests_on_host_boot configuration option outright.",
