When a same iSCSI protal and iqn is shared by multiple LUNs, device from other volume maybe be deleted unexpected. This is found both in Kilo and the latest code.\r\n\r\nFor example, the devices under /dev/disk/by-path may looks like below when LUN 23 and 231 are from a same storage system and a same iSCSI protal and iqn are used. ls /dev/disk/by-path\r\nip-192.168.3.50:3260-iscsi-<iqna>-lun-23\r\nip-192.168.3.50:3260-iscsi-<iqna>-lun-231\r\nip-192.168.3.51:3260-iscsi-<iqnb>-lun-23\r\nip-192.168.3.51:3260-iscsi-<iqnb>-lun-231\r\n\r\nWhen we try to detach volume corresponding LUN 23 from the host, we noticed that the devices regarding to LUN 231 are also deleted which may cause the data unavailable.\r\n\r\nWhy this happen?
