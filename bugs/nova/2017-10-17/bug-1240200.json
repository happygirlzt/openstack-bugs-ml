When nova-compute first launches, it polls the esx hypervisor for available resources and initializes the disk/memory/vcpu usage metrics with incorrect values (assumes all resources are available). Which can result in over allocation errors when provisioning new virtual machines.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. Create a virtual machine on the ESX hypervisor(using vsphere client)\n2. Launch Nova\n3. Check the \"Hypervisor Summary\" page on the dashboard\n4. Notice that the disk/memory/vcpu usage doesn't reflect the virtual machine's(from step 1) allocated resources",

The usage stats here would account for the existing instances on the ESX host/ VC Cluster. The usage stats on the Hypervisor page is the usage based on instances. \n\n\n",

            "content": "This bug needs to be broken up into a number of bugs:\n1. Disk usage:\n    i. If a datastore_regex is configured then this is not used. This leads us to reporting incorrect disk usage as the first datastore will be selected and not the actual datastore in question (I have opened bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1242638)\n  ii. the resource tracking on nova does not take into account the actual used disk space on the disk. It estimates the used diskspace (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/resource_tracker.py#L587). So for example this may not take into account (https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1242645)\n2. Memory usage:\nI think that this is the same as above. My concern here is that we may report the incorrect amount of total memory. I hope that Sabari can help out here.\n",
