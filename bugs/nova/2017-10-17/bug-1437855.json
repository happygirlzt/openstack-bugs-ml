    "description": "If a port attached to an instance has multiple fixed IPs and a floating IP is associated without specifying a fixed ip to associate, the behavior in Neutron is to reject the associate request. The behavior in Nova in the absence of a specified fixed ip, however, is to pick the first one from the list of fixed ips on the port.\n\nThis is a problem if an IPv6 address is the first on the port because the floating IP will be NAT'ed to the IPv6 fixed address, which is not supported. Any attempts to reach the instance through its floating address will fail. This causes failures in certain scenario tests that use the Nova floating IP API when dual-stack IPv4+IPv6 is enabled, such as test_baremetal_basic_ops  in check-tempest-dsvm-ironic-pxe_ssh in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/168063",
