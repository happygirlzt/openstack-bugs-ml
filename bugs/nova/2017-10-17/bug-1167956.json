            "content": "Hi Joe\n\nThanks for your comment. You're right the description is not well done.\nMy understanding of this API for the call to GET V2/os-availability-zone is that the response reports the list of availability zones skipping the \"intenal\" zone.\nAt the moment the code is not filterning the \"internal\" value for the \"not available zones\":\n        for zone in available_zones:\n            # Hide internal_service_availability_zone\n            if zone == CONF.internal_service_availability_zone:<<<<<<<<<<<<< This check is done just in the first for loop\n                continue\n            result.append({'zoneName': zone,\n                           'zoneState': {'available': True},\n                           \"hosts\": None})\n\n        for zone in not_available_zones:\n            result.append({'zoneName': zone,\n                           'zoneState': {'available': False},\n                           \"hosts\": None})\n\nThis bug can be seen with different scenario,  for example:\n1 Scheduelr service is disabled\n2 after a migration from one version/configuration to  a different one you can have some \"old\" values in the database: i.e. for nova-network services \n\nIt's not a critical bug but just one I spotted while I was looking at the code of this API extensions.\nHope this explanation make the description  clearer.\nPlease let me know. \nThanks\n\n",
