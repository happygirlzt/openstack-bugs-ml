    "description": "The utils method get_major_minor_version was being used to get the major and minor versions from the hypervisor version. This was used to determine whether the version is compatible with the required version, to then set the device_id on a vm record during vm creation.\nThis method was required by the feature: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/55117/\n\nThe method is not really required, because the hypervisor version in xen is always in the form of a tuple. This can directly be used, instead of using a utils method.\n\nThis fix will include:\n- Removing the utils get_major_minor_version method\n- Correctly handling the hypervisor version as a tuple",

However, the xen hypervisor\n    version is stored in the session product_version as a tuple.\n    This fix correctly uses the version to set the appropriate\n    device_id on the vm record. Also, removing the method\n    get_major_minor_version as it is not needed anymore.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1260178\n    \n    Change-Id: I6b1353cdb7cc856b34f02e3d3679c142ba032533\n",
