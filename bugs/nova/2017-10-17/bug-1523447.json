There is a proposal to support volume type during \"boot from image (Create new volume)\" but based on the comment on review 241065, this API will be removed in the future. Therefore, the proposal was rejected.\n\n- https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/enable-volume-types\n- https://review.openstack.org/#/c/241065/",

Nova isn't updating the boot from server functionality to allow sending a volume type since we don't want to expand our footprint in proxying other services APIs.",
