As we are using the old\n    api-paste.ini file which requires the oslo-incubator copy of request_id\n    \n    This breakage didn't happen from Icehouse -> master since the icehouse\n    api-paste.ini didn't have request_id as a middleware. request_id is only\n    used as middleware in the V21/V3 API and not the V2 API.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1383757\n    This reverts commit 641de5666f38532252e91735a1cd2611d96c489a.\n    \n    Change-Id: I1ca6bddf9d9370529e999efcc7eae60622e19e6f\n",
