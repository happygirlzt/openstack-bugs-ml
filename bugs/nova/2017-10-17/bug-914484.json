If the ISO replaces the root disk, you have to install to the ephemeral disk which cannot be captured with a snapshot.  Shouldn't think be aligned to how XenAPI works today?\n\nI think the behavior should be that it boot from ISO first but still allows for root disk and ephemeral disks to exist if set on the instance_type.",
