These\n    are checked in nova.virt.libvirt.blockinfo.get_dev_prefix_for_disk_bus\n    so they should be defined in the enum field.\n    \n    Note that there is no object compat shim for this change since before\n    ImageMetaProps, the image metadata properties could have any key/value\n    pairs, including whatever was used for disk_bus which may or may not\n    have been validated by the virt driver.  With the introduction of the\n    ImageMetaProps object, if some image properties have 'lxc' or 'uml'\n    disk_bus values we'll get a ValueError trying to construct the object\n    since those values aren't in the DiskBus enum field until this change.\n    There isn't compat logic to backport since that would mean going back\n    to the broken state and not allowing 'lxc' or 'uml' disk_bus values,\n    even though they were valid before ImageMetaProps was added.  Plus the\n    DiskBus enum field isn't versioned, so it's not like an older version\n    of ImageMetaProps with hw_cdrom_bus='lxc' won't work and we have to\n    check for it.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1471953\n    \n    Change-Id: I1060925d074f5de46c07101d7af5471fd12390cd\n",
