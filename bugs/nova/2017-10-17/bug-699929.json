            "content": "( Assuming that nova was installed on Ubuntu 10.10 system via apt-get packages from ppa )\n\nI'm not an expert on this, but I think this is a Ubuntu bug.\n\n<warning> long winded answer below </warning>\n\nDue to Ubuntu's partial move to using upstart scripts, the /usr/bin/service command is a bit schizophrenic about checking for service status. If you just issue a single status query like \n\n\t# sudo service nova-compute status\n\tnova-compute start/running, process 5408\n\nit uses the upstart config file in /etc/init/ to find out if nova-compute is running. However, if you give it the --status-all flag like this\n\n\t$ service --status-all\n        ... snip ...\n \t[ ? ]  nova-api\n \t[ ? ]  nova-compute\n \t[ ? ]  nova-instancemonitor\n \t[ ? ]  nova-network\n \t[ ? ]  nova-objectstore\n \t[ ? ]  nova-scheduler\n \t[ ? ]  nova-volume\n       ... snip ...\n\nit goes down a different code path ... which seems a bit brain dead. Instead of checking each upstart config file and then falling back to checking /etc/init.d/ startup scripts, it just checks the /etc/init.d startup script for a status command with this code:\n\n\tif ! grep -qs \"\\Wstatus)\" \"$SERVICE\"; then\n            #printf \" %s %-60s %s\\n\" \"[?]\" \"$SERVICE:\" \"unknown\" 1>&2\n            echo \" [ ? ]  $SERVICE\" 1>&2\n            continue\n\nand as the nova /etc/init.d startup scripts don\u2019t have this line (because we are simply symlink-ing to /lib/init/upstart-job which doesn\u2019t have the whitespace before the status) on line 41), we get the [ ? ] . This appears to be the case with every other upstart service also.\n\nYou can fix this by simply editing /lib/init/upstart-job and adding a single space before \u201cstatus)\u201d of line 41. When I did that and re-ran the command, I got\n\n\t$ sudo service --status-all\n\t... snip ...\n\t[ + ]  nova-api\n \t[ + ]  nova-compute\n \t[ + ]  nova-instancemonitor\n \t[ + ]  nova-network\n \t[ + ]  nova-objectstore\n \t[ + ]  nova-scheduler\n \t[ + ]  nova-volume\n       .... snip ...\n\nI recommend closing this bug and refiling it on Ubuntu 10.10's service command.",
