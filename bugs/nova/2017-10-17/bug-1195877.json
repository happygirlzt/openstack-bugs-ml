On a reboot, nova-compute checks the\n    backing images exist. Typically, they will do; however, instead\n    of looking for an \"ephemeral_XXX\" file, it hunts for \"ephemeral\".\n    This won't exist, triggering code that attempts to pull the whole\n    image again from glance(!)\n    \n    Lacking credentials, the attempt to fetch the image will fail,\n    ultimately resulting in the instance going to an ERROR state.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iabcc7a1ffd248c22a747a1ddc7863d2b386d409a\n",
