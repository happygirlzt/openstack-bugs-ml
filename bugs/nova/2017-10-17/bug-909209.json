Either floating IPs are part of an extension, and so core nova shouldn't be returning them there, or the core nova API can pass that info along to the consumer.\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/addresses.py#L43\n\nShould I open a bug \"nova core doesn't work without the os-floating-ips extension\"?",
