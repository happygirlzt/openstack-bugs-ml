    "description": "I'm using the nova docker driver on RHEL 3.10.11-1.el6.x86_64 (rebuilt kernel). Based on the format of /proc/mounts on RHEL, the cgroup devices path cannot be found.\n\nOn my box the line in /proc/mounts for cgroups looks like this:\n\nnone /sys/fs/cgroup cgroup rw,relatime,perf_event,blkio,net_cls,freezer,devices,memory,cpuacct,cpu,cpuset,clone_children 0 0\n\nIn the docker driver the method which searches /proc/mounts for the cgroup path looks like this:\n\n    def _find_cgroup_devices_path(self):\n        for ln in open('/proc/mounts'):\n            if ln.startswith('cgroup ') and 'devices' in ln:\n                return ln.split(' ')[1]\n\nTherefore the method cannot find my cgroup path. I hacked around this with a 1 LOC change to the _find_cgroup_devices_path method which looks for 'cgroup' as the 3rd item in the line split:\n\nif ln.split(' ')[2] == 'cgroup' and 'devices' in ln:\n\nThe update method in its entirety looks like:\n\n169     def _find_cgroup_devices_path(self):\n170         for ln in open('/proc/mounts'):\n171             if ln.split(' ')[2] == 'cgroup' and 'devices' in ln:\n172                 return ln.split(' ')[1]\n\nBased on the format in /proc/mounts on my ubuntu box, this change *should* work on ubuntu as well as rhel.\n\nI did read that docker is only supported with devstack + unbuntu, so I realize this defect may get deferred or even closed. However I wanted to surface it as I believe future efforts of openstack + docker will need to consider non-ubuntu + devstack envs.",
