Several doc string blocks have to be fixed as part of this to get\n       the docs tox job to pass.\n    2. A docstring in vhdutilsv2 is updated to remove the math directive\n       since that requires the sphinx.ext.pngmath extension which requires\n       latex and dvipng packages from the distro - which is overkill for\n       what the docstring was actually doing with the math directive.\n    3. We exclude autodoc for tests since we don't really care about\n       docstrings on unit tests.\n    4. We exclude the nova.wsgi.nova-* modules since those won't build with\n       autodoc since they can't be imported (there is no\n       nova/wsgi/__init__.py module). We could arguably add the __init__.py\n       but it's not really necessary for what those scripts are used for.\n    5. The sphinx.ext.ifconfig extension is removed since there are no docs\n       that use the ifconfig directive.\n    6. Update the developer docs to explicitly point out that graphviz must\n       be installed prior to running tox -e docs.\n    7. Hide doc/source/api/autoindex.rst from the toctree so that we don't\n       regress the point of commit bd7e62f796fe951fd42c2edad56e252a0b7393c8.\n    8. unused_docs and exclude_trees options are removed from conf.py since\n       they are deprecated in Sphinx 1.2.3:\n    \n       https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/blob/1.2.3/sphinx/config.py#L54\n    9. Fix imports for moved libvirt volume options.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1471934\n    \n    Change-Id: I946e2f89f2c9fc70e870faaf84e4a8b0fc703344\n",
