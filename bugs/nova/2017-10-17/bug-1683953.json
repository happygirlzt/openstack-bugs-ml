Sometimes the test times out entirely and fails.\n    \n    This changes the test to mock BackOffLoopingCall and raise the timeout\n    exception to simulate a timeout. The only thing not covered by this is\n    calling of the _wait_state() function, but that is covered by other\n    unit tests in the file.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1683953\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie3ff6b0020dca8a5f5292b327aa2491920e338ef\n",
