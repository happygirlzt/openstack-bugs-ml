Also, you have to run with the DB2 patch for sqlalchemy-migrate posted here:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/sqlalchemy-migrate/issues/detail?id=151\n\nAnd you must run with the ibm-db/ibm-db-sa drivers:\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/ibm-db/source/clones?repo=ibm-db-sa\n\nWe're trying to get the sqlalchemy-migrate support for DB2 accepted in the icehouse timeframe but need to show the migrate maintainer that he can use the free express-c version of DB2 in ubuntu for the test backend.\n\nAnyway, having said all that, fixing the DBDuplicateEntry translation is part of the story so I'm opening a bug to track it and get the patch up to get the ball rolling.",
