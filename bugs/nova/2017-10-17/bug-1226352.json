    "description": "versions: essex (2012.1) and grizzly (2013.1)\n\nThe use of \"_set_instance_error_state\" function seems to be inconsistent in nova/compute/manager.py. For example, when a \"nova boot\" command fails, the VM may end in ERROR state due to the use of \"_set_instance_error_state\". If a \"nova reboot\" fails, however, \"_set_instance_error_state\" is not called and VM will not be set to ERROR. \n\nWe think that the VM should be set to ERROR in both cases.",
