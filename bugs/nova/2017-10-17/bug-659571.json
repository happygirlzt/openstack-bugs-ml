    "description": "Initially I discovered that the --storage_dev flag for nova-volume was not doing anything, and then after doing some research I saw that the whole support for physical volumes was removed during the ORM merge (revision 275 http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hudson-openstack/nova/trunk/revision/275).  This merge removed the nova/volume/service.py and attempted to move all of the functionality to the driver.py and manager.py.  But the chunk of code that uses storage_dev and runs pvcreate and such was all lost.  As best I can tell this was not intentional.",
