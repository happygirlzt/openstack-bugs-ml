    "description": "The function nova.utils.sanitize_hostname() sanitizes instance names to\nmake them suitable for use as host names. Among other things it contains\nthe function truncate_hostname() that truncates host names to a maximum\nlength of 63 characters. Unfortunately this truncation does not take\ninto account the host names' domain part (DEFAULT/dhcp_domain in\nnova.conf).\n\nConsequently, a 63 character host name plus a domain part (e.g.\n`.novalocal`) will yield a 73 character net host name passed to\ncloud-init inside the instance, which can cause problems with host name\nsetting code (this can prevent instances from deploying properly, see\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1432758 ).\n\nThe Heat project has code to handle this kind of problem, but it's more\nof a stopgap measure:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/heat/commit/8ac7fa02063386a8eb73380d83261f7174781383\n\nI think the better place to fix this is Nova. Unlike Heat, Nova knows\nthe domain name it uses and can truncate host names enough to leave room\nfor the domain name.",
