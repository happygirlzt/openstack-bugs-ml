It's all very fragile since the check\n    in the report client is dependent on a regex for the\n    error message coming back from the Placement API, but until\n    we have error codes in the API responses, this is what we\n    have to deal with.\n    \n    This change puts the original error message back in the\n    Placement API and adds notes for awareness.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9a9af0e3e04c7ea7314b7077a681d6a111de6e47\n    Closes-Bug: #1708031\n",
