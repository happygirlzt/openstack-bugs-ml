    "description": "In git commit a79ecbe Russel Bryant submitted a partial fix for a race condition when booting an instance as part of a server group with an \"anti-affinity\" scheduler policy.\n\nThat fix only solves part of the problem, however.  There are a number of issues remaining:\n\n1) It's possible to hit a similar race condition for server groups with the \"affinity\" policy.  Suppose we create a new group and then create two instances simultaneously.  The scheduler sees an empty group for each, assigns them to different compute nodes, and the policy is violated.  We should add a check in _validate_instance_group_policy() to cover the \"affinity\" case.\n\n2) It's possible to create two instances simultaneously, have them be scheduled to conflicting hosts, both of them detect the problem in _validate_instance_group_policy(), both of them get sent back for rescheduling, and both of them get assigned to conflicting hosts *again*, resulting in an error.  In order to fix this I propose that instead of checking against all other instances in the group, we only check against instances that were created before the current instance.",
