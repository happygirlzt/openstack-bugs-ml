However when we delete the instance, the PF is not makred as available.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1) Whitelist PFs and VFs in nova.conf (as explained in the docs) for example\n\n    pci_passthrough_whitelist = [{\"product_id\":\"1520\", \"vendor_id\":\"8086\", \"physical_network\":\"phynet\"}, {\"product_id\":\"1521\", \"vendor_id\":\"8086\", \"physical_network\":\"phynet\"}] # Both pfs and vfs are whitelisted\n\n2) Add an alias to assign a VF pci_alias = {\"name\": \"vf\", \"device_type\": \"type-VF\"}\n3) Set up a flavor with an alias extra_spec\n\n    $ nova flavor-key 2 set \"pci_passthrough:alias\"=\"vf:1\" \n\n4) Boot an instance with the said flavor and observe a VF being set to 'allocated' and a PF being set to 'unavailable' \n\n    select * from pci_devices where deleted=0;\n\n\n5) Delete the instance from step 4 and observe that the VF has been made available but the PF is still 'unavailable'. Both should be back to available if this was the only VF used.",
