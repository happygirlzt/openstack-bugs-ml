This same image metadata is then passed to the selected compute manager for processing the request.\n\nRight now the compute manager completely ignores the image metadata and tries to obtain it only if the instance is booted from an image.

Right now, that\n    info is ignored and the compute node has fetches the image metadata\n    again from glance if booting from an image. This is a problem when\n    booting from a volume, because most of the properties that the volume\n    keeps when it has been created from an image won't be considered.\n    \n    With this patch, the image metadata passed to run_instance from the API\n    will be used if present instead of asking glance again.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4680d9d309d7a09f64d52ef0fb105282ace79e5f\n    Closes-Bug: 1281973\n",

This was needed to be\n    able to get the image_metadata attached to a volume, when booting from\n    it. That change didn't consider that the image name key is not inherited\n    when creating a volume from an image and introduced a bug when creating\n    the usage_info for volume booted instances.\n    \n    This change fixes this by only attaching the image name to the usage_info\n    only when booting from an image and not when booting from a volume.\n    \n    Related-Bug: 1281973\n    Change-Id: I8ec441e7815855a94a28c4566790d5144deff16f\n",
