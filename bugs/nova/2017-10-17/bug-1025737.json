    "description": "The scheduler hints extension converts a server create request like {'server': {'name': 'foo'}, 'os:scheduler_hints': {'near': 'bar'}} to {'server': {'name': 'foo', 'scheduler_hints': 'bar'}}. If the extension is off, that conversion does not take place. However, a user can explicitly set the 'scheduler_hints' value inside the 'server' dictionary when the extension is off and the data will be consume by the core api controller.\n\nI would expect when the extension is off that any scheduler hints would be ignored.",

            "content": "As the extension code will be executed before servers.py, I didn't think out a good method to distinguish whether the \"scheduler_hints\" in request body is set by the schedule hints extensions or by user directly.\n\nI considered that it's possible that the schedule hints extension set the req's environment, like followed draft show. With this changes, even user set the \"scheduler_hints\" in the server dictionary, it will not be utilized. The servers.py always get scheduler hints from the wsgi environment.\n\nHowever, I'm not quite sure if this is the right and clean solution, because I'm not sure if the wsgi environment fits for this purpose. Although my quick test showed it works. \n\nBrian, how do you think of this? If it's acceptable, I will do more testing on it.\n\nThanks\n--jyh\n\ndiff --git a/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/scheduler_hints.py b/nova/api/op\nindex 86b7564..d97d0bd 100644\n--- a/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/scheduler_hints.py\n+++ b/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/scheduler_hints.py\n@@ -46,7 +46,7 @@ class SchedulerHintsController(wsgi.Controller):\n     @wsgi.extends\n     def create(self, req, body):\n         hints = self._extract_scheduler_hints(body)\n-        body['server']['scheduler_hints'] = hints\n+        req.environ['nova.scheduler_hints'] = hints\n         yield\n\n\ndiff --git a/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py b/nova/api/openstack/compute/\nindex 0b37b5c..42a5036 100644\n--- a/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py\n+++ b/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py\n@@ -678,7 +678,7 @@ class Controller(wsgi.Controller):\n             min_count = max_count\n\n         auto_disk_config = server_dict.get('auto_disk_config')\n-        scheduler_hints = server_dict.get('scheduler_hints', {})\n+        scheduler_hints = req.environ['nova.scheduler_hints']\n\n         try:\n             _get_inst_type = instance_types.get_instance_type_by_flavor_id\n~\n",
