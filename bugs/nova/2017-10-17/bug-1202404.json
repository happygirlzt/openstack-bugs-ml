The initial\n    implementation called create_tags which uses per-instance metadata.\n    However, we can't update per-instance metadata while an instance is still\n    building because put the metadata updates in the messaging queue.\n    \n    We avoid this problem by using system_metadata instead of per-instance\n    metadata. As an added bonus, users can't tamper with the token via the tags\n    API.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1202404\n    \n    Change-Id: I8ff28d75154a30fe3b521926453b9e9cbdd9fead\n",

In other words,\n    multiple RunInstances call with the same client token will\n    not start up multiple instances.\n    \n    This adds a test for this condition, including ensuring that\n    a new instance is spawned when a client token is re-used\n    after the original instance linked to it has been terminated.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1202404\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia11eb9ac082a623a1ad03b89fb6dbf7cad9f9c99\n",
