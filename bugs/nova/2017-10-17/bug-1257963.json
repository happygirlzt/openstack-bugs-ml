    "description": "I have a multi host environment set to fancast DNS entries to all of the hosts.  The problem I'm seeing occurs because we have two different DNS  domains.  Some hosts are running dhcp_domain=x.novalocal and others y.novalocal.  When the fancast occurs, instance names are attached to the dhcp_domains of the destination host. This is not always correct.\n\nFor example, I spawn an instance named \"a\" in the x.novalocal domain and on that host the dns resolves as a.x.novalocal on it own host which is correct.  On a host that is configured for y.novalocal domain the DNS resolves as a.y.novalocal which is incorrect.\n\nThe workaround is to setup some external DNS if I want resolution between hosts.",
