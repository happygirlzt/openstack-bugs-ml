This enables the use of\n    application-agnostic tools, e.g. global logging configurations. See\n    http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/oslo-specs/specs/juno/app-agnostic-logging-parameters.html\n    \n    This patch syncs the latest context module from oslo-incubator and use\n    it as the base class for Cinder RequestContext. The goal is to clean up\n    Cinder code, and to be ready for the first oslo.context release.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iba9354b402de556ca6e55e7c17dd6f3f1624d72d\n    Related-bug: #1210261\n",
