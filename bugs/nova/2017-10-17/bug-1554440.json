With microversion 2.20, attach a volume to the server. Since the server doesn't have a host, this is all just information stored in the database and the bdm.device_name is None.\n4. List/Show volume attachments for the server using the os-volume_attachments API - that results in a 404 error here because the bdm doesn't have a device_name set:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/volumes.py#L311",
