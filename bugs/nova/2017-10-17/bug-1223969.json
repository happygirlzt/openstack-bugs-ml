A previous attempt to fix this issue missed the\n    more important call.\n    \n    It's actually more efficient to not load the system_metadata when getting\n    the list and allow the 1 instance to lazy load.  For the cached instances,\n    we will ask for system_metadata when getting a fresh copy from the DB.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1223969\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib95e868135ed2b36af7ddbcfb8d5905bfe14d1fe\n",
