This results in\n    allocate_fixed_ip() attempting to invoke an RPC on a non-existant host.\n    \n    Secondly, the test is attempting to remove a fixed IP which was never\n    allocated. Use the add_fixed_ip() test to allocate a fixed IP and then\n    remove that one, which is 10.0.0.3 rather than 10.0.0.2 which is the\n    IP reserved for VPN.\n    \n    Lastly, disable the instance DNS manager because it seems this isn't\n    compatible with multinic. I was getting FloatingIpDNSExists raised.\n    \n    blueprint: oslo-messaging\n    Related-Bug: #1213251\n    Change-Id: I9854863bbec8834c638c55832411f63da570f82d\n",
