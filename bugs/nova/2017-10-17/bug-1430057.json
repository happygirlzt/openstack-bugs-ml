Concurrently, from another node, I run a script that tried to live-migrate the instance to another host (every 1.2 seconds).\nMost of the times messages were something like 'cannot migrate instance in state VERIFY_RESIZE', but, when live-migration succeeded the instance was stuck in MIGRATING status and needed a `nova refresh --active` command.",
