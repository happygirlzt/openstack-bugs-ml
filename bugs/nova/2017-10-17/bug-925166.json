Not all of these places are avoidable, e.g., some of the SQLAlchemy query construction calls or the mox calls, or certain assignments\u2014but many of these are, through judicious use of parentheses.  (In some places, the parentheses, brackets, or braces may even already exist!)  We should clean these up throughout nova.",
