    "description": "This applies only when the nova/neutron event reporting mechanism is enabled.\n\nIt has been observed that in some cases Nova spawns an instance without waiting for network-vif-plugged event, even if the vif was unplugged and then plugged again.\n\nThis happens because the status of the VIF in the network info cache is not updated when such events are received.\nTherefore the cache contains an out-of-date value and the VIF might already be in status ACTIVE when the instance is being spawned. However there is no guarantee that this would be the actual status of the VIF.\n\nFor instance in this case there are only two instances in which nova starts waiting for 'network-vif-plugged' on f800d4a8-0a01-475f-bd34-8d975ce6f1ab. However this instance is used in tempest.api.compute.servers.test_server_actions, and the tests in this suite should trigger more than 2 events requiring a respawn of an instance after unplugging vifs.\n\nFrom what can be gathered by logs, this issue, if confirmed, should occur only when actions such as stop, resize, reboot_hard are executed on a instance.",

At what point should the \"network_info\" cache be updated? Can someone point me in the right direction, please? Thank you.",
