The utility function\n    handes InstanceNotFound exceptions and tranlsates them to HTTPNotFound\n    rather than letting them propagate up causing a traceback.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Michael Still <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I1e69fed0c7c0c611fcfd48abbd4b4e0b1c8b403f\n    Closes-Bug: 1271146\n",
