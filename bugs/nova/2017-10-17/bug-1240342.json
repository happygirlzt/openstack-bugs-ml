    "description": "Currently, some tests in ec2/test_api.py fail if boto version is between 2 and 2.14:\n\nIn boto version < 2.14.0 -> method new_http_connection takes exactly two arguments\nIn boto version = 2.14.0 -> method new_http_connection takes exactly three arguments\n\nIf the unit tests use boto version 2.14.0, all tests pass.\nIf the unit tests are run with a version of boto < 2.14, tests fail with the error: \"new_http_connection does not take 2 or more positional arguments\"\n\nThis is because the comparison done using pkg.parse_version is incorrect.\nFor eg. version 2.13.3 is incorrectly computed as being greater than 2.14\nThis causes the wrong number of arguments to be expected to be called. (in this case, 3 instead of 2, which causes the test to fail)",
