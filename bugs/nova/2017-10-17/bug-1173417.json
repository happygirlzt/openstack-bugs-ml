Looking at the NetworkManager code it if a race happens at the code level, then an exception will be passed back which will stop the instance from continuing to build.",

The default is 0 for no retries to\n    match the current behavior.\n\n    The network allocations currently get retried by a full retry of a build\n    via the scheduler, if those are enabled.  This patch reduces the need to\n    re-schedule for simple network allocation issues.\n\n    The retrying happens in the network alloc async greenthread, so for virt\n    drivers that support the new NetworkModel, the retrying potentially\n    happens in the background while the image is being downloaded, etc.",
