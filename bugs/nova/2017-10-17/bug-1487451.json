    "description": "Changes in PCI device configuration is not reflected in the database (pci_stats).  After nova reboot, pci_stats still hold stale data.  This happen only when the compute as at some point interfaces configured with PCI SR-IOV or passthrough (in the pci_passthrough_whitelist) and then all those interfaces are removed.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Configure SR-IOV on an interface and edit nova.conf/pci_passthrough_whitelist accordingly.\n2. Start nova on the compute.\n3. Remove the SR-IOV interface and it's configuration in nova.conf.\n4. Restart nova on the compute.\n5. Validate that pci_stats still hold the PCI device information by looking at the SQL database.\n\nThis behavior cause the scheduler to still try to schedule an instance on the compute that had PCI configured even since no PCI device are availalble.",

Object of type PciDevicePoolList are evaluated\n    like a list, thefore a conditional statement like 'if pools' will always\n    evaluate to False even if 'pools' is not None.\n    \n    Without this fix, if 'pci_passthrough_whitelist' is cleared in the\n    configuration, nova scheduler still think a compute node has PCI devices\n    available and can still trigger scheduling an instance with PCI devices on the\n    node.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib3c19d569b9b3b23a293ad55dd9023291435d5a6\n    Closes-Bug: #1487451\n",
