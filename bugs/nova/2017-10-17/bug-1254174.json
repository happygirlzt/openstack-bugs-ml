    "description": "The bulk-create-floating-ip and bulk-delete-floating-ip commands do not interact with floating_ip quotas.  This is by design, since they're for admins rather than tenants.\n\nHowever, in one case this causes a bug.  If a tenant initially allocates the floating IP with create-floating-ip and consumed quota, and the admin later deletes the floating Ip with bulk-delete-floating-ip, the floating IP is freed but the quota is still consumed.\n\nSo we should change bulk-delete-floating-ip to release any quota that was associated with those floating IP addresses.  (In many cases there will not be any so we need to check.)\n\nThis is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1029756 (but that bug is mostly private so won't people outside Red Hat much good).",

But it can also be used to destroy other\n    (not auto_assigned) floating IPs, in which case the previously used\n    quota was not recovered.  This fixes the quota leak in that unusual\n    case.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1254174\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibff80d9ebac8d4422e401909033da12d9ec0b593\n",
