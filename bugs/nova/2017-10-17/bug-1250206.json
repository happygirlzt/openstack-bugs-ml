Due to this, the\n    notification emitted to signify that the delete finished was\n    getting emitted without a deleted_at value.\n    \n    This change uses the result from the instance_destroy call to\n    update the Instance object with the latest state from the database.\n    Thus, the compute.instance.delete.end notification is emitted\n    with the proper deleted_at value.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1250206\n    Change-Id: I55ed37cf89dd6eb8ea901c6f813191a0ce1058e8\n",
