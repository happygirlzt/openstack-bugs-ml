Mitchell <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jul 30 15:59:08 2012 -0500\n\n    Fix image_type=base after snapshot\n    \n    When an instance is snapshotted, the resultant image should have the\n    image_type property set to \"snapshot\".  However, if the base image\n    already had image_type set to \"base\", the image_type on the snapshot\n    will also be set to \"base\".  This turns out to be because we set\n    image properties in two different places.  The first is when the\n    image record is created in glance, which occurs in\n    nova.compute.api:API._create_image(); this is when image_type is set\n    to \"snapshot\".  However, in nova.virt.xenapi.vm_utils:upload_image(),\n    all the properties from the base image are copied over, so all the\n    properties set by _create_image() could be overwritten.\n    \n    The quick solution was to extend the non_inheritable_image_properties\n    configuration setting to also cover the image properties set by\n    _create_image().  Long-term, these two metadata-setting processes\n    need to be more closely unified.  (It should be noted that the\n    upload_image() function contains a TODO stating that the code should\n    move into the compute manager, so it can be shared across\n    hypervisors\u2026)\n    \n    Fixes bug 1031079.\n    \n    Change-Id: I936bc147fb823eca67e40084cba5c3bc1a7fe73a\n",
