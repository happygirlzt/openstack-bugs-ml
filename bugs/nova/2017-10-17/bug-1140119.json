    "description": "Remaining instance['instance_type'] uses should be removed and replaced with sys_meta\n\nRecently, a change caused the instance type information to be copied into system_metadata, decoupling a running instance from the system flavors. This allows both changing of flavor details as well as deleting flavors without affecting running instances. Further, having the information in system_metadata will allow us to eventually remove the joinedload of the instance_types table at instance fetch time.",
