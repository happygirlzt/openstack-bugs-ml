    "description": "Calling nova-dhcpbridge with the FLAGFILE environment variable set should cause nova-dhcpbridge to read that file for configuration flags.  This is important because nova-dhcpbridge is passed to dnsmasq in nova/network/linux_net.py and alternate configs are passed to it via the FLAGFILE env variable.  nova-dhcpbridge is reading the FLAGFILE variable but not using it for configuration parsing.  This appears to be a regression introduced in 00786bc554a2dfacb3c6f02fbb7e9c98f35d4262.",
