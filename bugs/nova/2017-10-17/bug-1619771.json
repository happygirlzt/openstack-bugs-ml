This was\n    probably caused by the refactoring that create _send_inventory and\n    _send_inventories and a lack of sufficient test coverage.\n    \n    Fixing this involves changes in both the placement api service, and\n    in the (thus far) only existing client, the scheduler reporting\n    client used in the resource tracker. The reporting client can be a\n    bit simpler now because of the cleaner behavior in the api.\n    \n    Tests have been updated accordingly.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3af1c7686a45c1a0d70fe704d3c7938810eff6a3\n    Closes-Bug: #1619771\n",
