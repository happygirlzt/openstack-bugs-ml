I need specify command line, so we can get if the instance is volume back end etc\n2 what 's your storage using ? seems you mentioned in #2 you are using ceph rbd?\n3 what nova client command you are using to do the snapshot? image-create  or volume-snapshot-create\n\nI hope you will provide enough information next time when you reporting a bug.\nit will save both our time to reproduce and will easy for the issue addressing process.\n\nthanks Eli.",
