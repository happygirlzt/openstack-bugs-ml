As expected the test files should not be present.\n* Create a second set of post-rebuild test files.\n* Shut down the instance from inside itself - \"shutdown -h now\".\n  - relevant note - bug was *not* triggered by a soft restart.\n* Start the instance again from Horizon.\n* Log in. The post-rebuild test files will no longer be present, the pre-rebuild test re-appear. Has reverted to pre-rebuild state.",
