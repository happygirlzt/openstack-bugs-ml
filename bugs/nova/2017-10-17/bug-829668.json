This is problematic because when a regular user accesses the servers api, all servers are returned for all users of a tenant, which makes it hard to tell who created what.\n\nSimilarly, when admin users access the api, all servers for all tenants are returned.  Without server.tenant_id, administrators cannot sift through the server list very easily.",
