This is the result of the bugfix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1461970 .\n\nThe problem is that the destroy instance can occur before snapshoting, resulting in a VM NotFound exception being raised while snapshoting, as the VM no longer exists. In the logs it can be observed that the lock was being held by \"do_terminate_instance\", which was then aquired by \"instance_synchronized_snapshot\".\n\nThis causes failures in some tempest tests.\n\nLogs: http://paste.openstack.org/show/421642/",
