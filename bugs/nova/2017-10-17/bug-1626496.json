This means whatever `str` is in either\n    python 2 or 3, but never `unicode`. When they are not mod-wsgi\n    will 500. For the most part this is taken care of by webob, but in\n    the case of the 405 handling, the webob response is not being\n    fully massaged.\n    \n    mod-wsgi is doing this because it supposed to. Python WSGI server\n    gateways have different expectations of headers depending on whether\n    the Python is 2 or 3. See\n    \n    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#a-note-on-string-types\n    \n    In addition to the unit test, the gabbi tests are now using a\n    version of wsgi-intercept that will raise a TypeError when the\n    application response headers are not using the correct form. This\n    check needs to be done in wsgi-intercept rather than the gabbi tests\n    because both wsgi-intercept and the http client makes requests\n    transform the headers for their own purposes.\n    \n    This fix ensures that instead of a 500 the correct 405 response\n    happens.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1626496\n    Depends-On: I3b8aabda929fe39b60e645abb6fabb9769554829\n    Change-Id: Ifa436e11e79adc2e159b4c5e7d3623d9a792b5f7\n",
