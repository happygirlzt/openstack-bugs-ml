This should not be happening since the smallest subnet in IPv6 is theoretically a /64 (the last 64 bits are part of the host address). \nRadvd (which is used by nova-network) also requires as /64 for autoconf at the client(instance) side.\n\nCommand used: \nnova-manage network create novanet --fixed_range_v4=10.153.200.0/24 --fixed_range_v6=2001:6f8:1477:1111::/64 --num_networks=1 --network_size=250 --bridge=br100 --bridge_interface=eth0\n\n\nI'm not saying smaller subnets shouldn't be possible, but if you specify a /64 subnet (or larger) it should remain so.",
