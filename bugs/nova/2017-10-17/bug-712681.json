Ever since paste.deploy was introduced, although FLAGS.pidfile exists, it doesn't do anything anymore for the bin/* programs.\n\nTwo bugs are evident:\n\n* FLAGS.pidfile should be removed. It is obselete and confusing for users who see it on the --help output\n* No documentation exists for using the configuration file examples in etc/ (for instance, the etc/nova-api.conf file).\n\nYou can control the pidfile used in startup by using paster. Since Nova is now using paste.deploy, you can refer to this documentation on starting/stopping/reloading server daemons with paste.script:\n\nhttp://pythonpaste.org/script/\n\nCheers,\njay",
