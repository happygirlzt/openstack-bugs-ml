If an image does set\n    it up on its grub configuration, the instance may not boot properly.\n    \n    Nova is setting the os_cmdline for other hypervisors, so it should do\n    the same for Xen. This way libvirt will configures the domain properly.\n    \n    [1] https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_FAQ_Console\n    \n    Change-Id: I7600c6e966ab3829185d008077463e9689b9afd5\n    Closes-Bug: 1691190\n",
