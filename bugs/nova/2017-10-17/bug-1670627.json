At this point quota usage\n    has been incremented in the main 'nova' database.\n    \n    When the instance is deleted, the build request is already gone\n    so _delete_while_booting returns False and we lookup the instance\n    in cell0 and delete it from there, but that flow wasn't decrementing\n    quota usage like _delete_while_booting was.\n    \n    This change adds the same quota usage decrement handling that\n    _delete_while_booting performs.\n    \n    NOTE(mriedem): This change also pulls in some things from\n    I7de87dce216835729283bca69f0eff59a679b624 which is not being\n    backported to Ocata since in Pike it solves a slightly different\n    part of this quota usage issue. In Pike the cell mapping db_connection\n    is actually stored on the context object when we get the instance\n    from nova.compute.api.API.get(). So the fix in Pike is slightly\n    different from Ocata. However, what we need to pull from that Pike\n    change is:\n    \n    1. We need to target the cell that the instance lives in to get the\n       flavor information when creating the quota reservation.\n    \n    2. We need to change the functional regression test to assert that\n       the bug is fixed.\n    \n    The code and tests are adjusted to be a sort of mix between both\n    changes in Pike without requiring a full backport of the 2nd\n    part of the fix in Pike.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4cb0169ce0de537804ab9129bc671d75ce5f7953\n    Partial-Bug: #1670627\n    (cherry picked from commit 018068c4caac324643c7c6a4360fad855dd096eb)\n",
