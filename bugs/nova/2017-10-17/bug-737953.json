    "description": "The detail method at the OpenStack API image service (nova.api.openstack.images) doesn't return all attributes about an image, it only returns a limited subset of atrributes: status, id, name.\n\nIt seems that there's a legacy hack in the code in order to return only information about an s3 object store. See revision 495 http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hudson-openstack/nova/trunk/revision/495 and the explanation at: https://code.launchpad.net/~tr3buchet/nova/os_api_images/+merge/44634\n\nNow that the glance/local image services are working, can we drop the hack and return all attributes?",
