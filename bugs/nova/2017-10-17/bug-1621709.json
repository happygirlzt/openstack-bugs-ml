Which leads to leak\n    allocations record in the DB. The cases for leaking:\n    \n    * When execute resize, the instance is moved to another host and the\n    instance.host is changed to the new host. But RT only update the\n    instance which instance.host is on the same host. It leads to the\n    allocation record on the source host leave in the DB.\n    * The instance was deleted locally when the compute node is down. After\n    the compute node back, the related allocations record can't be cleanup.\n    \n    This patch add new method for the scheduler client. It will remove all\n    the allocations records for the instance which isn't on the host.\n    \n    Change-Id: I28884c4edac8825a4753449f1b6e1eddded0d52b\n    Partial-Bug: #1621709\n",
