    "description": "The VMware driver establishes connections to vCenter over HTTPS, yet the vCenter server certificate is not verified as part of the connection process.  I know this because my vCenter server is using a self-signed certificate which always fails certification verification.  As a result, someone could use a man-in-the-middle attack to spoof the vcenter host to nova.\n\nThe vmware driver has a dependency on Suds, which I believe also does not validate certificates because hartsock and I noticed it uses urllib.  \n\nFor reference, here is a link on secure connections in OpenStack:\nhttps://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/SecureClientConnections\n\nAssuming Suds is fixed to provide an option for certificate verification, next step would be to modify the vmware driver to provide an option to override invalid certificates (such as self-signed).  In other parts of OpenStack, there are options to bypass the certificate check with a \"insecure\" option set, or you could put the server's certificate in the CA store.",
