The curent approach\nmakes this a derived setting of either \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cwritethrough\u201d based\non the support of O_DIRECT. Whilst this provides a good set of default\nsettings it removes the ability of the cloud provider to use other\nmodes such as \u201cwriteback\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d which are valuable in certain\nconfigurations.\n\nThis change allows the cache mode to be specified on a per-disk type\nbasis.
