The change to get_instance_type_by_flavor_id is suspicious since that call is used via the flavors API directly to show flavors (to admins and non-admins) alike.\n\nThis appears to be a valid test failure.... If I understand this correctly we just need to revert the change to get_instance_type_by_flavor_id and we should be fine.",
