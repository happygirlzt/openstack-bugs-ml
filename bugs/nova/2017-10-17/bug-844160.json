It was only used\n    by zone boot.\n    2) compute API's create() no longer creates Instance DB entries. The\n    schedulers now do this. This makes sense, as only the schedulers will\n    know where the instances will be placed. They could be placed locally or\n    in a child zone. However, this comes at a cost. compute_api.create() now\n    does a 'call' to the scheduler instead of a 'cast' in most cases (* see\n    below). This is so it can receive the instance ID(s) that were created\n    back from the scheduler. Ultimately, we probably need to figure out a\n    way to generate UUIDs before scheduling and return only the information\n    we know about an instance before it is actually scheduled and created.\n    We could then revert this back to a cast. (Or maybe we always return a\n    reservation ID instead of an instance.)\n    3) scheduler* calls do not return a host now.  They return a value\n    that'll be returned if the caller does an rpc.call().  The casts to\n    hosts are now done by the scheduler drivers themselves.\n    4) There's been an undocumented feature in the OS API to allow multiple\n    instances to be built. I've kept it.\n    5) If compute_api.create() is creating multiple instances, only a single\n    call is made to the scheduler, vs the old way of sending many casts. All\n    schedulers now check how many instances have been requested.\n    6) I've added an undocumented option 'return_reservation_id' when\n    building. If set to True, only a reservation ID is returned to the API\n    caller, not the instance. This essentially gives you the old 'nova\n    zone-boot' functionality.\n    7) It was requested I create a stub for a zones extension, so you'll see\n    the empty extension in here. We'll move some code to it later.\n    8) Fixes an unrelated bug that merged into trunk recently where zones DB\n    calls were not being done with admin context always, anymore.\n    9) Scheduler calls were always done with admin context when they should\n    elevate only when needed.\n    10) Moved stub_network flag so individual tests can run again.\n    \n    * Case #6 above doesn't wait for the scheduler response with instance\n    IDs. It does a 'cast' instead.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic040780a2e86d7330e225f14056dadbaa9fb3c7e\n",
