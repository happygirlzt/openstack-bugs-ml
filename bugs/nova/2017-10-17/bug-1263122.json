Previously it was not possible to use\n    devstack's unstack.sh because the service module would always\n    restart under a SIGHUP, not only when the process was running as\n    a service. SIGHUP on a non-detached process should act like\n    SIGTERM. This change fixes that.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib260d82519fde5c5cb24a2c0c8a7cccd0b96b84f\n    Related-Bug: #1263122\n",
