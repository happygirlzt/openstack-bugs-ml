The -f (force) flag is already being passed to lvremove, which has no effect.  The failure whose log I've pasted below occurred on a system which uses device mapper, with lvm layered on top.  In order to be able to delete the volume, it needs to be removed from device mapper via dmsetup remove so that lvm stops considering the device open and allows removal.\n\n-- Log --\n\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp Traceback (most recent call last):\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/rpc/amqp.py\", line 252, in _process_data\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     rval = node_func(context=ctxt, **node_args)\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/manager.py\", line 173, in delete_volume\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     {'status': 'error_deleting'})\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py\", line 24, in __exit__\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     self.gen.next()\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/manager.py\", line 162, in delete_volume\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     self.driver.delete_volume(volume_ref)\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/driver.py\", line 172, in delete_volume\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     self._delete_volume(volume, volume['size'])\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/driver.py\", line 128, in _delete_volume\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     run_as_root=True)\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/volume/driver.py\", line 83, in _try_execute\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     self._execute(*command, **kwargs)\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/utils.py\", line 245, in execute\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp     cmd=' '.join(cmd))\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp ProcessExecutionError: Unexpected error while running command.\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp Command: sudo nova-rootwrap lvremove -f nova-volumes/volume-00000002\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp Exit code: 5\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp Stdout: ''\n2012-04-11 04:11:32 TRACE nova.rpc.amqp Stderr: '  Can\\'t remove open logical volume \"volume-00000002\"\\n'\n\n-- Log --\n\nEssex final, Ubuntu 11.10 (64-bit).",
