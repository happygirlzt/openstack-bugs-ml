    "description": "When trying to use horizon to set various port ranges for icmp, nova api rejects various forms of the icmp request.\n\nThe ICMP port rule should take a type and a code.  The type and code are independent and should not follow the validation of udp and tcp that require to_port > from_port.  Also, the type and code values may be 0.  The api code doesn't support this and returns errors.",
