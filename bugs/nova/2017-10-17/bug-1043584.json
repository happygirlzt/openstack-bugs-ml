However, after it has finished launching and you navigate away from the instances screen and then back to it, the \"Keypair\" field is set to \"Not available\".\n\nI am unsure if this is a security \"feature\" or a bug. If it is as designed, the text should be changed to something more descriptive such as \"set\" or otherwise obscured to let the user know that there was a keypair set for the instance at launch.\n\nI run into this error repeatedly with Devstack (single server) on trunk (#b177299).",
