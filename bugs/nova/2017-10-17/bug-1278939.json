    "description": "The fix for bug #1243195 added upper-bound checking for flavor fields based on sys.maxint.  The problem is that the value of maxint varies by platform (either 32- or 64-bit signed integers), while the INTEGER type in databases is limited to 32-bit signed integers.  This means that the upper-bound checking does not work on platforms where sys.maxint returns the maximum value of a 64-bit signed integer.  The original reported problems (as shown in http://paste.openstack.org/show/48988/) persist on 64-bit platforms.",
