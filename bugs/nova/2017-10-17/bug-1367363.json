    "description": "Shutting down a libvirt-lxc based instance will leak the nbd device. This happens because _teardown_container will only be called when libvirt domain's are running. During a shutdown, the domain is not running at the time of the destroy. Thus, _teardown_container is never called and the nbd device is never disconnected.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Create devstack using local.conf: https://gist.github.com/ramielrowe/6ae233dc2c2cd479498a\n2) Create an instance\n3) Perform ps ax |grep nbd on devstack host. Observe connected nbd device\n4) Shutdown instance\n5) Perform ps ax |grep nbd on devstack host. Observe connected nbd device\n6) Delete instance\n7) Perform ps ax |grep nbd on devstack host. Observe connected nbd device\n\nNova has now leaked the nbd device.",

This was happening because\n    _teardown_container would only get called if the domain was\n    present. After this fix, _teardown_container will always get called\n    on a destroy, which ensures the nbd device gets disconnected.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8d0044fd038fef80568c6c86e34719ef679aa890\n    Closes-Bug: #1367363\n",
