The traceback is added\n    to the exception message. If recreating the exception fails for whatever reason\n    then a RemoteError is created containing all of the exception information.\n    \n    Adds flag 'allowed_rpc_exception_modules' to prevent dangerous modules from\n    being accessed and allowing arbitrary code to be run.\n    \n    Fixes bug 920705\n    Fixes bug 940500\n    \n    Change-Id: Ife3b64b19fe8abbc730184d4ee7d9fcabfd29db3\n",
