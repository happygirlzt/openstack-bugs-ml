It seems that deleted_at is being set in the database, but the final notification for a deleted instance is emitted without it. It is important that the final notification for an instance be sent with up-to-date details as it is potentially the last notification that will be sent.\n\nSample Notification: http://paste.openstack.org/show/48702/",

This meant that services listening to notifications for\n    instance state changes could potentially never get the instances\n    deleted_at value. The instance usage audit notification would be\n    the only source for that value.\n    \n    This change returns the destroyed instance from the conductor API\n    and sends the delete.end notification with that state, containing\n    the deleted_at value which was just set.\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    Closes-Bug: #1241681\n    Change-Id: I3481e0bada1711c3bff50f249f6a2b40a4ea6855\n",
