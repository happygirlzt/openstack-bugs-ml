To err on the side of caution though, I intentionally did not change 5 instances of timeutils.strtime in the production path code (vs the unit tests) to be revisited later.\n\n    https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.isoformat\n\nThat said, I like a combination of both of our approaches: isoformat when it's safe, and an explicit '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f' in the production code path when there's some doubt about remaining backwards compatible. I'll update my patch to combine both approaches and add you as an additional author.",

I'm sure there must have been some kind of discussion at the time of deprecation.",
