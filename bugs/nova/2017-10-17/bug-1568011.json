The client may, at its option, choose to redirect to that location.\n\nWhen getting a /servers/{id} there is a 'bookmark' link. When getting that link the v2 and v2.1 links are present in the choices. Seems like it would make sense to put the v2.1 link in the location header to express the preference.",
