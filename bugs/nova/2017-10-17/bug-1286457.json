We caught this with docker-ci, but\n    only after it was merged.\n    \n    This patch makes get_available_resource a public\n    method again, removing the _ prefix.\n    \n    This is a partial revert for change:\n        58d7eeede1e2912ab250fd306c85ca1a05de2fbc\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1286457\n    \n    Change-Id: I07cede8e1ebf606988aeec5bb4d65a9c5ebfe20b\n",
