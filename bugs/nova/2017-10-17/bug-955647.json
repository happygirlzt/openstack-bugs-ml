    "description": "We recently updated one of our test clusters, and the default scheduler changed to FilterScheduler. This cause problems because free_ram_mb for each of our (havily oversubscribed) compute notes was a negative number, which means the RamFilter didn't allow instances to schedule any more. I haven't been able to quickly identify why free_ram_mb was negative, but I'll circle back around and provide more details when I can.",
