    "description": "When the SMBFS volume backend is used and a volume is detached, the according SMB share is detached if no longer used.\n\nThis can cause issues if at the same time, a different volume stored on the same share is being attached as the according disk image will not be available.\n\nThis affects the Libvirt driver as well as the Hyper-V one. In case of Hyper-V, the issue can easily be fixed by using the share path as a lock when performing attach/detach volume operations.\n\nTrace: http://paste.openstack.org/show/256096/",
