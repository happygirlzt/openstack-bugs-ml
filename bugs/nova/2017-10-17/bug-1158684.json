The only current workaround would be\n    to set update_policy:AUTO and not make any changes to the server\n    which results in server replacement (or do 2 stack updates using\n    a transition ip_address).\n    \n    Likewise, update_policy:AUTO will need to be set on any port\n    consumed by resources which don't support update without replacement\n    (such as OS::Neutron::FloatingIP and OS::Trove::Instance)\n    \n    Change-Id: I558db6bac196f49e5c488a577f0580c934b06747\n    Closes-Bug: #1301486\n    Related-Bug: #1158684\n    Related-Bug: #1369748\n",

Ivar's work-around is preferable for at least two reasons: 1) It is independent of the core plugin whereas this would only work with ML2, and 2)  Nova should not be deleting the port (and/or policy target) when it was created externally to Nova.\n\nOnce the Nova bug is fixed, we should change schema so the port_id foreign key is no longer be set to null on delete.\n",

This behavior is not correct\n    since the user has preallocated the port object and will\n    expect it to only be unbound from the server on delete.\n    \n    This patch allow the existing port to be unbound from the instance\n    on server delete whereupon the port will still exist but not\n    be associated with the instance in neutron (note the '--nic\n    port-id' opt is only supported with neutron). The patch also\n    adds unit tests to verify the behavior + changes.\n    \n    This patch also moves instance.info_cache.delete() to be called\n    after _shutdown in the compute manager as shutdown calls\n    deallocate_for_instance so the info_cache is still needed at this point.\n    \n    Based on original work from Aaron Rosen <email address hidden>\n    for which you can see a stale patch review here:\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/77043/\n    \n    UpgradeImpact:\n    \n    Existing applications that created neutron ports and assigned them to a running\n    instance or to a instance that is created will need to be aware\n    that they are now respponsible for the deletion of the ports and that these\n    ports will not be deleted by nova when the instance is destroyed.\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Aaron Rosen <email address hidden>\n    Co-authored-by: Davanum Srinivas <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia5367cf064d40690670ffeac3c1f16998464c234\n    Closes-bug: 1158684\n",

Different network implementations may\n    want to handle how logical to physical network interface assignment\n    happens. To do this the new API calls into new functions on the network\n    implementation loaded for the specified node.\n    \n    This is part 1 of 3, and adds four new functions vif_attach, vif_detach,\n    vif_list, port_changed, portgroup_changed, get_current_vif to the base\n    network interface class, which should be overridden by network interface\n    implementations.\n    \n    DHCP provider update_mac_address method was deprecated, network\n    interface port_changed() and portgroup_changed() should be used instead.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Vasyl Saienko (<email address hidden>)\n    Change-Id: I0b84cfd85557d18254697f2e539c583ea0f8e88c\n    Partial-Bug: #1582188\n    Closes-Bug: #1158684\n",
