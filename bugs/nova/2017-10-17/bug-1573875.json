    "description": "Hi,\n\nI've faced a strange problem with nova.\nA few enviromental details:\n - We use Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n - We use Kilo from Ubuntu cloud archive\n - We use KVM as Hypervisor with the stocked qemu 2.2\n - We got Ceph as shared storage with libvirt-rbd devices\n - OVS neutron based networking, but it's all the same with other solutions I think.\n\nSo, the workflow, which need to reproduce the bug:\n - Start a Windows guest (Linux distros not affected as I saw)\n - Live migrate this VM to another host (okay, I know, it's not fit 100% in cloud conception, but we must use it)\n\nAs happend then, is a really wrong behavior:\n - The VM starts to migrate (virsh list shows it in a new host)\n - On the source side, virsh list tells me, the instance is stopped\n - After a few second, the destination host just remove the instance, and the source change it's state back to running\n - The network comes unavailable\n - The horizon reports, the instance is in shut off state and it's definietly not (the VNC is still available for example)\n - User can click on 'Start instance' button, and the instance will be started at the destination \n - We see those lines in a specified libvirt log: \"qemu-system-x86_64: load of migration failed: Invalid argument\"\n\nAfter a few google search whit this error, i've found this site: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu/+bug/1472500\nIt's not the exact error, but it's tells us a really important fact: those errors came with qemu 2.2, and it's had been fixed in 2.3...\n\nFirst of all, I've installed 2 CentOS compute node, which cames with qemu 2.3 by default, and the Windows migration started to work as Linux guests did before.\n\nUnfortunately, we must use Ubuntu, so we needed to find a workaround, which had been done yesterday...\n\nWhat I did:\n - Added Mitaka repository (which came out two days before)\n - Run this command (I cannot dist-upgrade openstack now): apt-get install qemu-system qemu-system-arm qemu-system-common qemu-system-mips qemu-system-misc qemu-system-ppc qemu-system-sparc qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils seabios libvirt-bin\n - Let the qemu 2.5 installed\n - The migration tests shows us, this new packages solves the issue\n\nWhat I want/advice, to repair this:\n - First of all, it would be nice to install qemu 2.5 with the original kilo repository, and I be able to upgrade without any 'quick and dirty' method (add-remove Mitaka repo until installing qemu). It is ASAP to us, cause if we not get this until the  next weekend, i had to choose the quick and dirty way (but don't want to rush anybody... just telling :) )\n\n - If nova able to start instances two times with same rbd block device, it's a really big hole in the system I think... we just corrupted 2 test Windows 7 guest with a few clicks... Some security check should be implementet, which collects the instances (and their states) from kvm at any VM starting, and if the algorithm sees, there are guest running with the same name (or some kind of uuid maybe)  it's just not starting another copy...\n\n - Some kind of checking also would usefull, which automatically checks and compare the VM states in the database, and also in hypervisors side in a given interval (this check may can be disabled, and checking interval should be able to configured imho)\n\nI've not found any clue, that those things in nova side are repaired previously in liberty or mitaka... am I right, ot just someting avoid my attention?\n\nIf any further information needed, feel free to ask :)\n\nRegards, \n Peter",
