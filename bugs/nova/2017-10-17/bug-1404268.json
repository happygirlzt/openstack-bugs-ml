The request context is passed around explicitly in many chunks of OpenStack code.

The nova logger will use an explicitly passed context, or look for it in the local.store. \n\nA recent change in community openstack code has resulted in the context not being set for many nova log messages during spawn:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1372049\n\nThis change spawns a new thread in nova/compute/manager.py build_and_run_instance, and the spawn runs in that new thread.

This change adds a\n    hacking check to assert this is being done during pep8.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id52c30bb5ded2184d772e6026b0f04f9a0efeb55\n    Related-Bug: #1404268\n    Closes-Bug: #1468513\n",
