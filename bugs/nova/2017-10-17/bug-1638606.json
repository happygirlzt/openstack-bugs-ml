The user_id has never been returned in the list\n    response. The docs were a bit confusing for create and show since\n    they said 'New in version 2.10' for the user_id description in the\n    response.\n    \n    This change clarifies the response docs so that we don't make it\n    sound like user_id is only getting returned for create/show with\n    microversion 2.10 and removes user_id from the response docs for\n    the list operation.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4bd06c8ed88e526f44bb0d6e927c09175bf103b1\n    Closes-Bug: #1638606\n",
