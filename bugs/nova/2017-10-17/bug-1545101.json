The metadata server is an AWS construct, and given the\n    implementation order of APIs in Nova (ec2 was the first API) it shares\n    code with the ec2 base classes. But it's the ec2 API we were\n    deprecating out and deleting.\n    \n    Removing these breaks anyone upgrading using the metadata server, as\n    was seen by the neutron multinode job.\n    \n    In addition, paste filters should *never* return a response code\n    directly. Doing so means they block processing the rest of the\n    pipeline. Which means that the deprecation approach that was used here\n    actually forcably broke anyone with existing deploys.\n    \n    Change-Id: I22eb3a3fcd8e74a1d9085acde15c25a927ae12cb\n    Closes-Bug: #1545101\n",
