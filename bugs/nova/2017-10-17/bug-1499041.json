It is possible to set the flags in a way\n    that every live-migration will be a block-migration and vice versa.\n    This doesn't make sense and is a misconfiguration.\n    \n    Because some customers could already have configured their systems in\n    this faulty way, this patch set logs a warning if it discovers this,\n    instead of blocking the nova-compute service to come up.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1499041\n    Change-Id: I37f1e90c8a86a1dcf0fc1e699a018e0784c66e48\n",
