    "description": "Today libvirt driver in Nova names instance folders according to instance name (e.g., \"instance-001\"), which is not unique. Using the uuid of the instance instead will make it much easier to handle several scenarios,  including migration (verify availability of the instance on the target node), as well as instance rebuild for HA (for similar purpose, when shared storage is in place).\n\nThe fix is mainly replacing instance['name'] with instance['uuid'] in a bunch of places in libvirt/driver.py.\nHere is fix propose: https://review.openstack.org/9707",
