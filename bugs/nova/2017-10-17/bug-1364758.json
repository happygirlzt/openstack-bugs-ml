    "description": "The def _get_all_instance_metadata() at https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L2885 contains the logic for filtering a list of instances. The problem is, it also contains nova-specific code, e.g. policy checking. This method is being used by describe_tags of the EC2 API too. In an effort to add more resources (e.g. voumes, volume snapshots) to the EC2 API, the filtering logic needs to be abstracted out into a common function for all resources (e.g. get_all_resource_metadata).\n\nAnother issue is, the functioning of this filtering logic is only minimally tested in nova's core code. Strangely the filtering logic is extensively tested in the EC2 API tests, which is the wrong place to test them. As a part of fixing this bug, unit tests to test this new common function should be added too.",

To make this filtering logic usable for filtering\n    metadata of other resources, it is being moved to utils.py file. The\n    filtering metadata logic is going to be used for filtering volume and\n    volume snapshot metadata in the EC2 API, at the very least.\n    \n    There were no unit tests present at all to test the filtering logic.\n    Those have been added too, and in the process of writing unit tests,\n    a bug was found: a single character value of a resource metadata\n    (e.g. 'c') matches when a filter is specified which contains\n    that character as a part of input matching string (e.g.\n    all resources which has a metadata value = 'taco')\n    \n    The bug has also been fixed, and accompanying testcase added\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1364758\n    Closes-Bug: 1365887\n    Change-Id: Ie9dbb50b79c042e49ef7eaba831280e175cc1e7f\n",
