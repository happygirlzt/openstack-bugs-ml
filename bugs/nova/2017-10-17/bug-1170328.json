    "description": "Currently if one attempts to put a VM into rescue mode and the operation fails. The VM is set to vm_state.ERROR.\n\nAs a customer/end user, if I attempt to put my VM in rescue mode and it fails, I would like it to stay in ACTIVE mode so that I can pursue other repair options, such as reboot or migrate.\n\nIf it's in ERROR status, only someone with admin api access can get it out again. For me (the end user) that means more down time while I find an admin to help me.\n\n----\n\nIf a rescue attempt fails, the VM's state should return to what it was before the rescue attempt started, and the user should be notified of the failure.",
