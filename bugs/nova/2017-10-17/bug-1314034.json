Let me explain this bug:\n\nFor a VM it has UUID and name, for example:\n\nIn openstack:\nVM --------> UUID: 84f763a5-45cd-496a-8d49-b035118d60da\n                     Name: vm_in_vcenter\nIn vCenter:\nVM--------->UUID: 84f763a5-45cd-496a-8d49-b035118d60da\n                    Name: 84f763a5-45cd-496a-8d49-b035118d60da\n\nIn vmware driver, it uses two method:\n_get_vm_ref_from_uuid(session, instance['uuid']) or _get_vm_ref_from_name(session, instance['name'])\n\nPlease note the second method, it trace VM through instance['name']. But the instance['name'] is actually like \"instance-00000002\".\nUsually the first method will work but it will go wrong if the first method didn't return a value.\n\nAs Tracy Jones said, in vCenter the vm_name==vm_uuid, if we expect that the first method always work then the second method is unnecessary.\nIf we expect the second method works in case the first go error, it should be modified.
