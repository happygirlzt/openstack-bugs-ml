    "description": "This isn't really a bug per se, but more of a nuisance.\n\nCurrently, when we run `run_tests.sh -p` it will output pep8 errors that contains the actual line of source code plus a 10+ line description of exactly what happened.\n\nThis is nice info to have (especially for newcomers to the project), but once you're familiar w/ the pep8 tool, this information overload becomes distracting. Moreover, if you have a lot of pep8 errors (say you're just now checking your long-lived feature branch), the output can be almost unusable.\n\nTo fix this, I'm proposing adding a new option to `run_tests.sh` called `--short-pep8` (or `-S`) which provides abbreviated pep8 info.",
