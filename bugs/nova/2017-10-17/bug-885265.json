I believe our current plan is to consider the build of a VM failed if we cannot attach it to the network.   \n\nMy understanding is that it is perfectly valid for a service like Quantum to define its own error codes within the 4XX range, so I don't think that is the fundamental problem.   Its really just that I should have done a better job of error handling :)   ",
