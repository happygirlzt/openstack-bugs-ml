    "description": "It's great that the Placement API v1.4 provides a way to query for hosts that can fulfill a set of allocations. However, because the max_unit doesn't account for allocation_ratio, the result is not as expected.\n\nFor example, my host has a total of 4 vCPU and 2 vCPU have been allocated. cpu_allocation_ratio is 3. I expect that this host is considered a qualified host if I make a request to the <placement api>/resource_providers?resources=VCPU:5 because Capacity = (total-reserved) x allocation_ratio - used which is 10. However, because the max_unit is set as the total which is 4, my host is not in the response although it can fulfill the requested allocation.",

If your machine only has 4 CPUs and you expose that as 5 CPUs to a guest, you'll get pathologically bad performance as the guest tries to optimize workloads across those, which are causing cache flushes in the CPUs below.\n\nDefinitely in the Won't Fix category",

This is why max_unit gets set to what it is set at.\n\nNote that if you requested a new guest with 4 VCPUs, it would get placed. max_unit describes the limit per guest, where allocation_ratio modifies the limits overall. So you can oversubscribe as much as you like across many guests, but not per individual guest (as that would cause the pathological performance Sean describes).",
