This test\n    intermittently fails as the host paramter of the instance doesn't match\n    sometimes. The reason is that the compute manager during shelve offloading\n    first sets the state of the instance then later sets the host of the instance.\n    So the test can start unshelving the instance before the host is cleaned by\n    the shelve offload code.\n    \n    The test is updated to not just wait for the state change but also wait for\n    the change of the host attribute.\n    \n    Change-Id: I459332de407187724fd2962effb7f3a34751f505\n    Closes-Bug: #1704423\n",
