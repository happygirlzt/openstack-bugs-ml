There's support for this position here: http://<email address hidden>/msg04930.html\n\nIn addition, there may be multiple attached volumes at different mount points, and finding out which ones you need to mount and inject files into is non-trivial.  While it is solvable, it will be complex code, and it's probably too late for this amount of new functionality to land in Havanna at this point in time due to its complexity.\n\nI propose a simpler fix to skip the file injection attempt for booted volumes for now which will speed up instance creation (but WARNing the operator), and addressing this further in Icehouse.\n",
