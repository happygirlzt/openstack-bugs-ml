When the VM is deleted the volumes created are not detached - attached to None.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Create a VM (creating a new volume) and attach 2 volumes to it.\n2. Create a snapshot of the VM.\n3. Set the volume quota to 5.\n4. Create a new VM based on the snapshot from step 2.\n5. VM will get into error state but when it gets removed volumes will still be associated with 'None'.\n\nExpected:\nInstance deleted and volume detached.\n\nActual:\nInstance deleted and volume attached to 'None'.\n\n\nIn our deployment - which is stable/ocata - we had an issue with the bug #1668267. Maybe this is related to this.\n\nFor sake of completeness, we are running Openstack with ceph.",
