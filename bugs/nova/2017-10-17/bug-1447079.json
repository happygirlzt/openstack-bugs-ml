Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Apr 22 11:40:29 2015 +0100\n\n    libvirt: mark NUMA huge page mappings as shared access\n    \n    When a guest is configured to use huge page backed memory,\n    these mappings should be marked as shared. This allows a\n    external process connected to a vhostuser VIF type to\n    access the guest RAM segment.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1447079\n    Change-Id: I1136929d921cdb915de6553e6f0f93e7b29b547e\n",
