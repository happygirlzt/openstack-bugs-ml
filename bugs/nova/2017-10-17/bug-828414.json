The drawback of using greenthread instead of multiporcessing is that, we will experience a very inefficient response from the two WSGI servers (NOVA & EC2) on average. Instead, we should start them using multiprocessing so that we can exploit multiple CPU cores. It is just my opinion\n\nThanks.\n\nAhmad\nHewlett-Packard",
