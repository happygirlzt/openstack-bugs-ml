The _get_host_sysinfo_serial_os function in libvirt driver treats empty file the same as missing file and throws NovaException in both cases. This change was made as part of https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1475353.\nHowever, if the sysinfo_serial config option is set to 'auto', the driver only checks for the presence of file when choosing to report 'os' serial. If the file is present but empty, this throws NovaException instead of falling back to reporting 'hardware' serial instead.\n\nFiling this bug to treat empty and missing file as the same in _get_host_sysinfo_serial_auto function in libvirt driver (similar to _get_host_sysinfo_serial_os).\n\nSteps to reproduce\n==================\n1. Empty the contents of /etc/machine-id file on a KVM host.\n2. Set sysinfo_serial option in nova.conf to 'auto' (default).\n3.
