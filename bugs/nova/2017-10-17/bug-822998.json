    "description": "It so happens that many of the virt layer tests pass around and receive network_info. This network_info is arbitrarily hardcoded on the spot and then run through the tests. The problem is these hardcoded \"network_info\"s are not necessarily accurate, and if the format of network_info changes, the tests will continue to use incorrect values which will cause false positive results in our testing framework.",
