When the unrescue takes place the rescue disk\n    will not be deleted.\n    \n    The patch adds unit tests that validates that the rescue disk location\n    is correct.\n    \n    Change-Id: I17dfcade0a162057219bc6d108987bec53f526f9\n    Co-authored-by: Vui Lam<email address hidden>\n    Closes-bug: #1293435\n",
