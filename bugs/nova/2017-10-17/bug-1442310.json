The data received from Cinder already contains instance ids. The only reason Horizon does a separate call to Nova is that he needs to get these instances' names (and possibly some other metadata). Asking the Nova to filter the instance list by volumes seems like a duplication of work to me ('cause we already know these instances), passing just instance ids would suffice.\n\n2. Most likely Cinder doesn't know about instances' names, that's why Horizon does a request to Nova. This architecture is okay IMO, because each OpenStack component should do its _own_ job, with Horizon aggregating the data across many components just for the user's convenience.",

Apply the same behavior for Volumes tab (both Admin and\n    Project). This patch both saves us from making unnecessary and\n    potentially expensive call to Nova and lays the ground for a more\n    selective request of instance details from Nova. The latter will be\n    possible once Nova supports filtering instance details by >1\n    instance_id.
