Are you reporting a bug for the issue that is triggering the \"unicode object has no attribute get\" error or are you simply saying that that error itself is a bug and should be more descriptive?

Finding out why something fails, should not require adding --debug and dig through large number of texts, which, if you're not fluent in Python, is not that much better.\n\nThe error should have been [something like]:\n\n  The server is currently unavailable. Please try again at a later time.\n\nThis is already available in the message, just not shown to the user.\n\nHowever, that is only marginally better than the original error message. It would be better to know WHAT server that's \"currently unavailable\". Without knowing in depth, grepping configs etc, etc, I have no idea what server/service is listening on the port mentioned (\"8774\" in this case).\n\nSo a better message should be:\n\n  The Nova compute service is currently unavailable.
