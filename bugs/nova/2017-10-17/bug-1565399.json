    "description": "This error can occur when resizing vm and resource tracker are executed at the same time.\n\nThe cause of this bug is that the file path of a VM disk is changed temporarily when resizing.\n(from /var/lib/nova/instances/[UUID]/ to /var/lib/nova/instances/[UUID]_resize/)\n\nThe _get_instance_disk_info method which gets a total disk size that all instance uses is executed periodically in resource_tracker.\nAt that time, the os.path.getsize() method which gets a file size is executed.\n\nIt is just a speculation, but the os.path.getsize() method consists of these steps.\n\n 1. open the file by using a fopen method in C\n 2. get the status of file by using a stat method in C\n \nAt that time, if the file path of a VM disk is changed between 1. and 2., a errno.ESTALE will occur.\nSo we have to take into account the OSError(errno.ESTALE) in order to avoid above error.\n\nIt's a very rare case, however it can happen with a shared storage environment using slow NFS.",
