VlanManager on single-host OpenStack can NOT work.\nThe test bed I use is as below.\n\nOpenStack release:     grizzly\nOS:                                    Cent OS 6.4\nType of network:          VlanManager (nova-network)\nHost condition:             single-host (NOT multi-host)\n\nI am trying to build VlanManager environment with OpenStack grizzly on Cent OS 6.4, but it doesn't work. VM creation failed.\nI am using all-in-one architecture (single-host). FlatDHCPManager successfully worked on the host.\n\nI am assuming that I came across a bug/defect that VlanManager can't work with single-host environment. \nI'd like OpenStack team to examine and determine if there is such a bug related to VlanManger on single-host environment.\n\nThank you very much in advance,\nBird Kafka",
