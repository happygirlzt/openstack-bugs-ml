The only reason the code is written in that way is because the author was trying to be clever :).\n\nAlso (based on your example), currently source=blank, destination=volume will not work. We should either make it create an empty volume and attach it, or disallow it in the API.\n\nI'm going to report a different bug for this so we can track it as well.",

Today, you can define a\n    bootable volume that is sourced from an image, volume, or\n    snapshot. However, you cannot define a volume that is sourced\n    from 'blank', even though it is one of the source options\n    available. For example, the following command will not work:\n    nova boot --flavor m1.tiny\n    --block-device source=blank,dest=volume,size=1,bootindex=0 test.\n    This is because the method used to identify ephemeral volumes\n    (new_format_is_ephemeral) believes any block device with\n    source_type=blank is an ephemeral, and there is no logic to\n    handle volumes where source_type=blank. The following patch\n    fixes these bugs by properly identifying ephemeral block\n    devices and creating blank/empty volumes when source_type=blank\n    and destination_type=volume.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5aa9684bfad1749fadff3018b13a225ed8f16fe8\n    Closes-Bug: #1347028\n    Closes-Bug: #1347499\n",
