    "description": "When attempting to resize an instance via the OpenStack API, the compute API receives a 'flavorid' instead of an instance_type id for the \"resize\" call. These values don't always line up correctly so resizes might not act as expected.\n\nWhen the OSAPI receives a resize call:\n\n1) Retrieve the instance_type ID using the given flavorid\n2) Call compute API with retrieved instance_type ID.",
