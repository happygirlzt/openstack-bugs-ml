    "description": "Some exceptions raised by _delete_instance() in nova-compute's manager cause terminate_instance() to leave the instance task as 'deleting'.  The task entry keeps nova-compute from noticing further power state transitions via _sync_power_states(), wedging the virtual machine in the 'deleting' state.\n\nThis bug affects the nova-compute manager module: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py\n\nBug 1177584 may be an example of this in action:\n\n\u00a0* terminate_instance() calls the baremetal driver to destroy an instance\n\u00a0* a slow system call in the baremetal driver.destroy() operation raises an InstancePowerOffFailure exception\n\u00a0* the exception bubbles back up to terminate_instance(), which ignores it\n\u00a0* the instance is left in power_state.RUNNING, vm_state.ACTIVE, task_state.DELETING\n\u00a0* _sync_power_states() ignores further power state changes because of the active task\n\nThis could happen with any virtual machine driver that raises an exception during a call to its driver.destroy() method.\n\nIt's worth noting that keeping the task as-is after exceptions in terminate_instance() was done on purpose to resolve bug 1046236 (see the terminate_instance() source for details).\n\nReproducing this bug is difficult: terminate_instance() handles some exceptions and not others, and the same applies to the try/except blocks in _delete_instance() and _shutdown_instance().   However, it is possible to reproduce this bug in a unit test that mocks out _shudown_instance() and raises an InstancePowerOffFailure.  A poisoned driver that injects an InstancePowerOffFailure would also work.\n\nReported against nova master: commit 8fb450fb3aa033d42c5dddb907392efd70f54a6b",
