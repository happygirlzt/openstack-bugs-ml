In notifications.send_update_with_states, one of the arguments is an Instance and if an attribute needs to be lazy-loaded, (example: tags, as part of the InstanceUpdatePayload) and the load method contains a _check_instance_exists_in_project call in the DB layer, InstanceNotFound is raised at that point because the context wasn't targeted to the instance's cell.\n\nWe need to target the context in case the notification call needs to load something from the instance's cell database.",

In this case, a lazy-load will happen and if the\n    load method needs to lookup the instance (example: in the\n    _check_instance_exists_in_project method in the DB layer), the\n    InstanceNotFound exception will be raised and the notification\n    will fail to be sent.\n    \n    This targets the instance context to the instance's cell when\n    calling the send notification method.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1721670\n    \n    Change-Id: I6b9eb120b6e7fcbf919a3791afe2d1f6a7bd3b60\n",
