When the snapshot is uploaded to glance, the source\n    image metadata is uploaded with the new snapshot and then some\n    of the metadata properties are updated. The update doesn't\n    include the disk_type property, this can be problematic. If\n    the original image has a sparse disk type and a snapshot is\n    taken, then the snapshot which is a preallocated disk type is\n    uploaded to glance with the disk_type property set to sparse,\n    which creates a disk type mismatch and causes errors when a vm\n    is spawned from that snapshot. This patch addresses the issue\n    by correcting the image metadata used when uploading a snapshot\n    to glance.\n    \n    Also, the image_upload function in vmwareapi/fake.py has been\n    modified to address the change. Any function call to\n    image_upload (from the unit tests) will assert that the\n    metadata for the image to be uploaded must have the disk_type\n    value to be preallocated.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1247296\n    Change-Id: I71cfa8d4d1eb7911abb489153292fb0d1e614765\n",
