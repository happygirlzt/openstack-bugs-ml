In order to still support deploying on this\n    hardware, let's increase the timeout from the default 300 seconds to 900\n    seconds to allow for this less performant gear. It is not recommended to\n    increase this past 900 as if we start hitting this then we need to be\n    understanding what is occuring in these db syncs. 300 seconds should be\n    enough time to setup a database especially on install. But there are\n    cases for upgrades or slower disks where it can exceed 300 seconds.\n    \n    Change-Id: I77507c638237072e38d9888aff3da884aeff0b59\n    Related-Bug: #1660722\n    Related-Bug: #1661396\n",
