Given that rxtx_factor is stored\n    as a float in the database this makes sense... and also adheres\n    to some of the extension documentation as well (although some of\n    the extension docs were incorrect as well).\n    \n    Previously rxtx_factor was being cast into an int which caused it to\n    be stored and displayed incorrectly via the API.\n    \n    This patchset adds a test which fails with the old code.\n    \n    Additionally some of the API docs are corrected so that rxtx_factor is\n    listed as a float in all examples.\n    \n    Fixes LP Bug #1081287.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae98522a1f2ed63cbd2497b0b0af5ac2d9bb935c\n",
