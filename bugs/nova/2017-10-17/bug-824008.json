When I run euca-terminate-instances, it doesn't seem like it should show up in euca-describe-instances anymore once it's shutdown and gone.\n\nThe reason I filed this as a bug is because it was working as desired (perhaps not as expected or to ec2 spec?). I would terminate an instance and it wouldn't show up in describe instances anymore. I upgraded the code and suddenly instances I'd terminated months ago were showing up again.\n\nSo, again, I guess I'm not really sure how to proceed because I don't think seeing every instance you've ever run every time you describe-instances is desired most of the time.",
