I wrote Ansible scripts to do that, and it turned out that they won't do it because of these:\n/var/lib/nova was a home directory for nova user and it had a selinux context nova_var_lib_t so I found in audit.log that it won't allow nova user to log in because of that.\nAnd I changed context to user_home_t while leaving other directories to their default one, which is nova_var_lib_t except .ssh that had to be ssh_home_t.\n\nEverything worked until I rebooted controller host (in this setup I have controller host that runs compute too, and two other compute nodes and Storwize as backend for Cinder). So I suppose that along the various tests and try/fail/success scenarios that I have been trying, I turned SELinux temporarily off by \"setenforce 0\" which returned back after reboot.\n\nToday I found in logs that nova-api complains about not being able to access /var/lib/nova/keys directory because of wrong context of /var/lib/nova so I returned it back from user_home_t to nova_var_lib_t and set Ansible scripts to do the same, to generate and exchange ssh keys and to return context of nova's home and I don't get those stuck instances, so I suppose that it was the reason why I got those crashes of nova client when I tried to delete some of stuck instances.\n\n",
