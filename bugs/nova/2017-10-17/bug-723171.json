            "content": "Sure ;) I forgot this report.\n\nIMO the definition of the method \"service_get_all\" is wrong, because all other methods named \"FOO_get_all\" will return all the objects and not only a subset (calling the methods without arguments). For example you call \"floating_ip_get_all\" and you will get all floating ips. But if you call  \"service_get_all()\" you will only receive all enable services.\n\nFor the receiving of subsets of objects there are special methods \"service_get_by_FOO\" and \"service_get_all_FOO\". All other \"FOO_get_all\" only have the context parameter.\n\nSo I think the method \"service_get_all\" isn't conform to the other \"FOO_get_all\" methods and I don't like that inconsistence. You know the \"broken windows theory\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory?",
