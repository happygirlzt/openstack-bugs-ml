    "description": "Based on the OpenStack documentation at http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/ChangesSince.html...\"To allow clients to keep track of changes, the changes-since filter displays items that have been recently deleted. Both images and servers contain a DELETED status that indicates that the resource has been removed.\"  This allows OpenStack consumers to determine when images and servers are deleted when using the changes-since support.  OpenStack works as documented for images.  However, changes-since support in OpenStack Havana may not return deleted servers with a DELETED status.\n\nThe recreate scenario is as follows:\n1) Boot a new server and wait for the boot to complete.\n2) Save the current time \n3) Use changes-since to get all servers changed since the time saved in step 2.  It should be none.\n4) Delete the server created in step 1 and wait for the delete to complete.\n5) Use changes-since to get all servers changed since the time saved in step 2.  It should include the server deleted in step 4 and the server's status should be DELETED.  The actual result is that the server is included but its status is ERROR.\n\nFor the above recreate scenario, the boot failed because no valid host was found.  As a result, the server is in ERROR status after step 1.  I have not tested with a successful boot.",
