    "description": "When attaching an iSCSI volume, Nova triggers a HBA scan in order to\nfind the static targets and indirectly populate the SCSI topology in\nvCenter.\nThe current implementation takes the first host found as the host to\nperform the scan. This doesn't take into account the fact that the VM\ncan run on another host. This is problematic because then the host\nwhere the VM is running is not aware of the target that the VM is\nsupposed to be attached to.\n\nSee: http://<email address hidden>/msg25648.html for more details",
