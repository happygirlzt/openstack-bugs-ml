    "description": "There is no consistent validation for the 'name' parameter across compute resources. The following characters need to be validated in the input:\n\n1. One more whitespaces (like ' ' or '    ') -\n2. Leading or trailing whitespaces (like '   test123 ')\n\nCurrently flavor name, volume name, role name, group name, security group name and keypair name accept input in each of the two cases (no validation).\n\nAdding the two cases above to name parameter validation would be useful.\nIt makes sense to move this validation code to a common utility that can be used across all Create resource methods.\nAlthough the 'name' is not as significant the resource's ID, it does act as a label for the resource and should be validated properly.\n\nFor example, from the dasbhboard, a role with a blank name, i.e single whitespace string like ' ' can be created. This get's stored in the keystone db as NULL and appears in the dashboard roles drop down during Create User as None. This behavior should be fixed. \n\nRefer: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L3086 _validate_new_keypair() can be moved to a common utility to provide 'name' field validations.",
