This is not true and therefore _destroy_evacuated_instances fails\n    with an exception and does not clean up the evacuated instance.\n    \n    The solution for the original bug included a functional regression\n    test. However the functional test env is not capable of fully simulate\n    a nova-compute service restart. The service only stopped then started\n    again. This allows some in memory state of the compute service to\n    survive the simulated restart. This caused that the functional test\n    was not able to catch that the above described assumption is not\n    correct.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1721652\n    Related-Bug: #1709902\n    Change-Id: Icaf1bae8cb040b939f916a19ce026031ddb84af7\n",
