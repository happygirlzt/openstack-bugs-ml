    "description": "I'm on stable/mitaka, but the master code looks similar.\n\nI have compute nodes configured to use qcow2 and libvirt.  The flavor has an ephemeral disk and a swap disk, with root disk size of \"0\" for auto-size.  I boot an instance with this flavor.\n\nWhen I try to cold-migrate the instance, I get an error:\n2016-07-21 23:33:48.561 46340 ERROR nova.compute.manager [instance: 4e52bfd8-0c71-48dc-89fb-6f6b31dc06bb] libvirtError: Cannot access backing file '/etc/nova/instances/_base/ephemeral_1_0706d66' of storage file '/etc/nova/instances/4e52bfd8-0c71-48dc-89fb-6f6b31dc06bb/disk.eph0' (as uid:0, gid:0): No such file or directory\n\nThe problem seems to be that in nova.virt.libvirt.driver.LibvirtDriver.finish_migration() we call self._create_image(...block_device_info=None...)\n\nDown in _create_image() we handle the case of a \"disk.local\" ephemeral device, but that doesn't help because the device is actually named \"disk.eph0\".   It looks like we then try to loop over any ephemerals in block_device_info, but that's None so we don't handle any of those (which is too bad since it looks like they would be named correctly).\n\nThe end result is that we have a qcow2 \"disk.eph0\" image, but with potentially no backing store in <instances_path>/_base.  When we tell libvirt to start the instance, this results in the above error.",

I guess such implementation may work in Mitaka (i mostly mean usage of @mock.patch.object(nova.virt.libvirt.imagebackend.Backend, 'image') instead ImageBackendFixture). So you might rewrite tests to use it, but i have no idea if the result will be accepted as the backport to Mitaka.\n\nI know nothing about package rules. I thought that a package must exactly contain a tagged version of an OS project source code, but recently i found an exception of this rule...",
