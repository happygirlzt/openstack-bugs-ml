In addition to this, the possible workaround in Horizon are:\n\n(1) Before/Inside calling server_create called from handle() in create_instance workflow class, if security_group ID is an integer (nova-network is used),  to retrieve name according to its ID and pass security group name as a parameter of server_create()\n\n(2) Similar to (1), to encode sg.id and sg.name with json in populate_groups_choices in project/instances/workflows/create_instance.py, and use sg.name when sg.id is an integer not UUID. This saves additional security_group_list API call.\n\n(3) Use security_group name as security group ID if ID is an integer in api/nova. It can be done in api/nova SecurityGroup class.\n\nAll of the above options look  workarounds to me, but it can help us.\n\nI would like to know your opinions.",
