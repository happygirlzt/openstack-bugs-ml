None of the other OS API's handle update this way.  It seems alright to check to make sure no extra attributes are specified (since the extension can remove the ones it handles), but these 3 lines need to be removes or commented out:\n      #if status is None and maint_mode is None:\n      #     explanation = _(\"'status' or 'maintenance_mode' needed for host update\")\n      #     raise webob.exc.HTTPBadRequest(explanation=explanation)",
