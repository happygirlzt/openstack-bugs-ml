    "description": "When using an older microversion (2.25 or earlier) with boot-from-image, and the user forgets to specify block-migration, the error message returned is this:\n\n\"Live migration can not be used without shared storage except a booted from volume VM which does not have a local disk.\"\n\nThis has a couple things wrong with it. First, the triple-negative is a bit confusing, especially for non-native-english speakers.  Second, it implies that you cannot do a block migration, which is obviously false.\n\nI think a more clear error message would be something like:\n\n\"Shared storage migration requires either shared storage or boot-from-volume with no local disks.\"",
