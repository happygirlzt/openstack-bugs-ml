    "description": "As demonstrated in Nova API ref:\nhttp://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-compute-v2.1.html#servers-v2.1\nuser should encode their injected file content with base64 encoding  before use it.\nBut yet we are lack of validation of whether it is correctely encoded,\nand it will pass down to nova/compute/manager for decoding [1]. If the provided content failed to decode, Base64DecodeError will raise but yet\nnot handled, this will also cause the async problem of scheduler and\ncompute.\n\nWe should add validate this first in the API layer since in this way we can\nsave the cost for performing the rest of booting jobs such as scheduling etc.\n\n[1] http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/compute/manager.py#n1910",
