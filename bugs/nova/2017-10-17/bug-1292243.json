We now loop\n    through all of the ports and attempt the delete.\n    \n    In the allocate flow we don't raise any errors\n    since the instance is set to ERROR anyway and\n    we're just trying to cleanup.\n    \n    In the deallocate flow we attempt to delete all\n    of the ports and if there was a non-404 exception\n    we raise that at the end so the overall instance\n    delete operation fails.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf68e0b4770b09ee32f187b85f2ca96984117e0b\n    Closes-bug: #1292243\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Sean Dague <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Matt Riedemann <email address hidden>\n",
