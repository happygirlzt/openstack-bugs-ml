The mocks aren't referenced later. However they\n    are listed in the wrong order. While this doesn't impact this test\n    directly, it is confusing, and may confuse people down the road trying\n    to build tests based on this one.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idd1da91fe8d8b1e20bef469ef67728610a9ac3c1\n    Closes-Bug: #1527881\n",
