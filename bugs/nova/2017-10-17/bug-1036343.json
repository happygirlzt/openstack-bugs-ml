Looking at the class \"Requestify\" in ../nova/api/ec2/__init__.py There are several potential issues:\n\n1. Only Timestamp is tested for, but Expires isn't.\n2. The format of the Timestamp is not tested for.\n3. The value of the Timestamp is not tested to be within some time delta.\n\nThe AWS documentation states at this link\n\n    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/Query-Common-Parameters.html\n\n\"Requests must include either Timestamp or Expires, but cannot contain both\" and \"The date and time at which the request is signed, in the format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ\" which addresses points 1 and 2 above.\n\nThe AWS documentation at this link and others\n\n    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Error_Messages.html\n\nstates,\n\n\"Why do I get keep getting \"Request has expired\" errors?\n\nTo reduce the risk of replay attacks, our requests include a timestamp. This and the most important parts of the request are signed to ensure the message (including the timestamp) cannot be modified without detection.\n\nIf the difference between the timestamp in the request and the time on our servers is larger than 5 minutes, the request is too old (or too new) and an error is returned.\n\nYou need to ensure that your system clock is accurate and configured to use the correct time zone. For more information, go to NTP.\"\n\nLooking at the code in Requestify and searching the rest of the code base for use of \"Timestamp\" I don't any places where Timestamp is used or tested. It seems like this is a potential security related issue.",
