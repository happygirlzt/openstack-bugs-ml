    "description": "When nova-vmware is used as compute with NSX-mh neutron plugin, network type for launch OpenStack instance is being set to opaque, but that is not valid network type for the NSX vswitch. It should be nsx.network. As a result, instance is launched and remains disconnected.\n\nIf trying to create an NSX vswitch on ESXi, it shows opaque as invalid.\n\n~ #  nsxcli network/add br-int2 br-int2 opaque manual\nInvalid opaque network type\nValid types are nsx.network and nsx-bridge.network\nnsx-appctl: nsxd: server returned an error\n~ #\n\nThis applies to both ESXi 5.5 and 6.0",
