Because I'm using SLES11 and they're using other files and an other format to configure there networks I want to have the option to 1) specify the usage template file and 2) to specify the destination file in the image. I suggest using two new flags (--inject_net_file_template, --inject_net_file_destination) and to place the temlate file per default in /etc/nova/ and not in /usr/lib.../site-packages/nova/virt/.",
