This url endpoint needs to be configured in nova.conf\n\nBut, currently, each group/section (Placement, Neutron, keystoneauth etc.) has same configuration field. They all uses same endpoint which represents value of this config field.\n\nWe can move this configuration to defaults section, so that we don't have to configure same config value in multiple groups.",
