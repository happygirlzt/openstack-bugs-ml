From this point on, the BDM is canonical.\n\nHowever, a user may also specify BDMs explicitly at creation time, which means that the user may:\n\n* Specify an ephemeral disk smaller than flavor.ephemeral_gb\n* Specify multiple ephemeral disks whose total size is <= flavor.ephemeral_gb\n\nIn both of these cases, it is not at all clear what the behaviour on resize should be. In practise, the only safe thing would be to leave them alone. As there is no api to explicitly resize an ephemeral disk, and it's not clear that it's worth creating one, I don't see that there is any solution to the general case.\n\nIt is possible that we could check if there is a single, full size ephemeral disk and resize only in that case, possibly emitting a warning otherwise.",
