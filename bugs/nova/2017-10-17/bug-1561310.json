I'm currently working to reproduce your issue, but I need more information:\n\n1) Can you provide more detail as to how you got to your current state? It sounds like you have 8 instances, is that correct? Have you recently deleted any instances or launched any instances that failed?\n\n2) What version of Nova are you running? (Kilo, Liberty, Mitaka, current master, etc)\n\n3) What happens when you launch an instance using the command line client? Do you also get the quota error in that case?\n",

Not sure whether any instances have been deleted that failed, because there are too many users belongs to this project. But I saw a \"rebuild\" task is running in the dashboard, maybe the\none instance is being rebuild, so the 'reserved' column is set to a none zero value.\n2)The environment is installed by others people, I check some code in this release, it seems the icehouse release.(2014.1) \nOr do you have any method/command to ensure the version?\n3)I launch the instance using command and got following logs:\nOverLimit: Quota exceeded for instances: Requested 1, but already used 10 of 10 instances (HTTP 413) (Request-ID: req-c2e1f366-ed73-4050-8523-5d524733b3c9)\nERROR: Quota exceeded for instances: Requested 1, but already used 10 of 10 instances (HTTP 413) (Request-ID: req-c2e1f366-ed73-4050-8523-5d524733b3c9)\n\nNot sure whether the info above will help, but I have a workaround to re-produce this bug:\nFor example, if your total quotas of instances is 10, and 8/10 used, you can do this:\nmysql;\nuse nova;\nUPDATE `quota_usages` SET `reserved`=2 WHERE  `project_id`='827fb1414de740569efd53580bafc2f0' and `resource`='instances' LIMIT 1;\nThen, refresh your dashboard in the web browser, you will get this bug.",

If that adds up to 10 when you recreate, then I think the bug is in Horizon for not using the --reserved option when displaying quota usage.",
