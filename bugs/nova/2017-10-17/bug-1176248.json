It is because ebtables rules are blocking arp traffic made by the dnsmasq gateway IP.\r\n\r\nWhat is the real reason behind putting those ebtables rules? What we have found that when we dropped the rules (manually),\r\nthe communication seems to go through. So want to understand what is the purpose of those rules.\r\n\r\nThanks Again!\r\n\r\n",
