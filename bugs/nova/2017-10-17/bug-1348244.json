Now the messages for debug logs are not translated by _() but, when oslo logging is used (log.py) the intention was that as part of the process() method on the ContextAdapter class (which is a LoggerAdapter returned from oslo's getLogger method) it would ensure that the log messages were unicode.  In particular the check is:\n\n        if not isinstance(msg, six.string_types):\n            msg = six.text_type(msg)\n\nUnfortunately the isinstance() is checking if it is an instance of six.string_types (i.e. checking if it is a str in PY3 or a basestring in PY2).  This means that the cast to six.text_type (unicode) is only happening when the message does not need it.  Instead the check should be if it is an instance of six.text_type so that when it isn't, the cast is done.:\n\n        if not isinstance(msg, six.text_type):\n            msg = six.text_type(msg)\n",
