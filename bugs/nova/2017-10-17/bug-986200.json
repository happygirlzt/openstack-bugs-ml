This API is invoked by the\n    'nova diagnostic' command.\n    \n    There is no existing formal specification for what data items\n    to expose from the 'get_diagnostics' API, so the XenAPI driver\n    is used as an informal guide. The Xen implementation currently\n    produces the following output:\n    \n    +----------------+-----------------+\n    |    Property    |      Value      |\n    +----------------+-----------------+\n    | cpu0           | 4.3627          |\n    | memory         | 1171088064.0000 |\n    | memory_target  | 1171088064.0000 |\n    | vbd_xvda_read  | 0.0             |\n    | vbd_xvda_write | 0.0             |\n    | vif_0_rx       | 3223.6870       |\n    | vif_0_tx       | 0.0             |\n    | vif_1_rx       | 104.4955        |\n    | vif_1_tx       | 0.0             |\n    +----------------+-----------------+\n    \n    The new libvirt implementation will return a similar set of stats\n    for guest CPUs, memory, disks and network interfaces, resulting\n    in the following output:\n    \n    +------------------+------------+\n    | Property         | Value      |\n    +------------------+------------+\n    | cpu0_time        | 2870000000 |\n    | memory           | 524288     |\n    | vda_errors       | -1         |\n    | vda_read         | 262144     |\n    | vda_read_req     | 112        |\n    | vda_write        | 5606400    |\n    | vda_write_req    | 376        |\n    | vnet0_rx         | 63343      |\n    | vnet0_rx_drop    | 0          |\n    | vnet0_rx_errors  | 0          |\n    | vnet0_rx_packets | 431        |\n    | vnet0_tx         | 4905       |\n    | vnet0_tx_drop    | 0          |\n    | vnet0_tx_errors  | 0          |\n    | vnet0_tx_packets | 45         |\n    +------------------+------------+\n    \n    The implementation has only been tested with the libvirt KVM\n    driver.\n    \n    In a future a formal specification for the required data\n    format should be written and all virt drivers made to comply.\n    \n    Finally, the fakelibvirt driver has been updated in order to\n    support the methods required by the get_diagnostics method.\n    \n    For those interested, below is the formula to extract the\n    CPU usage based on the CPU time. I've added it here for reference\n    since it's not used at the moment and it took quite a while\n    to locate it in the libvirt documentation.\n    \n      usage = 100 * (current_cpu_time - last_cpu_time) /\n              (measurement_interval * (10 ** 9))\n    \n    Fixes bug 986200.\n    Change-Id: I92da392f43d0840ed31cfd88f54570ea5830bb4a\n",
