These firewalls are attached to switches which also support\n802.1q, and then of course we use tag interfaces on the compute nodes\n(which double as network nodes, for availability), and we pre-configure\ntenants with a subnet (say, a /24), a vlan tag (say, vlan 4), and various\nfirewall policies (and perhaps also gateway-to-gateway IPSec VPN\nconfigurations). Then, cloud instances are configured to use these hardware\nfirewalls as their default gateway (let's say, 172.27.4.1/24) using the\ndnsmasq patch. In some cases, the tenant may also have physical dedicated\nsystems on the same subnet (vlan 4), and use the openstack instances to\nprovide dynamic scaling for certain parts of their workload, while using\nthe dedicated physical hardware for other purposes (highly available\ndatabase servers for instance, which for security couldn't be on a shared\narchitecture, or for various other reasons).\n\nThis, when instances are started, they all use 172.27.4.1 as a default\ngateway, and the nova-network is configured to tag all traffic.\n\nThere are some interesting SDN (software defined networking) features that\nwe want to use with Quantum, but they are (or at least seem) mutually\nexclusive with our current (unchangeable) setup.\n\nAny public IP addressing is done through our hardware firewall stack, and\nis one-to-one NAT mapping generally speaking. The firewalls also serve as\nIPS/IDS, and VPN gateways, this they are needed.\n\nDoes this explanation help?\n\nMichael\n\n\nOn Sun, Apr 7, 2013 at 5:51 AM, Salvatore Orlando <\n<email address hidden>> wrote:\n\n> Hi, for Quantum support, are you just referring to the fix on gerrit for\n> this bug?\n> If yes, this should not affect quantum:\n> https://github.com/openstack/quantum/blob/master/quantum/agent/linux/dhcp.py#L271\n>\n> If instead your question is about external gateways, Quantum has a concept\n> of 'external network' which can be used to allocate gateways for routers\n> and floating IPs.
