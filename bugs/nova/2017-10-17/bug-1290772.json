After the first call, the keys related to this\n    topic in redis reads like this:\n      \"topic\": set([\"topic.host\"])\n      \"topic.host\": \"\"\n    \n    If the second call, it tries to add the following keys:\n      \"topic.host\": set([\"topic.host.host\"])\n      \"topic.host.host\": \"\"\n    \n    But the key \"topic.host\" already exists as a string type.\n    So the error occurs.\n    \n    To resolve this problem, change the value of keys from string\n    to set.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic801393d492d2656fcfd8b87f1d2efc6ab3bbd62\n    Closes-Bug: #1290772\n",
