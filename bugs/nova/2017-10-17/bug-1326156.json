    "description": "When using xenserver as a hypervisor while using fastcopy functionality,  if the base copy + vhd tree exceeds the flavors disk limit the build will fail.  By default we have 10 gb of overhead added by Teran a long time ago.   I took Terans patch and made it configurable in nova.conf as some openstack users need this value to be larger based on their flavor specs and base image size.\n\nSuggested fix : https://review.openstack.org/#/c/94501",
