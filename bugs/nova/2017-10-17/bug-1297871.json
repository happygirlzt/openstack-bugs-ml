People seems to agree with having consistent values for all size parameters, but we didn't decide whether use MB for everything, or GB with fractial sizes etc... As it was modifying the Nova Driver and is just a medium/low priority bug getting it fix in Juno was a bit more complicated due the Driver Freeze, but I will tackle it once Kilo opens.",
