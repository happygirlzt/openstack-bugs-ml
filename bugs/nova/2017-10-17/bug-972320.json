We should not force people to edit the DB by hand. Of course, this should never happen, but a common cause is miss-configuration of the system.\n\nIt would also be good to find out when a hypervisor appears to be out of sync with the database and allow an admin to go and solve that issue, rather than having to search around the logs and check the actual hypervisor. Perhaps use the notification system to notify there is a problem on the hypervisor.",
