(At least, I disagree changing the default name as neutron-core if it is proposed.)\nWe can replace \"default\" to other name when displaying security group in Horizon layer, but we also need to consider the consistency between API and Horizon. I am afraid that different names between API and Horizon may cause another confusion to users. Thought?",
