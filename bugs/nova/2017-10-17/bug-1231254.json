    "description": "(This bug report is forked off from 1026621).\n\nI'm sorry to hear you're having pain with Windows instances.\nUnfortunately I don't know a lot about windows, but it sounds as though\nif we could change the bios timezone for Windows instances to the\ntimezone of the compute node that would alleviate your issue. Is that\ncorrect?\n\nLooking at the code, each instance has an os_type field, which is\ninherited from the image the instance is based off (there is an image\nproperty called os_type). Xen expects this value to be \"windows\" for\nwindows instances. So, libvirt could do the same thing here and treat\nthe timezone for instances with os_type == \"windows\" differently.\n\nI'm going to create a new bug to track this windows issue, so that I\ncan leave this bug focussed on the DHCP timeout issue. This isn't\nbecause Windows is less important as a guest, but because I don't want\nit to be missed in the DHCP discussion that's happening here.",
