The consumer of this kind of information,\n    like scheduler or 'os-service' API extension, will consider a service\n    is 'up' (active) if last update from that service is not longer than\n    'service_down_time' ago.\n    \n    The problem is if 'report_interval' was configured/provided greater\n    than 'service_down_time' by mistake, services would then be always\n    considered in 'down' state, which can result in unsuccesful placement\n    of volume create request for example.  This is what Bug #1255685 is\n    about.\n    \n    In previous fix: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60760/, a\n    configuration check helper function basic_config_check() was added\n    *wrongly* to WSGIService class instead of Service class.  This patch\n    moves the configuration check helper function and the check to the\n    right place to make sure 'report_interval' is less then\n    'service_down_time'.\n    \n    Closes-bug #1255685\n    \n    Change-Id: I14bd8c54e5ce20719844f437808ad98a011820de\n",
