Please treat the\nfollowing information as confidential until the proposed public\ndisclosure date.\n\nTitle: DoS by allocating all Fixed IPs\nImpact: Medium\nReporter: Vish Ishaya (Nebula)\nProducts: Nova\nAffects: All versions\n\nDescription:\nVish Ishaya reported a vulnerability in Nova where there is no quota\nfor Fixed IPs. Previously the instance quota acted as a proxy for\na Fixed IP quota, but if your configuration allows an instance to\nconsume more than one Fixed IP via an extension such as multinic\nthen this is no longer true. Running out of Fixed IPs would result in\nnot being able to spawn new instances.\n\nProposed patches:\nSee attached patches. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these\npatches will be merged to Nova master (Grizzly), stable/folsom,\nand stable/essex branches on the public disclosure date.\n\nCVE:\nNo CVE has been assigned to this issue yet.\n\nProposed public disclosure date/time:\nTuesday, March 12, 1500UTC\nPlease do not make the issue public (or release public patches) before\nthis coordinated embargo date.\n\nRegards,\n\n-----\n\nIf we're running with that disclosure date we should probably send this out ASAP.
