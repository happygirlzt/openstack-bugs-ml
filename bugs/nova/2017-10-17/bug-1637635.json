We don't have a spec for adding notifications for CRUD operations on security groups, but we probably won't anyway since nova-network is deprecated and going away, so any CRUD operations on security groups in nova are just proxies to neutron, and we've deprecated those APIs in the 2.36 microversion. So this is invalid, and searchlight should get those notifications from neutron.",
