    "description": "The periodic task which looks for instances which have been deleted in the DB but are still running at the hypervisor supports a \"reap\" action to delete them.  It does this by calling the _shutdown_instance() method, which as part of its processing will send notification messages.\n\nHowever, the notification code depends on the instance object including system metadata information, and the db queries that build instance objects do not extend the \"read deleted\" filter down to these queries.   This results in an exception in the shutdown code, which in turn prevents the  VM from being deleted.\n\n\nFeels like there are three issues here:\n\ni) The reap code should not send notification messages.  The instance was deleted some time ago, and so messages will have been generated then.  Also there will have been no \"exists\"  messages for this instance.  Sending new messages for the instance at this point will confuse any billing systems looking for such messages.\n\nii) The notification code should be more robust and use get() methods when reading data from the instance object\n\niii) The DB queries for building an instance should carry the \"read deleted\" filter into all sub queries for consistency.\n\n\nThis bug relates to just the first of these - other bugs will be filed for the other two points.",
