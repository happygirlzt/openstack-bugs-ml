    "description": "The rpc api build_and_run_instance should be back-compatible with icehouse, as the code https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/rpcapi.py#L887\n\nIt turn the request_network object into tuple that can be understand by icehouse code.\n\nBut the commit a8a5d44c8aca218f00649232c2b8a46aee59b77e change the request_network parameter. It add pci_request_id for each item. When request_network object turn it to tuple, it will add pci_request_id into\ntuple also, that make each tuple have four items. https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/objects/network_request.py#L37\n\nOld code only accept three items for each tuple: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2014.1/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L237\n\nThen the rpc api back-compatiblity is broken.\n\nThen juno controller boot instance to icehouse compute node, will get error as below:\n2014-10-04 21:08:17.455 ERROR nova.compute.manager [req-58b84295-ce36-479f-b50e-dfe4f86cc1d9 admin demo] [instance: c643eff5-ffd0-4eea-98a0-bce55108b0a4] Insta\nnce failed to

But the icehouse code\n    assume only three items in the tuple.\n    \n    This patch filters pci_request_id out from the tuple.\n    \n    Cherry-Pick from:\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/126144/6\n    \n    Change-Id: I991e1c68324fe92fac647583f3ec8f6aec637913\n    Closes-Bug: #1377447\n\ncommit 10a5eecd0973096b57efd31f8b27d7295a44ab89\nAuthor: Andreas Jaeger <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Oct 9 12:22:36 2014 +0200\n\n    Updated translations\n    \n    Commands run:-\n    $ python setup.py extract_messages\n    $ python setup.py update_catalog --no-fuzzy-matching \\\n      --ignore-obsolete=true\n    $ source \\\n      ../openstack-infra/project-config/jenkins/scripts/common_translation_update.sh\n    $ setup_loglevel_vars\n    $ cleanup_po_file nova\n    \n    Change-Id: I64b2b468f7edd44dbb445b5b4e68b65c3fa53d9e\n\ncommit 3f9003270efd9ac036f3c229b36baa0bb05203bf\nAuthor: Russell Bryant <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 8 12:14:31 2014 +0000\n\n    Fix broken cert revocation\n    \n    Cert revocation was broken by\n    32b0adb591f80ad2c5c19519b4ffc2b55dbea672.  os.chdir() never returns\n    anything, so this method would always raise an exception.  The proper\n    way to handle an error from os.chdir() is to catch OSError.\n    \n    There were existing tests for this code, but they conveniently mocked\n    os.chdir() to return values that are never actually returned.  The\n    tests were fixed to match the real behavior.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7549bb60a7d43d53d6f81eecea31cbb9720cc8b6\n    Closes-bug: #1376368\n    (cherry picked from commit c8538208da00c3b0d0646629c9d668aa69944b85)\n\ncommit 6ed57972093835f449ad645b3783bbb8b3c4245e\nAuthor: Russell Bryant <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Oct 3 16:41:03 2014 -0400\n\n    Update rpc version aliases for juno\n    \n    Update all of the rpc client API classes to include a version alias\n    for the latest version implemented in Juno.  This alias is needed when\n    doing rolling upgrades from Juno to Kilo.  With this in place, you can\n    ensure all services only send messages that both Juno and Kilo will\n    understand.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1378786\n    Change-Id: Ia81538130bf8530b70b5f55c7a3d565903ff54b4\n    (cherry picked from commit f98d725103c53e767a1cddb0b7e2c3822309db17)\n\ncommit ee3594072a7ef1c3f5661021fb31118069cbd646\nAuthor: Tristan Cacqueray <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Oct 3 19:53:42 2014 +0000\n\n    Mask passwords in exceptions and error messages\n    \n    When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.ssh_execute(),\n    the exception may contain information such as password. Upstream\n    applications that just log the message (as several appear to do)\n    could inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to\n    the log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke\n    strutils.mask_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the\n    exception. A test case has been added (to oslo-incubator) in order to\n    ensure that all three are properly masked.\n    \n    An earlier commit (853d8f9897f8563851441108a9be26b10908c076) failed\n    to address ssh_execute(). This change set addresses ssh_execute.\n    \n    OSSA is aware of this change request.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie0caf32469126dd9feb44867adf27acb6e383958\n    Closes-Bug: #1377981\n\ncommit f98c28228b6db5b0796e9669b6bd692b82bbfa6d\nAuthor: liyingjun <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sat Sep 6 18:41:51 2014 +0800\n\n    Fix KeyError for euca-describe-images\n    \n    EC2 describe images crashes on volume backed instance snapshot which has\n    several volumes.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibe278688b118db01c9c3ae1763954adf19c7ee0d\n    Closes-bug: #1370265\n    (cherry picked from commit 1dea1cd710d54d4a2a584590e4ccf59dd3a41faa)\n\ncommit 0aeffa12a62604ee3238323d969345e41937b642\nAuthor: Vishvananda Ishaya <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 1 07:43:19 2014 -0700\n\n    Fix the os_networks display to show cidr properly\n    \n    Converting network_get and network_get_all to use objects broke\n    the display of the os_networks extension, because IPAddress\n    fields in Network objects are dumped as lists by the jsonutils\n    extension. We therefore must explicitly convert these object\n    field values to string.\n    \n    The tests are updated to use objects so that we pick up bugs\n    like this in the future. Incorrect assertEqual parameter order\n    is fixed in the tests too since these are comparing dicts and\n    it's not fun debugging a MismatchError when the reference/actual\n    values are backwards.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0f05a9b4d7bbe5fe0a3b110c191455ca7edefcb5\n    Closes-Bug: #1376945\n    Co-authored-by: Matt Riedemann <email address hidden>\n    (cherry picked from commit da25467aafce9b62dd3fdff9d6cd84121fbee17e)\n\ncommit 0251b53966eaa9e724377a300ea247367fd778c7\nAuthor: Matt Riedemann <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Oct 5 05:56:35 2014 -0700\n\n    Disable libvirt NUMA topology support if libvirt < 1.0.4\n    \n    If you're not at a new enough version of libvirt, the compute service\n    fails on startup because VirtNUMATopologyCellUsage is not fully\n    populated.\n    \n    This add a min version check before trying to get host NUMA topology\n    information.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1376307\n    \n    Change-Id: I00f6325cb554bc5e34d9f0fe651af39630f35b5d\n    (cherry picked from commit 8ba0d9188d492028fcf4e65f908aa2d3db571952)\n\ncommit 5065aeca1b4acad513c07e3832ec0e12de2e6568\nAuthor: Arnaud Legendre <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 1 15:46:22 2014 -0700\n\n    Destroy orig VM during resize if triggered by user\n    \n    Patch I7598afbf0dc3c527471af34224003d28e64daaff introduces a\n    Minesweeper failure, due to the fact that it doesn't distinguish\n    between destroy operation triggered by the user and by the revert\n    resize.\n    \n    This patch fixes the issue by checking the task state.

In python 2.x HTTPSConnection\n    doesn't care about SSL certs at all.
