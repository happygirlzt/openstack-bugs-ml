But notice that you change the security group but cannot remove a security group from an instance. The only thing you can do is terminate all the instances and then delete the security group. I think we should still put in the check for instances upon deletion and raise an exception.",

The EC2 documentation says that a\n    group that is still in use can not be removed.\n    \n    A new function has been added to the db API to find out whether a\n    particular security group is still in use.  \"In use\" is defined as\n    applied to an active instance, or applied to another group that has not\n    been deleted.\n    \n    Unit tests have been updated to ensure that an error is raised when\n    these conditions are hit.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5b3fdf1da213b04084fe266c1a6ed92e01cf1e19\n",
