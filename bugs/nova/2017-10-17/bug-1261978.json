In some cases the operator may want to use a non-default machine type. For example, with ARM by default the machine type is integratorcp, but users need to use the virt model or others such as vexpress-a15 with KVM",

On ARM systems\n    that results in a default type which will fail. This change provides two ways\n    to have Nova specify a machine type in the libvirt configuration:\n    \n    1) The image can be tagged with the property \"hw_machine_type=<type>\"\n    2) If Nova detects an armv7 or aarch64 processor it will use vexpress-a15 or\n       virt machine types respectively (this can be overridden with an image\n       property)\n    \n    Change-Id: I8aadfcf50e35a1370783ea795f80b29c1a71abff\n    Closes-Bug: #1261978\n    DocImpact\n",
