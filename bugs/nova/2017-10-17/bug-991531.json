Keystone shouldn't allow you to do this really IMO.\n\nWe still use this patch though as it means people using the ec2 api to upload bundles get the data into their own account in swift rather than a nova account where we can't enforce quotas etc. (although quite possibly this is fixed now that glance has quotas)\n\nI'm happy for this to be dropped as it doesn't look like anyone else finds this useful.\n\n\n\n",
