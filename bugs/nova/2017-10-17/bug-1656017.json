If map_cell0 is used as a standalone command it always returns a non-0 exit code because it's returning a CellMapping object (or failing with a duplicate entry error if the cell0 mapping already exists).\n\nWe should split the main part of the map_cell0 function out into a private method and then treat map_cell0 as a normal CLI with integer exit codes (0 on success, >0 on failure) and print out whatever information is needed when mapping cell0, like the uuid for example.",
