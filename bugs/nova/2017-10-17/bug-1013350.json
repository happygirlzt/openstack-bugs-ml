    "description": "When nova compute throws an exception while trying to create a vm instance, information about the exception is put into the \"instance_faults\" database table. That table has a message column.  That column is getting filled in with the exception class name and not with the exception message.\n\nHere is a little more detail of what I am trying to do:\n\nI want to have my application that is using OpenStack to be able to show the root cause of why OpenStack could not create a vm.  I do a \"nova boot ...\" call to create a vm instance.  If that fails to get created properly I want to display the reason back to the user.  I was expecting that I would be able to get a message with the cause when I did a \"nova show vm-name\" call.  That call contains fault information.  Without this bug fix I get information like this:\n| fault | {u'message': u'RemoteError', u'code': 500, u'created': u'2012-05-11T20:19:41Z'}\n\nThe 'RemoteError' is the class name of the exception that was thrown.\n\nInstead I would like to get an error line like this:\n| fault | {u'message': u'Zero floating ips available.', u'code': 500, u'created': u'2012-05-11T20:19:41Z'}\n\nThe \"Zero floating ips available\" is the message that the RemoteError exception contains.\n\nThe instance_faults table has a code, message, and details columns (along with some others).  For the case I have they get filled in like this:\nmessage: RemoteError \ncode: 500\ndetails: RemoteError: Zero floating ips available   followed by the full stack trace\n\nI don't want to have to parse out the message from the stack trace, so the details field will not help me.  I am hoping that OpenStack can change the message field in the database to be one of two things:\n1. the exception message only.  For example: \"Zero floating ips available\"\n2 the class name followed by the exception message.  For example: \"RemoteError: Zero floating ips available\"\n\nWith one of those changes I will be able to get the error message that explains why the vm was not created with the REST call that does the equivalent of the  \"nova show vm-name\" command and show the message  to the user so they will know what went wrong.\n\nI have attached a patch file that shows the change in the nova/compute/manager.py file for option 1",
