It took some time to me, to find out why the changes won't be applied.\n\nMaybe we can add another flag e.g. \"--debug_libvirt_template=[true/false]\" ? When true, compute should read the libvirt template each time an instance is created. When false (default) it should be read only once. \n\nIf this is interesting to you, I would spend time to learn some python and create the neccessary changes. But this does only make sense if I am not the only person with this use case.",
