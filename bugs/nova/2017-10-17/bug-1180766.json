    "description": "Currently, fix_ip disassociation only happens in release_fixed_ip(), which is called by dhcp-bridge when ip is released. But there are circumstances when instancs fail to get lease from dnsmasq(instances fail to boot or instances fail to spawn). In such case, DHCPRELEASE packet sent to dnsmasq would not trigger dhcp-bridge to run. Thus the fixed ip would not be disassociated from instance until _disassociate_stale_fixed_ips() begins to run.  We need a fix for this problem.",
