In RH 1073624, their position was not very clear, and they indicated to wait for others recreate this problem. Now I can recreate this problem using latest Juno code. I believe it is caused by libvirt or underlying layer of code, but the its possibility is not very low on RHEL 6.5. It occurs several time during one week.",

This is usually caused by a failured at the I/O layer, eg a dead NFS server or dead iSCSI server.  The Red Hat bugzilla quoted in comment #1 had a root cause of a broken iSCSI server connection.\n\nPretty much all Nova can do is put the VM into an ERROR state. It is not safe to ignore this and mark the VM as shutoff, because if the stuck VM comes back to life it might start issuing I/O to the attached volumes again which will be dangerous if you've started a new VM instance with the same cinder volumes attached. So leaving in ERROR state is safest",
