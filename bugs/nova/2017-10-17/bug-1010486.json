Other operations instead return a 404 saying the server does not exist.\n\nFor example, on one essex deployment I get the following behaviour:\n\n    GET .../servers/not_present/os-security-groups\n    500 {\"computeFault\": {\"message\": \"The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation.\", \"code\": 500}}\n    POST .../servers/not_present/action\n    404 {\"itemNotFound\": {\"message\": \"Instance not_present could not be found.\", \"code\": 404}}",

Also removes old exception translation, ApiError no\n    longer exists and NotAuthorized shouldn't need handling at this level.\n    Includes tweak suggested by Mark McLoughlin in review.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaeada84dbadc232968f792c6f4855bf61cc5a5ae\n",
