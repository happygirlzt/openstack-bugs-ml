    "description": "Hello,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm not quite sure it's a bug or more of a very nice to have for everybody.  But last few days we've been investigating some weird behaviour which was due to the fact that the dhcp bridge wasn't working properly because /etc/nova/nova-dhcpbridge.conf was missing.  Would it be possible to have a DEBUG/VERBOSE/WARNING of some kind when it's missing?  Or even better, set the default options in nova-dhcpbridge and use them if /etc/nova/nova-dhcpbridge.conf is missing!\n\nThank you very much,\n\nDave",
