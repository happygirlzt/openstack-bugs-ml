Previously if the user did no belong to the project, the user was added to a project when adding their role to said project.\n\nIt's debatable if the user should be added to the user_project_association automatically or not, but at the very least the user running the nova-manage command should probably be told that the user's role was added to the project, but that the user is not globally associated with the project (or perhaps the role should not be added at all if they're not globally associated?).",
