In other words, block\n    devices could only be tagged in 2.32 and network interfaces between\n    2.32 and 2.36 inclusively.\n    \n    This patch documents this behaviour in api-ref and introduces\n    microversion 2.42, which re-adds the tag in all the right places.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia0869dc6f7f5bd347ccbd0930d1d668d37695a22\n    Closes-bug: 1658571\n    Implements: blueprint fix-tag-attribute-disappearing\n",
