    "description": "The current vmware driver requires the user to run tomcat on each nova-compute node to serve up a wsdl file, specified using the nova.conf option vmwareapi_wsdl_loc.  \n\nThis is a workaround for a bug in the ESX 4.1 WSDL, but is not necessary for newer versions of ESX, including the current 5.0 and 5.1 .  However, the current code ALWAYS requires the workaround.  \n\nWe should change this so that the driver can be started without the vmwareapi_wsdl_loc option, and that the driver only errors out if the resulting connection is to an unfixed version of vCenter/ESX.  \n\nShould be a very simple change to the code, see: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/vmwareapi/vim.py#L89",
