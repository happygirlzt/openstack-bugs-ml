I used fuel installer and grizzly on centos, I used auto assign floating ips in network settings(nova, flat DHCP) and nova in savanna seetings for hortonworks plug in. (I even checked thatnetwork settings are correct in fuel) And when I go to the console of any node instance it says \"Booting from hard disk\", also the console log is empty. Can some1 please tell what can be done ?\n(aim : To deploy hdp 1.3 plugin on savanna 0.2/0.2.2)",
