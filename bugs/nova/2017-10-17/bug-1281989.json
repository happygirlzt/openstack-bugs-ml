One of them is using the hw_disk_bus image property which, if present, is inherited by volumes created from an image.\n\nWhen booting from a volume that has this property defined, even though we might think it will be considered when selecting the bus, it is ignored because the code that guesses the bus and device name for volume BDMs expects it to be defined in the same BDM.",
