My two explanations are: inadvertent use of an admin user, or weird code being used\n\n@Jose: can you confirm that your patch (ec2.patch) allowed you to work around the issue? If yes, could you check the following trail and that the code you execute has this present:\n\nnova/api/ec2/cloud.py: your patch adds search_opts['project_id'] = context.project_id before calling self.compute_api.get_all\n\nnova/compute/api.py: get_all just copies search_opts to filters, calls _get_instances_by_filters, which in turn calls instance_get_all_by_filters\n\nnova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py: if not context.is_admin: [...] filters['project_id'] = context.project_id\n\nSo for context.is_admin=False, the patch looks like a noop to me... at least with current stable/essex code.\n",
