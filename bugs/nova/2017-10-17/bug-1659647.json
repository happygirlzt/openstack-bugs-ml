This means that the conditionals in the '_update_usage_from_instance' (singular) method always indicate that the current instance is considered new and the various update methods for that instance will always be called.\n\nIn the case of the calls to the placement API, this means there are many extra calls which could be avoided.\n\nRemoving the clear() call results in no unit or functional test failures. A test run the gate will be tried.",
