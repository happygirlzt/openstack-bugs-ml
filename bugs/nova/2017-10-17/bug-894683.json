    "description": "when we try to allocate a floating ip to tenant using dashboard or novaclient cli, it just hangs, doesn't return.\nThe failure is because the network driver is FlatManager which doesn't support allocation of floating ips.\n\nnova-api has casted the message to network service correctly. But while returning the method in __getattr__() of nova.server.Service, it fails due to AttributeError as there is no such method as allocate_floating_ip in FlatManager. As a result the network service doesn't return anything and nova-api doesn't get any response and user sees his nova command or dashboard hung.\n\nApart from this specific case, it might happen that some drivers doesn't support some functionality. Service need to ensure  return atleast a method that returns \"NotImplementedError()\"",
