A snippet of nova-compute.log: http://paste.openstack.org/show/28444/\n\nThe error happens in the /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/virt/configdrive.py file, method _make_vfat, line 116. The issue is caused by the attempt to chown a mounted vfat partition. As far as I have tested, this cannot be done even by root, even though it can be done with other filesystems such as ext3.\n\nTo fix the issue all that it takes is to remove the problematic chown call altogether and to include two additional options to the mount command: uid=<nova_uid>,gid=<nova_gid>. My own fix:\n\n            _out, err = utils.trycmd('mount', '-o', 'loop,uid=%s,gid=%s' % (os.getuid(), os.getgid()), path, mountdir,\n                                     run_as_root=True)\n\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 with Folsom and python-nova package version 2012.2+git201210091907~precise-0ubuntu1.",
