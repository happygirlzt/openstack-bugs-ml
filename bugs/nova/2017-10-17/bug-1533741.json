    "description": "It seems that there are no unit tests for the nova.rpc module. Because nova.rpc is used by many other modules, changes to it do cause UT failures. But it is possible to remove essential parts without failing any unit tests. An example of this is removing TRANSPORT.cleanup() from the cleanup function.\n\nTests should be added for all of the public functions, along with tests for RequestContextSerializer for both a given base, and a null base.",
