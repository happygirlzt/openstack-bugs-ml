    "description": "Nova baremetal requires PXE booting of nodes, but the network code in nova doesn't arrange for PXE DHCP options to be supplied [by quantum].\n\nIn the same manner that the MAC address limitations are exported by the driver, DHCP options should be exported by the driver and then passed onto the network provider - and for the quantum driver we can pass these onto the port for quantum.\n\nIn nova/compute/manager.py:\n    def _build_instance(self, context, request_spec, filter_properties,\n...\n                macs = self.driver.macs_for_instance(instance)\n        \n                network_info = self._allocate_network(context, instance,\n                        requested_networks, macs, security_groups)\n\n\nI suggest changing that to be something like\n                macs = self.driver.macs_for_instance(instance)\n                dhcp_options = self.driver.dhcp_options_for_instance(instance)        \n                network_info = self._allocate_network(context, instance,\n                        requested_networks, macs, security_groups, dhcp_options)\n\nthat calls _allocate_network which calls\nself.network_api.allocate_for_instance\n\n- and self.network_api for quantum environments is nova/network/quantumv2/api.py's API instance - so once dhcp_options gets down to there, you can use the Quantum API's directly and poke it in when the port is allocated/updated.",
