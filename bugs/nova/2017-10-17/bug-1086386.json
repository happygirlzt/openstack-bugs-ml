    "description": "Can no longer explicitly configure the libvirt cache mode for disk devices\n\nIn past versions of Nova it was possible to explicitly configure the cache mode of disks via the libvirt XML template. The new approach makes this a derived setting of either \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cwritethrough\u201d based on the support of O_DIRECT. Whilst this provides a good set of default settings it removes the ability of the cloud provider to use other modes such as \u201cwriteback\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d which are valuable in certain configurations.\n\nThe proposed change would allow the cache mode to be directly specified via configuration settings so as to override the default behaviour.",

The current approach\n    makes this a derived setting of either \u201cnone\u201d or \u201cwritethrough\u201d based\n    on the support of O_DIRECT. Whilst this provides a good set of default\n    settings it removes the ability of the cloud provider to use other\n    modes such as \u201cwriteback\u201d and \u201cunsafe\u201d which are valuable in certain\n    configurations.\n    \n    This change allows the cache mode to be specified on a per-disk type\n    basis. If a disk type does not have a cache mode specified then the\n    default behaviour remains unchanged.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    bug 1086386\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d296fe0b4b9b976db02db90ad69fd299cd2096a\n",
