The (presumably correct?) nova-manage cell_v2 simple_cell_setup command should handle getting the transport URL from the -c <config> file, and that should default to /etc/nova/nova.conf.  Also, the transport_url should work when you cut/paste it from nova.conf?\n\n4. puppet-nova should probably handle this dance (assuming 1 above is not possible), but I'm not clear how we detect when to run this command - according to the git history it should be idempotent, but are there reasons to not run it every update?",

The problem is that this does not include\n    anwyay to indicate that it's already been run if we need to trigger some\n    different actions on subsequent runs.  As part of the Newton to Ocata\n    upgrade, we need to be able to run the cell v2 setup in a different\n    order than on a traditional install. We need a way for the puppet\n    scripts that ultimately get run to know if it's an upgrade or install\n    action. This change adds the creation of an undercloud_upgrade fact that\n    will be used when the upgrade process is run. Additionally a new script\n    called instack-upgrade-undercloud has been created to be used when\n    upgrade. The use of instack-install-undercloud will cause the install\n    flow to be execuated, while the instack-upgrade-undercloud will set the\n    fact to true to allow for the puppet scripts to use the upgrade flow.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie3cb21e30334fe8ffc0a9d6e707b42269b64c9ec\n    Related-Bug: #1649341\n    Related-Blueprint: undercloud-upgrade\n",

This change\n    switches the undercloud upgrade process to use the\n    instack-upgrade-undercloud script which will expose the fact that we are\n    running an upgrade process to the underlying puppet scripts.\n    \n    Change-Id: I493204117ca158e99f706770a02fbb7f6392673b\n    Depends-On: Ie3cb21e30334fe8ffc0a9d6e707b42269b64c9ec\n    Related-Bug: #1649341\n    Related-Blueprint: undercloud-upgrade\n",
