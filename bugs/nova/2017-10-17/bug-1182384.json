            "content": "This was the conversation I had with Sean Dague in IRC back on 6/18:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/44543/\n\nWhen Sean is talking about catching the 400 and translating it to a 404, I think that's tied to the second option in the mailing list thread here:\n\nhttp://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-July/011666.html\n\n\"> 2) Encapsulate all calls to validate_id() in a try/catch HTTPBadRequest and raise a HTTPNotFound instead (exception translation)\"\n\nHowever, later when I talked to Sean on 7/24 he suggested I could try to fix the nova security group id validation issue by using this patch as a template:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/34559/\n\nIn that patch nova-network and neutron are validating name/description differently (neutron wasn't actually validating name/description), and it tries to move the validation into the base class.  I'm not actually sure how that applies to the id validation since that's implemented in both the nova-network and neutron SecurityGroupBase implementations in nova.\n\nSo it sounds like Sean thinks we should return 404 in either case when the id is invalid, but I've also seen the proposed tempest patch to fix the nova tests in tempest if neutron is being used, and I didn't understand the problem with those (maybe because the client is forced to know the api implementation in nova?).\n\nAnyway, could probably follow up on the mailing list or try to get a discussion going in #openstack-nova IRC?",

            "content": "Today, I spent some time running tempest/tests/compute/security_groups/test_security_group_rules.py (the test case mentioned in the bug description). I ran it in two different devstack instances: one with nova network and the other with neutron. This is the summary of the results:\n\n1) In the instance with nova network: when method test_security_group_rules_create_with_invalid_id attempts to create rules in a security group that doesn't exist and the security group id is a string convertible to an integer, the response is a 404, which is what it expects. When the same method is modified to provide a security group id that is a string not convertible to integer, the response is a 400, and it fails.\n\n2) In the instance with neutron: when method test_security_group_rules_create_with_invalid_id attempts to create rules in a security group that doesn't exist and the security group id is a string convertible to an integer, the response is a 400 and it fails. When the same method is modified to provide a security group id that is a valid uuid, the response is a 404, which is what it expects.\n\nBased on this behavior, I propose that we don't have a bug. When this test provides a security group id in the correct format to the nova api (integer string for nova network, uuid for neutron) the response is the expected 404. Conversely, when this test provides a security group id  in an incorrect format, both nova network and neutron return a 400. In my opinion, these are correct behaviors ",
