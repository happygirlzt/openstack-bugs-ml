There may be other calls to the Cinder API (that deal with volumes) that Nova does not handle an exception from. Exceptions from those calls will need to be handled, too.\n\nIn order to reproduce the above exception:\n\nAdd 'raise exception.VolumeIsBusy(message=\"sample\")'  to the top of the begin_detaching function in cinder/api.py.\nrestart c-api.\nAfter attaching a volume in OpenStack, attempt to detach it.
