    "description": "Baremetal deploy helper will fail with the below error if the flavor root_mb is exactly equal to the disk size, because sfdisk is leading with 1MB (to compensate for a bug in ubuntu raring). Simple work around is for flavor root_mb to be smaller than physical disk; this will work if root_mb is much smaller, or if it is just 1MB smaller, than the disk. Another solution would be to deduct 1MB from root_mb when partitioning.\n\n===========================\n\n2013-04-22 17:25:57,992.992 28920 ERROR nova.virt.baremetal.deploy_helper [-] Cmd     : sudo nova-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf sfdisk -uM /dev/disk/by-path/ip-192.\n0.2.67:3260-iscsi-iqn-eabc30c7-7161-4824-a3c3-cea2ddb1cecb-lun-1\n2013-04-22 17:25:57,993.993 28920 ERROR nova.virt.baremetal.deploy_helper [-] StdOut  : \nDisk /dev/disk/by-path/ip-192.0.2.67:3260-iscsi-iqn-eabc30c7-7161-4824-a3c3-cea2ddb1cecb-lun-1: 10240 cylinders, 64 heads, 32 sectors/track\nOld situation:\n\n2013-04-22 17:25:57,994.994 28920 ERROR nova.virt.baremetal.deploy_helper [-] StdErr  : Checking that no-one is using this disk right now ...\nOK\n\nsfdisk: ERROR: sector 0 does not have an msdos signature\n /dev/disk/by-path/ip-192.0.2.67:3260-iscsi-iqn-eabc30c7-7161-4824-a3c3-cea2ddb1cecb-lun-1: unrecognized partition table type\nNo partitions found\nWarning: given size (10240) exceeds max allowable size (0)\n\nsfdisk: bad input",
