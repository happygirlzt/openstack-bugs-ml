    "description": "The XenAPI driver will attach VDIs to the compute domU for the purposes of creating/resizing disks, injecting data and some other reasons. If nova-compute is killed in the middle of this process, or the domU is shutdown uncleanly, the VDI will still be attached to the compute domU.\n\nThis can cause a couple of problems:\n- It can leave VDIs attached to domU which can make cleaning up unused VDIs difficult\n- If this happens often enough, the maximum number of VBDs can be reached, preventing new instances from being built",
