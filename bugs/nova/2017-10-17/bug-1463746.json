The last known state is \"active\" and it should still be possible to access the instance via network. Right know there is no \"unknown / undefined\" state in nova [1]. Is this bug maybe a change request?\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/vm_states.py\n",

So it would be better to set the instance state to  e.g. \"unknown\" because the nova api is not able to give the correct result with the data it have. If a nova-compute service is down and instances are active prior registering the service is down, the instance state for this instances should not report \"active\".\n\nHope that clarifies my problem.",
