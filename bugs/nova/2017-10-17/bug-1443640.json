    "description": "When an instance is saved in a parent cell the db update happens there and then the update is sent to a child cell.  When the child cells updates its database it then sends that update back up to the parent to be save there again.  The propagation of the change back up to the parent can overwrite subsequent changes there causing data to be lost.  Updates from a parent->child or child->parent should go one direction only and not propagate back to the originating cell.",
