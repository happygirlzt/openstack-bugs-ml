We also fix up how some of the tests mock the random.choice\n    method, because now we give it a list of sets (of cpus), but also\n    because it is now easier to catch a regression since we actually use the\n    passed value.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0d740170db52a4777924648683ac98de9cf4b3cf\n    Closes-bug: 1372845\n",
