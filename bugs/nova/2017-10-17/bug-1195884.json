This checks if the context is valid before\n    attempting to repopulate base images.\n    \n    This is a bit of a hack, as it assumes that the base images already\n    exist on the system, and will fail if they don't. However, it reduces\n    the number of failures (without this, every downed guest is guaranteed\n    to error when coming back up for resume_guest_state_on_host_boot).\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1195884\n    Change-Id: Ibac52f5d1b4e5ab2adb0a561659e6df8c7c1f40f\n",
