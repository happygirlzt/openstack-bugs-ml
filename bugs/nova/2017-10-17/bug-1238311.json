This is the first step in being able to rebuild a baremetal instance with a new image but preserve the data on the ephemeral disk.\n\nWe want the partition order to be: ephemeral swap root\nWe want root last, is that we put root at the start to stop it resizing so we could use all the space for a new  partition, but this use of ephemeral makes that explicit. so instead having the extra space to allow root to resize will make it safer to do takeovernode with slightly larger images.",
