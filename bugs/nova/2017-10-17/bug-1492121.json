Nova instance is deleted\n    2. Volume will still be in 'in-use' state\n    3. Backend VM will still be on the VC\n    \n    In the event that a StorageError error is raised then we will\n    proceed to delete the instance.\n    \n    All other exceptions will be raised so as to not delete the cinder\n    volume.\n    \n    Change-Id: I99c59cb94d487322011071d24504dd9401879dba\n    Closes-bug: #1492121\n",
