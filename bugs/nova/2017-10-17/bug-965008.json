Fixes bug 965008\n    \n    Added length check for label. Without length check,\n    label is truncated. Warning is shown by sqlalchemy layer.\n    \n    Raise an InvalidInput exception when validation fails (like\n    rest of the surroudning code)\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae517e03099e36f1c00f4742049834a9231a2fff\n",
