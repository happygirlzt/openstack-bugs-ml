            "content": "live_migration_downtime, live_migration_downtime_steps and live_migration_downtime_delay represent maximum values. I don't see in the code where those values are overridden by the LIVE_MIGRATION_*_MIN values unless they are less than those minimum values. I only see the LIVE_MIGRATION_*_MIN values referenced in the files I've linked below:\n\nInitializes the config values, sets defaults:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/conf/libvirt.py#L29\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/conf/libvirt.py#L268\n\nChecks that the max values aren't less than the min values:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L5985\n\nIn addition, I ran the test_live_migration_downtime_steps unit test and verified that the downtime values specified in the test weren't being overwritten. I also changed the values in the test to be less than the MIN values and they were overwritten as expected.\n\nCan you provide more insight into when you are seeing this behavior? Could you perhaps attach your nova conf and some logs for when you see this behavior?\n\nOr maybe someone else with more knowledge of live migration and libvirt can offer some insight on what could be happening here?",
