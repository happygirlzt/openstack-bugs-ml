This\n      simplifies a number of things.\n    ZoneManager and HostManager classes to use are now flags.  This allows\n      one to extend the current classes and use them.\n    HostManager uses a HostState class to keep info about hosts.  This class\n      needs to be extendable.  Since it's very much tied to the HostManager,\n      the HostState class to use is not a flag.  It is, instead, a class\n      variable in HostManager.\n    Filtering functions now accept a single host to filter.  This improves\n      performance by not having to build a new array of hosts within every\n      filter function.\n    Filtering functions now accept a more generic 'filter_properties'\n      dictionary which we can fill with information available for filtering.\n      Adding additional data to this 'filter_properties' can be done by\n      subclassing.\n    Weighing functions now accept this 'filter_properties', also, although\n      it's poorly named ATM.  Will be cleaned up in a future branch when I\n      move some weighing functions into the host manager.\n    Filtering tests are true unit tests now.\n    test_zones was moved from top level to under scheduler as zone_manager\n      tests and refactored to be true unit tests.\n    Host tests are true unit tests now.\n    Other minor cleanups\n    \n    Change-Id: I0ef2acef6639b4500c400c18cf2c673cb80f0150\n",
