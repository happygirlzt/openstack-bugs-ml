Working on it today :)\n\nIt seems that the trouble starts when the nova client requests the deleted image, the server happily replies with:\n\nREQ: curl -i https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/641237/images/088d978f-c387-41bd-83c7-918a0d4b38c0 -X GET -H \"X-Auth-Project-Id: 641237\" -H \"User-Agent: python-novaclient\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Auth-Token: bf8001da-14a5-4dbc-a72f-3d1c4d92059a\"\n\nRESP: [200] {'date': 'Wed, 24 Apr 2013 02:00:17 GMT', 'content-length': '666', 'content-type': 'application/json', 'x-compute-request-id': 'req-2adcb4df-5203-419c-86cd-3cbb4fdd5b60', 'server': 'Jetty(8.0.y.z-SNAPSHOT)'}\nRESP BODY: {\"image\": {\"status\": \"DELETED\", \"updated\": \"2013-04-24T01:50:50Z\", \"name\": \"temp_snapshot\", \"links\": [{\"href\": \"https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2/641237/images/088d978f-c387-41bd-83c7-918a0d4b38c0\", \"rel\": \"self\"}, {\"href\": \"https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/641237/images/088d978f-c387-41bd-83c7-918a0d4b38c0\", \"rel\": \"bookmark\"}, {\"href\": \"https://dfw.servers.api.rackspacecloud.com/641237/images/088d978f-c387-41bd-83c7-918a0d4b38c0\", \"type\": \"application/vnd.openstack.image\", \"rel\": \"alternate\"}], \"created\": \"2013-04-24T01:32:16Z\", \"progress\": 0, \"minRam\": 512, \"minDisk\": 20, \"id\": \"088d978f-c387-41bd-83c7-918a0d4b38c0\", \"metadata\": {}}}\n\n------\n\nI think the proper behaviour should be, don't show deleted images to the user, even if they request them by ID. Only admin's should see deleted images.\n\nI'm not 100% sure yet if showing deleted images is bad. Do you have an opinon @mikalstill ?\n\nCurrently I'm digging  into the nova code to see what's happening there.",
