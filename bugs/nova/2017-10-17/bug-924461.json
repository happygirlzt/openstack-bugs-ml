This adds a call down to the hypervisor\n    driver to get the ip and the initiator name for the vm before calling\n    initialize connection. This connection is passed down to the volume\n    driver so that it can be used to authenticate when the hypervisor\n    tries to connect to the volume.\n    \n     * Adds initiator initialize_connection\n     * Makes a call to driver to get initiator name and ip address\n     * Gets initiator from openiscsi for libvirt\n     * Gets initiator from config for xenapi\n     * Add tests for the driver calls\n     * Fixes bug 924461\n    \n    Change-Id: I5b6a2dd84560c7f7b447571e0abf0993e5512ca0\n",
