If that is not specified, it uses the value in\n    the context.\n    \n    Note: read_deleted defaults to \"no\" in the context.\n    \n    The two exceptions are:\n     aggregate_host_get_all\n     aggregate_get_all\n    \n    In this case, it is better for read_deleted=yes to be the default\n    So in this case the context cannot be used, as that would default\n    to read_deleted=no. In this case you must explicity override\n    read_deleted, the context is totally ignored, as before.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idb048a592d8c6b788651d131a3345e70989c0ec4\n",

There should also be no need to pass read_deleted='no' because\n    that is the default.\n    \n    Really, the only place there should be any mention of read_deleted is\n    where we want read_deleted='yes' behaviour e.g.\n    \n      - In tests, where we want to check the operational_state of an\n        aggregate after it has been deleted\n    \n      - Where we want to support undeleting an aggregate or aggreate host\n    \n    Change-Id: I916a8d189a33d7f30838cccb26531a024066ef96\n",
