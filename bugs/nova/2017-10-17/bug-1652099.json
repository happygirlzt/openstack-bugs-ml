This is not the case. It simply adds one unless the existing application has not, which means that we'd need/want to add another bit of middleware in the placement stack and then send additional headers on every requests from the scheduler and resource tracker. All of which seems a bit much if we make sure we get the request id of the response into the logs (which is started at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/414230/ and I'll continue on).\n\nIf we were to add request response body logging, that presumably would be best served as a piece of middleware that, in the event of debug being true, effusively logged. There are ways for people to add that sort of thing to their web server, though, so I'm not sure why we need/want/should build that into the app?",

            "content": "I spent a very small amount of time investigating what it would take to get the new context.global_id into the headers provided when making a request to placement from scheduler's report client.\n\nIt's non-trivial because we have only one client in a process, not a client per user's request. Nor do we pass context when making requests of the placement API. It appears select_destinations gets a context, but it's not sure if that one eventually tracks back to the request made of the compute API. We have access to info about the user in various places, but that doesn't obviously help us get back to the original context.\n\nSo a fair amount of plumbing will need to be adjusted (unless I'm wrong, which is entirely possible).",
