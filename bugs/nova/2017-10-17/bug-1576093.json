Vhost-net kernel doesn't use shared log so the verification is not used and apparmor profiles won't block the live migration. With customers using vhost-user that might still cause migration problems, but, likely, those are the vast minority.\n\ncommit 0d34fbabc13891da41582b0823867dc5733fffef\nAuthor: Rafael David Tinoco <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 24 15:35:03 2016 +0000\n\n    vhost: migration blocker only if shared log is used\n\n    Commit 31190ed7 added a migration blocker in vhost_dev_init() to\n    check if memfd would succeed. It is better if this blocker first\n    checks if vhost backend requires shared log. This will avoid a\n    situation where a blocker is added inappropriately (e.g. shared\n    log allocation fails when vhost backend doesn't support it).\n\n    Signed-off-by: Rafael David Tinoco <email address hidden>\n    Reviewed-by: Marc-Andr\u00e9 Lureau <email address hidden>\n    Reviewed-by: Michael S.
