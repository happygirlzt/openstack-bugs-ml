            "content": "I'm not sure that X-Forwarded-For is the right way to do this. We already use it to represent the origin of the request, and while we could add the load balancer in via \"X-Forwarded-For: client-address, lb-url\" it would require parsing the forwarded for and taking the second value, which seems fragile to me.\n\nI'd like to suggest the following:\n\nIf you are using keystone, you should be able to change your endpoint to have https to get keystone to return the proper value for the url.\n\nThe internal version of auth (not using keystone) keys off of the req.url for X-Server-Management-Url.  We should change that to construct the url based on the existing flags:\n\nDEFINE_string('osapi_host', '$my_ip', 'ip of api server')\nDEFINE_string('osapi_scheme', 'http', 'prefix for openstack')\nDEFINE_integer('osapi_port', 8774, 'OpenStack API port')\nDEFINE_string('osapi_path', '/v1.1/', 'suffix for openstack')\n\nThen the exact desired host/url is settable via the flags\n\nVish\n\nOn Dec 9, 2011, at 1:19 PM, Donald Ngo wrote:\n\n> Public bug reported:\n> \n> When we are going through a load balancer using HTTPS we need to utilize\n> the X-Forward-For header in order to tell the Nova API to pass back the\n> HTTPS url that came through the load balancer as the X-Server-\n> Management-Url\n> \n> Example:\n> \n> We send a request to a load balancer with the base url as https://my-\n> host.com/v1.1/\n> \n> In response header we receive: X-Server-Management-Url = http://my-\n> host.com/v1.1/\n> \n> What should happen is Nova should return X-Server-Management-Url =\n> https://my-host.com/v1.1/\n> \n> ** Affects: nova\n>     Importance: Undecided\n>         Status: New\n> \n> -- \n> You received this bug notification because you are subscribed to\n> OpenStack Compute (nova).\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/902346\n> \n> Title:\n>  Need to add support for X-Forwarded-For header\n> \n> Status in OpenStack Compute (Nova):\n>  New\n> \n> Bug description:\n>  When we are going through a load balancer using HTTPS we need to\n>  utilize the X-Forward-For header in order to tell the Nova API to pass\n>  back the HTTPS url that came through the load balancer as the X\n>  -Server-Management-Url\n> \n>  Example:\n> \n>  We send a request to a load balancer with the base url as https://my-\n>  host.com/v1.1/\n> \n>  In response header we receive: X-Server-Management-Url = http://my-\n>  host.com/v1.1/\n> \n>  What should happen is Nova should return X-Server-Management-Url =\n>  https://my-host.com/v1.1/\n> \n> To manage notifications about this bug go to:\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/902346/+subscriptions\n\n",
