What's happening is, after the creation of the primary disk, it is extended by #of Gigs you specified in ephemeral (from the flavor). This means you have to log in to your guest os and partition that space. Although, it is not working consistently for me, sometimes i get this error \"The capacity of the parent virtual disk and the capacity of the child disk are different\" and sometimes it works. Need to investigate further. ",
