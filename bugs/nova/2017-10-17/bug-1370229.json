If a user enables 4 subcores per core on a system with 16 CPUS, then total VCPUs reported by virsh and libvirt's getInfo() API changes from 16 to 64. \n\nHowever, the hypervisor details API still shows 16 for VCPUs. \n\nThis is because the total VCPUs of a host are only collected once; the first time libvirt driver obtains all the host stats, and that value is saved off and used from that point on every time the host stats are calculated.\n\n\nIn nova.virt.libvirt.driver.LibvirtDriver:\n\n    def _get_vcpu_total(self):\n        \"\"\"Get available vcpu number of physical computer.\n\n        :returns: the number of cpu core instances can be used.\n\n        \"\"\"\n        if self._vcpu_total != 0:\n            return self._vcpu_total\n\n        try:\n            total_pcpus = self._conn.getInfo()[2]\n....\n\nThis should be changed to always fetch the total VCPUs, instead of relying on it never changing.",
