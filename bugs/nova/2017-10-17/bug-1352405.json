While I agree with a terminology, it is correct only when hypervisors have local storage, aka local disks for virtual machine disks. \n\nIn case of ceph, glusterfs or any other shared FS, this value is wrong. Also, it's worth to mention here that Ceph has replica sets so that also should be taken under consideration. If this is not something that can be solved, the best solution would be that disk usage total is not displayed under \"Hypervisors\" in horizon when shared FS is used. ",
