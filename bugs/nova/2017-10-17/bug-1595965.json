    "description": "This is a strange one. I had setup my transport_url incorrectly which made me discover this. I am filing this bug because I believe there is one.\n\nWhen using a correctly formatted transport_url that was missing data _and_ multiple workers for conductor it would incorrectly parse the transport_url.\n\nHere is the incorrect transport_url:\n\nrabbit://<user>:<pass>@server01,server02/openstack\n\nThe correct transport_url should be:\n\nrabbit://<user>:<pass>@server01,<user>:<pass>@server02/openstack\n\nAccording to the docs [1], when the username and password is not specified, the server should be omitted from the list of servers. So for the incorrect transport_url only server01 would be setup.  Here is a list of scenarios and what the behavior I see is.\n\n* with the incorrect transport_url and a single thread all services contact only server01\n* with the incorrect transport_url and multiple threads all services contact only server01 _except_ conductor which will attempt to contact server02 with the default username and password\n* with the correct transport_url all services contact server01 and server02 properly\n\nTo reproduce this, get two rabbitmq hosts and set the incorrect transport_url and at least 2 conductor workers. Look at the rabbitmq logs on server02 and youll see it is trying to login via the guest user. Set the number of workers to 1 and notice there is no bad logins in rabbitmq logs. Fix the transport_url and it will use all servers appropriately no matter the number of workers.\n\nThe following is a gut feeling. I believe the issue is around the point it gets forked with oslo.service. It may not properly be reparsing the transport_url. I couldn't prove that though.\n\nNova versions tested: 13.0.0 and 13.1.0\nall libraries were within the upper-constraints for mitaka\n\n[1] http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.messaging/transport.html",
