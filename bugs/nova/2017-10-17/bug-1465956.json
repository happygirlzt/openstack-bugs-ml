    "description": "For libvirt dirver, It has already implemented how to stop a server(gracefully or hard), and which way used is controlled by \"clean_shutdown\" flag which come from nova.compute.api.API.stop(self, context, instance, do_cast=True,clean_shutdown=True) method. \n\nAnd above method is called by nova stop sever rest api, while this rest api does't support to deal with this flag(it always set the \"clean_shutdown\" flag as True), so I think we should add this support then user could choise which way to stop a server.\n\nThe openstack I used  is master and the hypervisor is kvm.",
