    "description": "When starting up, dnsmasq invokes \"nova-dhcpbridge init\" to prime its leases state. However, the format in which nova-dhcpbridge dumps its state is wrong. It's supposed to be in \"leasesfile\" format, while it's in \"dhcp-host\" format. The latter is meant for configurating the mapping from MAC to IP (i.e. it's a configuration file), while that former is a state snapshot.\n\nUp until dnsmasq 2.55 this caused dnsmasq's state to be primed with wrong information, but with dnsmasq 2.57 it causes a crash. I've reported the crash upstream.",
