But it's probably reproducible with amd64 UEFI instances too.\n\nnova creates a libvirt instance with <loader> and <nvram> elements, and libvirt refuses to implicitly delete the nvram file. nova should probably be taught to force that, which is what my suggested delete_configuration patch does.",

            "content": "My understanding is that using the VIR_DOMAIN_UNDEFINE_NVRAM flag[1] you are passing the --nvram argument and according to the documentation for undefine method this argument[2] is used for remove the nvram file.  I still need to check the process to create VMs, especially when it uses uefi and checks if that a copy of nvram is created for every new instance.  So, my question is if once that this change is applied is possible to create a new instance?\n\n[1] https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/d9a0a885e2b1cf3c9fc5260f9cdf4fc8a768f26c/tools/virsh-domain.c#L3681-L3682\n[2] https://github.com/libvirt/libvirt/blob/d9a0a885e2b1cf3c9fc5260f9cdf4fc8a768f26c/tools/virsh-domain.c#L3605",

            "content": "Yes, it is still possible to create an instance after changing only the delete method. The generated libvirt domain XML looks like this:\n\n  <os>\n    <type arch='aarch64' machine='virt'>hvm</type>\n    <loader readonly='yes' type='pflash'>/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_CODE.fd</loader>\n    <nvram template='/usr/share/AAVMF/AAVMF_CODE.fd'>/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/nvram/instance-00000005_VARS.fd</nvram>\n    <boot dev='hd'/> \n  </os>\n\nThat is, the nvram file is copied from a global template to an instance-specific file -- it's that file under /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/nvram that VIR_DOMAIN_UNDEFINE_NVRAM removes. It should arguably be using template=AAVMF_VARS.fd rather than AAVMF_CODE.fd, but that's unrelated to this and doesn't really matter.\n\n\nThe most annoying part of this change is feature detection. I think delete_configuration might have to know to try unsetting flags until the method works, as older libvirts don't support VIR_DOMAIN_UNDEFINE_NVRAM and I can't see a way to test at runtime. But in our environment we know the libvirt version, so we just pass the flag in unconditionally.",
