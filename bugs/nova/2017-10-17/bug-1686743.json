    "description": "This issue is being treated as a potential security risk under embargo. Please do not make any public mention of embargoed (private) security vulnerabilities before their coordinated publication by the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team in the form of an official OpenStack Security Advisory. This includes discussion of the bug or associated fixes in public forums such as mailing lists, code review systems and bug trackers. Please also avoid private disclosure to other individuals not already approved for access to this information, and provide this same reminder to those who are made aware of the issue prior to publication. All discussion should remain confined to this private bug report, and any proposed fixes should be added to the bug as attachments.\n\nOlder versions of libvirt included network storage authentication information on the qemu command line. If libvirt raises an exception which logs the qemu command line it used, for example an error starting a domain, this authentication information will end up in the logs. There is an existing CVE for this issue here:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-5160\n\nSpecifically, if a deployment is using ceph, a libvirt error starting a domain would log the cephx secret key and the monitor addresses on the qemu command line.\n\nThe issue has been resolved upstream. Users running qemu version 2.6 or later, and libvirt version 2.2 or later, are not vulnerable. No change is required in Nova to resolve this issue.\n\nRed Hat users running RHEL 7.3 or later are not vulnerable.\n\nIt's not 100% clear to me that an OpenStack CVE is required here as it's not a bug in an OpenStack component, and it's already fixed upstream. However, it did come to my attention after a user publicly posted their ceph credentials on IRC, so evidently some OpenStack users are running vulnerable systems, and this is a very common configuration.\n\nIn Nova, we currently have:\n\nMIN_LIBVIRT_VERSION = (1, 2, 9)\nMIN_QEMU_VERSION = (2, 1, 0)\n\nso anybody running the minimum supported versions will be vulnerable.",

It doesn't sound like there's much point to an embargo here unless it's possible for unprivileged users to intentionally trigger an exception (in which case the value may be leaked in Nova's service logs?).\n\nSince a dependency upgrade mitigates the issue and it sounds like there won't be any associated Nova patches, I'm inclined to treat this as C2 in our taxonomy (a vulnerability, but not in OpenStack supported code, e.g., in a dependency, https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy ) and recommend an OSSN letting consumers of Nova know they should upgrade to at least qemu 2.6 and libvirt 2.2 (or backport the relevant fixes to their qemu/libvirt versions). I'm subscribing the ossg-coresec team for input on this as well.",
