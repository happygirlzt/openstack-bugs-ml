            "content": "Hi Chuck,\n\nI will re-describe the problem I have as follows.\n\n1. The Arch.\nThere are three physical machines. One as controller, the other two as compute nodes. In the compute node, only nova-compute and libvirt-bin are installed. The other components are in the controller node.\n\n2. Version\nnova-compute             2012.1~rc1-0ubuntu2\nlibvirt-bin                      0.9.8-2ubuntu14\n\n3. Related Config flags\n--dhcpbridge=/usr/bin/nova-dhcpbridge\n--libvirt_use_virtio_for_bridges\n--connection_type=libvirt\n--libvirt_type=kvm\n--network_manager=nova.network.manager.FlatDHCPManager\n\n4. How to repeat the problem\nStart an instance. It is working alright at the beginning. Leave it there (running, but idle) for a few hours (Last time I waited for 48 hours), and then I discovered that I couldn't ping or ssh the instance. \nIf, however, you start another instance on the same physical machine, this newly started instance is still working alright at the beginning.\n\n5. Log messages\nThe nova log files do not show anything exceptional. However, in the libvirt-bin log (/var/log/libvirt/libvirtd.log), I found this:\n\n2012-03-26 02:43:19.972+0000: 12279: error : virNetDevGetIndex:656 : Unable to get index for interface vnet0: No such device\n2012-03-26 11:02:47.463+0000: 12285: error : virNetDevGetIndex:656 : Unable to get index for interface vnet2: No such device\n\n6. A temporary by-pass\nRestart the services of nova-compute and libvirt-bin, and then restart the instance. Then I can ping/ssh the instance again.\nHowever, this is not a long-term solution, because the network fail again every day.\n\nIs there any related reported bug? Any suggestions?",
