    "description": "When the resource tracker creates Inventory in the placement (v1.0) API for its VCPU, MEMORY_MB, and DISK_GB, max_unit is being set to 1.\n\nUntil https://review.openstack.org/#/c/392933/ the min_unit, max_unit and step_size constraints on Inventory were not being checked when making Allocations. When that enforcement merges, the resource tracker will no longer be able to make allocations of anything other than unit 1.\n\nThe immediate fix for this is for the value of max_unit to reflect the real limits on the machine (how many cores, how much RAM, how much disk) when creating Inventory. In the future fancier things will be possible.",
