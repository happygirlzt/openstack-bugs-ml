But it should be 'required'.\n\n* The description of 'security_groups' is \"One or more security groups. Specify the name of the security group in the name attribute. If you omit this attribute, the API creates the server in the default security group.\"\n  It is not proper in the response.\n\n* The description of 'id' is: \"The security group name or UUID.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"name\" is not proper here.\n\n* 'rules' is an array. So it had better to change the description in order to clarify that it is the list of security group rules.",
