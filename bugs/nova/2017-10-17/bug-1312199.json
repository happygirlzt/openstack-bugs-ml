(Most system nowadays uses the NO_HZ options, which means HZ=1000)\nIf the kernel parameter meaning would be changed to lpj@1000HZ would be also helpful.\n\nThe kernel uses relatively big sample for lpj measurement  and usually a relatively big 15%  error is not fatal.\nHigher then required lpj usually does not causes fatal issue, but it makes the system slower, the opposite can cause the system reads invalid data from a hardware register. Is it a real threat with an emulated hardware ? \n\nI tried to alter the kernel parameters on the f20 image with guestfish, it is working on f20, but even with the instruction [1], it has issue on Ubuntu 12.04 [2](gate).\n\nThe guestfish approach without HW acceleration is not fast.\nI will try to use a loop mount. \n\n[1] http://libguestfs.org/guestfs-faq.1.html\n[2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/81983/",

The more it knows and reacts to the specific behavior of operating systems it runs under kvm, the more that knowledge can become brittle or out dated.  Ie, in future linux kernels adding no_timer_check  might have negative side affects, and openstack will the be in the position of having to guess whether or not to add the parameter based on perceived version of the kernel that it is going to boot.  Worse, the image author will then be in the position of having to \"fight\" this guess.\n\n\nAnyway, with regard to ubuntu bug, 14.04 is fix-released in that it has VIRTIO_CONSOLE=y.  12.04 has VIRTIO_CONSOLE=m and that is available in the linux-generic as Robert stated. Clearly it should have beein in the -virtual or builtin.\n\n",
