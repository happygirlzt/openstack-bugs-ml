Does this mean, however that the storwize_svc driver that is being used to create the volumes should have an iSER option?\n\nShould the iSCSI driver be updated to do   look_for_device = glob.glob('/dev/disk/by-path/*%s' % device) or is it a valid config to do iscsi=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtISERVolumeDriver ?",

Figuring out a way to put that together for Kilo, perhaps, sounds like a better long term solution.",
