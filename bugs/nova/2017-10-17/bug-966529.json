    "description": "I have a 2 compute-node setup running multi_host.  If I assign a floating IP address to a VM and then migrate that VM to another compute host, the iptables NAT for that floating IP and the assignment of the IP to the physical network interface remain on the original host.  I would expect these to move with the live migration.\n\nThe networking entries from my nova.conf:\n\n# Networking\n--network_manager=nova.network.manager.FlatDHCPManager\n--force_dhcp_release\n--fixed_range=10.55.100.0/25\n--flat_network_dhcp_start=10.55.100.2\n--flat_interface=eth2.100\n--flat_network_bridge=br100\n--libvirt_use_virtio_for_bridges\n--dhcpbridge_flagfile=/etc/nova/nova.conf\n--dhcpbridge=/usr/bin/nova-dhcpbridge\n--allow_same_net_traffic\n--public_interface=eth1\n--multi_host\n\nIf I have a VM starting on node2 (fixed ip 10.55.100.2), I see this interface assignment for the floating IP (10.54.100.225):\neth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:30:48:f3:49:5d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 10.54.0.2/16 scope global eth1\n    inet 10.54.100.225/32 scope global eth1\n\nand iptables NAT entries (seen from iptables-save):\n-A nova-network-OUTPUT -d 10.54.100.225/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.55.100.2\n-A nova-network-PREROUTING -d 10.54.100.225/32 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.55.100.2\n-A nova-network-float-snat -s 10.55.100.2/32 -j SNAT --to-source 10.54.100.225\n\nAll those entries look good/correct to me.  Then I do a live-migration from node2 to node1.  After that, I verify that the VM has moved successfully (it has) and I can reach it through the fixed network (I can).  However, when I look at the floating network, all the entries from above are still present on node2!  Here's node2 output from \"ip a\" again:\n\neth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:30:48:f3:49:5d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 10.54.0.2/16 scope global eth1\n    inet 10.54.100.225/32 scope global eth1\n\nAnd then from node1:\neth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP qlen 1000\n    link/ether 00:30:48:f3:49:5f brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 10.54.0.1/16 scope global eth1\n\nI definitely would have expected that IP address to change from eth1 on node2 to eth1 on node1, since I'm running multi_host.  Consider that I may have done the live migration because I'm about to take node2 down for maintenance.  Additionally, no NAT entries for that floating ip were made on node1.  They remain on node2 as well.  All the fixed ip entries were moved as expected.\n\nRunning on Ubuntu 12.04.  Everything installed via apt-get.
