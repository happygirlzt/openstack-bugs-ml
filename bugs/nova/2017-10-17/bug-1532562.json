    "description": "If a child cell has compute nodes without a heartbeat update \nbut enabled (XXX state with \"nova-manage service list\") the child cell continues to consider the available resources of these compute nodes \nwhen updating the cell capacity.\nThis can be problematic when having several cells and trying to fill them completely.\nRequests are sent to the cell that can fit more instances of the requested type however when compute nodes are \"down\" the requests will fail with \"No valid host\" in the cell.\n\nWhen updating the cell capacity the \"disabled\" compute nodes are excluded. This should also happen if the compute node didn't have a heartbeat update during the \"CONF.service_down_time\".\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1) Have a cell environment with 2 child cells (A and B).\n2) Have nova-cells running in \"debug\". Confirm that the \"Received capacities from child cell\" A and B (in top nova-cell log) matches the number of available resources.\n4) Stop some compute nodes in cell A.\n5) Confirm that the \"Received capacities from child cell A\" don't change.\n6) Cell scheduler can send requests to cell A that can fail with \"No valid host\".",
