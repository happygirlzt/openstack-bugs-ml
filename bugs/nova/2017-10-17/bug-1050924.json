The first 3 octets will remain unchanged. If the\n# 4h octet is not 00, it will also used. The others will be\n# randomly generated.\n# 3 octet\n# base_mac = fa:16:3e:00:00:00\n# 4 octet\n# base_mac = fa:16:3e:4f:00:00\n\n# Maximum amount of retries to generate a unique MAC address\n# mac_generation_retries = 16\n\n\nThanks\nGary",
