And only just realized that we're only doing 2 byte utf for names, which was not the intent.\n\nYes, we should support up to 3 byte utf8. However we do strict validation on this, so this might require a microversion bump.\n\nThe UTF8 support has been so hit / miss in Nova to date that I think we really need a spec for this to straighten out all the places where we want to support utf8 from the user, and what lengths are required. Once we have that we can make all the changes in 1 API microversion. ",

In this case, when user creates a flavor using one of the characters out of range 0xFFFF, mysql uses \"????\" to store the given character and then no other character out of range 0XFFFF can be used in flavor creation as duplication is not allowed in providing flavor name. So the bug status could either be \"invalid\" or \"wont fix\".\n\n",
