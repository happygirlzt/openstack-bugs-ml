The driver currently\n    reports the disk usage of a datastore that has the largest capacity.\n    But it doesn't report a consolidated disk usage. As a result, the\n    node's storage capability is under-reported in many occassions.\n    \n    This patch fixes this issue by aggregating the disk freespace,\n    capacity from all attached datastores.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1220459\n    \n    Change-Id: I818a041f33a045773fc799de2c69628064ef8cbf\n",
