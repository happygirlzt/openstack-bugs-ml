Otherwise, you can't use this filter in combination with\n    other filters that act on un-scoped extra specs, because they may\n    conflict.\n    \n    This recently came up on the mailing list:\n    \n    http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2013-July/011421.html\n    \n    Fix bug 1198290.\n    \n    DocImpact - See updates to filter_scheduler.rst.\n    \n    Change-Id: I03d1d3268c800dc6982ffa4b13f8b9489428b991\n",
