    "description": "There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1. Copy VDI is needed so that we get a base-copy that has r/w permissions (we maybe able to optimize this away later by doing things differently\n\n2. _copy_partition is using dd to copy the data into the blank VHD which is causing the VHD to balloon up to its max size (instead of retaining its sparseness)\n\n3. rsync is having to send those long runs of zeros across the network\n\nWe can alleviate the problems of 2) and 3) by using a sparse_dd routing instead of plain dd. This will keep the sparseness of the VHD eliminating the need to send so much data across the network.",
