Stash a copy of them every time we reset\n    our changes so that we can detect changes in save().\n    \n    Note that this includes tests to some shelve tests which are now\n    wrong because they modify the instance's sys_meta prematurely.\n    Turns out, these are the tests that pointed out the need for\n    this tracking :)\n    \n    Related to blueprint unified-object-model\n    Fixes bug 1201776\n    \n    Change-Id: I3df462645979742379a41060cda5bb5084fddb20\n",
