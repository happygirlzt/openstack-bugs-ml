If this value is invalid, spawn() will fail with the error message:\n\nVMwareDriverException: A specified parameter was not correct.\n\nAs there are many parameters to CreateVM_Task, this error message does not help us narrow down the offending one. Unfortunately this error message is all that vSphere provides us, so we can't do better by relying on vSphere alone.\n\nAs this is a user-editable parameter, we should try harder to provide an indication of what the error might be. We can do this by validating the field ourselves. As there is no way I'm aware of to extract a canonical list of valid guestIds from a running vSphere host, I think we're left embedding our own list and validating against it. This is not ideal, because:\n\n1. We will need to update our list for every ESX release\n2. A simple list will not take account of the ESX version we're running against (i.e. we may have a list for 5.5, but be running against 5.1, which doesn't support everything on our list)\n\nConsequently, to maintain a loose coupling we should validate the field, but only warn for values we don't recognise. vSphere will continue to return its non-specific error message, but there will be an additional indication of what the root cause might be in the logs.",

We limit\n    ourselves to logging a warning because we don't want to tightly couple\n    ourselves to the vSphere behaviour. We can't guarantee that this is\n    the reason the RPC call failed, or that it is the only reason the RPC\n    call failed.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    This change doesn't impact the behaviour of the VMware driver except\n    that it will emit an additional warning message to the logs under the\n    circumstances described. However, given the potential for\n    user misconfiguration, we should describe this pitfall in the docs.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1357263\n    Change-Id: I10e0982c6c450facdeea41c7f1d266e20a924d08\n",
