If a user\n    specifies their own /root/.ssh/authorized_keys via 'injected files',\n    that will take precedence.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1152713\n    \n    Note: Images for Xen that use nova-agent will need to have /root/.ssh\n    pre-created with modes 0700 on those directories.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: I190c6b3f67099061b5316baa45b8bfcd1a5e53f6\n",
