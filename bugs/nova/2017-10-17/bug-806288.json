    "description": " I am using openstack cloud, setup at present has two servers. Base OS is ubuntu, on cloud controller(hostname - in01emt16) network, volume, scheduler services are running and there is one compute node(hostname - in01emt17).\n\n  I am able to run ubuntu prepackaged images as well as custom built images from scratch including ubuntu natty. All my attempts to create CentOS, Fedora, RHEL6 custom images has failed.\n\n  Running Fedora instance, the controller assigns an ip 192.168.3.x to instance which some how is not getting registered by Feodra OS, after doing vnc to running instance & change to static ip assigned by the controller now can ping from controller to the instance. Basically manual assignment of IP is working while dhcp isn't.\n\nAny insights ?\n\nThanks,\nSudhir",

            "content": "One of community member \"Jordan Rinke\" pointed out I could connect to instance by using vnc client software by knowing the instance display session id on the compute node even if ping doesn't work.\n\n  The instance is Fedora 15, connected to instance through vnc client & noticed the network injection by controller was happening into \"/etc/network/interfaces\" while Fedora/RHEL uses \"/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0\" for interfaces.\n\n  Already when the instance started controller had injected the IP 192.168.3.x with NETMASK, BROADCAST, GATEWAY into \"/etc/network/interfaces\".\n\n  Edited \"/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0\" & changed\n\nfrom BOOTPROTO=dhcp\n\nto\n\nfrom BOOTPROTO=static\n\n  Also added IP 192.168.3.x with NETMASK, BROADCAST, GATEWAY into the ifcfg-eth0 file & restarted network service on which eth0 was functioning normally. Was able to ping cloud controller, compute node & other instances.\n\n  The issue is mentioned in the URL \"http://docs.openstack.org/bexar/openstack-compute/admin/content/ch04s01.html\" under Note which is as follows :\n\n  The configuration injection currently only works on Linux-style systems that keep networking configuration in /etc/network/interface.\n\n  Debian based flavors use \"/etc/network/interfaces\" while RHEL/Fedora uses \"/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0\" for NIC configuration.\n\n On the cloud controller which hosts storage, network & scheduler am using \"FlatDHCPmanager\"\n\n--network_manager=nova.network.manager.FlatDHCPManager\n\n  If anyone in the openstack community can point me out how does RHEL/Fedora images/instances handle this network injection it would be very helpful & appreciated.\n\nThanks,\nSudhir",
