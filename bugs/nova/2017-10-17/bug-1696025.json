Is it ACTIVE with a power state of SHUTDOWN or PAUSED ?\n\nThere are cases in the compute manager where we verify the compare the state between the hypervisor and the DB, and if we can't find the instance on the hypervisor side, then we stop the instance.\n\nIn general, that means you hitted some problem when migrating that instance and traces can be found in logs.",
