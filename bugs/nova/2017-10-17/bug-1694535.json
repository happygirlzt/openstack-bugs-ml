This is a result of refactoring\n    this code in I7a53e08f3fad6abb27a1d8ad425b4f916341cab3.\n    \n    The related unit test is pretty brittle so it's easy to\n    see how this was missed in testing, plus we don't have\n    integration testing for live migration rollbacks.\n    \n    This change fixes the call and makes the test a bit less\n    brittle, but would be cleaner if it could use autospec\n    although figuring out how to make that work eludes me.\n    \n    Change-Id: I12088f57f6228460b4810d39e9fca93bd589d70b\n    Closes-Bug: #1694535\n",
