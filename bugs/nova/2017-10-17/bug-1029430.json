If so, have you removed the virbr0 NATed bridge?  When I remove that from autostart and reboot, I do not see the rule.\n\nAssuming I understand this right, does that mean we should have the libvirt-bin upstart job always unconditionally add that rule?",

As part of the verification process for this bug, the OpenStack components have been deployed and configured across multiple nodes using quantal-proposed as an installation source. After successful bring-up and configuration of the cluster, a number of exercises and smoke tests have be invoked to ensure the updated package did not introduce any regressions. A number of test iterations were carried out to catch any possible transient errors.\n\nThese proposed packages were deployed and tested in several different configurations.  Attached are tarballs with various test logs from each configuration.  In addition to the base components, variables in deployments include:\n\nquantal_folsom.tar: nova-network (FlatDHCP), glance (Ceph backend), cinder (Ceph backend),\nquantal_folsom_nova-volume.tar: nova-network (FlatDHCP), glance (local file), nova-volume (iSCSI backend)\nquantal_folsom_quantum.tar: quantum (OVS plugin), glance (Ceph backend), nova-volume (Ceph backend)\n\nPlease note the versions_tested file in each tarball, which contains details about relevant package versions installed and tested.\n\nFor records of upstream test coverage of this update, please see the Jenkins links in the comments of the relevant  upstream code-review(s):\n\nTrunk review: https://review.openstack.org/18336\nStable review: https://review.openstack.org/18450\n\nAs per the provisional Micro Release Exception granted to this package by the Technical Board, we hope this contributes toward verification of this update.",
