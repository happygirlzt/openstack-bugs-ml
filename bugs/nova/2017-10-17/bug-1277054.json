It was coming from the instance not having system metadata\n    populated.\n    \n    While the route cause is a combination of using non-object instances\n    that were not populated with system metadata. With an object, the system\n    metadata would lazyload as required, but clearly not with a pure dict.\n    \n    This fix ensures the non-object instance has system_metadata, so the\n    extraction of the flavor from the instance, during notifications sent\n    during unrescue, now succeed.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1277054\n    Change-Id: I63bdd6c49505557829241869fd3efd2b2754530b\n",
