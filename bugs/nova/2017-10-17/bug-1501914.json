This time the host discovered the first volume, but not the newly created (2nd) volume.   Also, the iSCSI sessions stay this time, they didn\u2019t get disconnected.\n \nIt seem like there might be a problem with when the newly added volume is being discover is not in proper order, the discover/rescan command is being use too early.\n\nAlso, tried the same with the Kilo Devstack version, and this version is working fine.",
