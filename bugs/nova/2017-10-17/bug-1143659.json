And bug 1076019 and bug 991941 are talking about the SAVING state of the captured image.\n\nIn other words, I think we need to make sure if the instance can be deleted when there is a snapshot for this instance.",

I would say that this bug is a special case of the other where instead of setting the snapshot to some error state, it is deleted together with the deleted instance.\n\nThe separately proposed fixes for the two are basically the same and this one could easily be re-based on top of https://review.openstack.org/25236 to handle this special case.\n\nFor bug 1064386, I think it must be handled as a cleanup during service init, and as such has a completely different fix.",
