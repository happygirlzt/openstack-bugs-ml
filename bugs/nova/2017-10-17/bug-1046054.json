Requests for all security groups vs. only those for the current scope should be differentiated as they were for everything else.\n\nAttempting to launch an instance with a security group from another project results in an API error (but thankfully doesn't crash nova like the volume attachment bug did).",

Since we don't pay attention to many of these standard\n    filters as yet, this stepping slightly off-piste is deemed worth it.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6157e408394d04096d21747d665e3b3aa6aa55de\n",
