I am unclear as to how long it is intented to be kept around -- at least the Kilo cycle, to be sure.\n\n@Dafna, what version of the Nova service are you running? If a previous version of Nova which contained the baremetal driver, you must initialize the \"nova_bm\" database schema if you wish to use it.\n\nPlease provide more detail so that we can reproduce this error.\n\nThanks,\nDevananda",
