For\n    compute osapi v3, we raise a BadRequest Exception to ensure the user\n    understands why he/she is not getting what he/she asks for.\n    \n    This patch also address some minor nits in other error messages.\n    \n    Fixed bug #1190777\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf606637a8acf9d20fc6cae0bed5c9a3ea0bf611\n",
