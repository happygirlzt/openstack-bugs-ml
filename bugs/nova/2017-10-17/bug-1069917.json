It mostly ignore it when table is created, but adding foreign key in table alter fail during bug in mysql. That is why you need also disable foreign keys. At this moment I usually manually edit migration files in nova, but I think it is possible to make patch from this modification. Problem is this patch affected all migration back in history and it is kind a ugly. Is there rules (best practices) describe when I can do that?",

IMHO, Nova has not supported NdbCluster for at least 4 release cycles now, as we rely heavily on foreign key relations.
