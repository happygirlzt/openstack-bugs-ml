This is fine for\n    our in memory sqlite db, but when talking to a real external\n    database, not so good.\n    \n    Since a second mysql test was added, we started racing on these\n    migrations them often hitting at the same time causing random fails\n    in gate.\n    \n    Fix this by moving all the mysql tests into 1 test function, so we\n    won't race.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1101874\n    \n    Change-Id: I7627f3bd510266c99af018d355f960b352573759\n",
