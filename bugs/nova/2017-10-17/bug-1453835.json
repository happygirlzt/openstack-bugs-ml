This issue happens when resizing on the same node.\n\nThis has been caught by our Kilo release integration tests where we tests all possible configurations and supported OSs (12k+ tempest tests). The issue does not happen on stable/juno, also tested the last time with the 2014.2.3 release.\n \nWe discussed to add additional tests in the CI for the single host resize case as this is a potential source of regressions like this one.
