An earlier submitted fix for this uses a mysql drop\n    statement. I think it's cleaner to use sqlalchemy to do this, as it's\n    done this way in other version migrations as well. Fix for bug 907254.\n    \n    Update: IBM from 1928 called, they want their 80 CPL limit\n    back. - on a more serious note, fixed jenkins PEP8 failure\n    Update2: Replaced tab by a spaces\n    Update3: Don't do Foreign Key stuff if the engine is sqlite\n    Update4: Add myself to the Authors file\n    Update5: With the correct mail address\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib021e0ddb2c80ee63888435a9e3761c053534160\n",
