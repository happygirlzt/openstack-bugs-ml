On both, rebooting my container makes it goes to SHUTOFF/Shutdown. It is not a normal behavior, right?\n\nAfter that,\nOn CentOS, when I do a nova start, I get the \"can't delete device /dev/loop0\" error. But it comes back to RUNNING anyway, and I can use and then delete the container without any errors.\nOn Ubuntu, when I do a nova start, I don't get any errors. The container goes back to RUNNING, and I can use it. But I realized that after, I cannot delete the container. I get the exception: \"libvirtError: Failed to kill process 12860: Permission denied\"",
