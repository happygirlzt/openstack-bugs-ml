    "description": "Upper constraints for 'hacking' lib doesn't work for pep8\n\nCouple days ago this patch was merged into Nova:\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/334048/11/nova/tests/unit/virt/libvirt/test_vif.py\n\nIt contains these lines:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0self.assertEqual(None, conf.vhost_queues)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0self.assertEqual(None, conf.driver_name)\n\nFrom pep8 point of view these lines are incorrect. Here 'assertIsNone' should be used (rule N318)\n\nBut during merge pep8 job was 'green'. Unfortunately some number of contributors faced with fails of 'tox -e pep8' command in local repos because of these lines. It has given rise to this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/407870/\nThis patch fixes current problem but it doesn't fix such problems in future.\n\nThe reason of green pep8 job was in 'hacking' lib. It was released 6 day ago and new release 0.13.0 has a bug, wich causes our problem.\n\nCommit with bug was already reverted from 'hacking' lib but new version lib without bug wasn't released yet.\n\nSo the conclusion is: new release of 'hacking' lib breaks nova pep8 job. It becomes false positive.\nThe question is \"Why new release of 'hacking' was installed?\"\n\nWe have upper constraints for hacking lib in test-requirements.txt:\n\nhacking<0.11,>=0.10.0\n\nBut we didn't use these constraints for pep8. For pep8 we use only 'hacking' dependency in tox.ini without any constraints.\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/tox.ini#L44\n\nBecause of it we install the latest version of 'hacking' each time.\n\nTo fix it we need to revert this patch https://review.openstack.org/#/c/267097/6",

It's not the best solution because during update of constraint in test-requirements.txt we can forget to update it in tox.ini. But now I don't see a better solution.
