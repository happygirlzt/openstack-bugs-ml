This appears to be how the python logging module works.\n\nhttp://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html\n\nUnder logger.debug they have an example use of 'extra'...and then under it states:\n\n\"If you choose to use these attributes in logged messages, you need to exercise some care. In the above example, for instance, the Formatter has been set up with a format string which expects \u2018clientip\u2019 and \u2018user\u2019 in the attribute dictionary of the LogRecord. If these are missing, the message will not be logged because a string formatting exception will occur. So in this case, you always need to pass the extra dictionary with these keys.\"\n\n:(\n",
