In the case where you have a dedicated nic with no address that is unmanaged by the OS, it will be down at boot and nova-network will not bring it up when enslaving, which makes it non-functional until that happens.\n\nA simple \"ip link set $dev up\" should do it if it's down and be a no-op otherwise.",

Since an interface for this purpose is\n    likely to be left unconfigured by the base OS, expecting it to be\n    up is not ideal.\n    \n    Change-Id: I14564c0bcb55b9dd427ccaa8fb217e38121d4b71\n    Closes-bug: 1228183\n",
