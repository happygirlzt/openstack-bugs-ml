    "description": "When live migrating an instance, it is supposed to retry some (configurable) number of times. It only retries if the host compatibility and migration pre-checks raise nova.exception.Invalid, though:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py#L167-L174\n\nIf, for instance, a destination hypervisor has run out of disk space it will not raise an Invalid subclass, but rather MigrationPreCheckError, which causes the retry loop to short-circuit. Nova should instead retry as long as either Invalid or MigrationPreCheckError is raised.\n\nThis can be tricky to reproduce because it only occurs if a host raises MigrationPreCheckError before a valid host is found, so it's dependent upon the order in which the scheduler supplies possible destinations to the conductor. In theory, though, it can be reproduced by bringing up a number of hypervisors, exhausting the disk on one -- ideally the one that the scheduler will return first -- and then attempting a live migration. It will fail with something like:\n\n$ nova live-migration  --block-migrate stpierre-test-1 ERROR (BadRequest): Migration pre-check error: Unable to migrate f44296dd-ffa6-4ec0-8256-c311d025d46c: Disk of instance is too large(available on destination host:-38654705664 < need:1073741824) (HTTP 400) (Request-ID: req-9951691a-c63c-4888-bec5-30a072dfe727)\n\nEven when there are valid hosts to migrate to.",
