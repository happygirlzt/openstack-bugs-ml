In my understanding, the behavior is reasonable because sharing a keypair means all folks in a project share one private key and it is not a good idea from security perspective. If you need to share a VM, you can add ssh public keys to VM's authorized_key to share a VM.\n\nI mark this bug \"Won't fix\" as Horizon.\nIf you need to discuss this behavior further, please discuss it on ML or add Nova to \"affected projects\".",
