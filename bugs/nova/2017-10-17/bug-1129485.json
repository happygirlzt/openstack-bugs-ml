    "description": "When using the baremetal driver and the default nova scheduler filters, the scheduler will always fail to find a suitable host.\n\nIn order to provision baremetal instances, a separate deploy kernel & ramdisk are used. These may be specified on the flavor (instance_type) extra_specs so that an environment may support different deployment processes (eg, for multiple arch support). However, the ComputeCapabilitiesFilter will not match the instance_type to any compute host that is not publishing all of the same extra_specs, and in the baremetal case, none of the compute hosts publish these deploy_kernel / deploy_ramdisk specs (precisely because they are properties of the flavor, not the compute host).\n\nThe simple workaround for this is to disable the ComputeCapabilitiesFilter, while leaving all other default filters enabled.",

So, that being said, is there anything wrong with requiring deployers to change the scheduler filters for bare metal? If that's acceptable, then this just needs to be documented.\n\nAn alternative might be (if this is even possible) to have the CCF behave slightly differently for different  hypervisor, but I don't feel like changing or writing a new scheduler filter is a good thing to do at this point (iow, until Havana opens).\n\nAny other ideas?",
