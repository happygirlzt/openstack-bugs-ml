This prevents the service status of the host\n    from being updated.\n    \n    This patch handles the case when disable_reason is None.\n    Also, unit tests have been fixed to validate the code path for\n    changing the disabled state of a host.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1623738\n    Change-Id: Ib131f73444234723ef8bbb15bb4bd4a62a83320d\n",
