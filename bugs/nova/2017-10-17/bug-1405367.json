While this is fine for most\n    subclasses, the Rbd subclass overrides this method and\n    so was loosing the QOS settings. Move the setting of\n    QOS parameters into a separate method so it can be\n    called in all places that need it. For added fun the\n    commit 86e6f34 which added QOS settings originally never\n    added any unit tests to cover its operation.\n    \n    Co-authored: Daniel P. Berrange <email address hidden>\n    Fixes bug #1405367\n    Change-Id: Ibb3a4dff8996c29ef921be7c56648a442bbb89a2\n",
