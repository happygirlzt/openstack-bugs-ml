This should be disabled via a flag or a check to see if the backend supports it.  Right now it is very confusing for a user to receive a password back that does not work.",

            "content": "We discussed this on bugsquash day...some observations:\n\n- The create call is asynchronous.  At the time of the call, there\nis no way for the API node to determine whether the backend(s) even\nsupport adminPass, so a check isn't viable.\n\n- if adminPass _is_ specified, it might be ignored depending on the\nhypervisor configurations.\n\n- if adminPass is not specified, a generated one is returned, although\n  it too might be ignored.\n\nThe strawman proposal for a fix is:\n\n1) Add a new bool configuration flag 'enable_instance_password'\n2) Change the API to return an error when a password is passed in, \n   unless the flag is set.\n\nThe intent is to indicate that additional configuration is needed to\nsupport adminPass.  This would affect create, and probably the rebuild\nand change_password calls as well.\n\nThis would be a stopgap until https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/767202\nis fixed.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n, and at\n- Theres no obvious way to indicate the returned password may not be valide\n",
