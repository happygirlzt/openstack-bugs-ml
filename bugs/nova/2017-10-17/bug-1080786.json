When we performed this conversion in Folsom a couple of\n    unused PostgreSQL sequences were left behind.\n    \n    This migration removes the snapshots_id_seq and volumes_id_seq\n    if they exist in the schema when using PostgreSQL.\n    \n    Fixes LP Bug #1080786.\n    \n    Change-Id: I075e2afebcb5236f96ab5d6ab13e249d078da86b\n",
