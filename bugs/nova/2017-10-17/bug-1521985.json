If peradventure a user was working in a setting using the adminURL or the internalURL, the call would still return the publicURL. This issue is not seen upstream because those URLs are all the same in devstack.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- setup the Keystone publicURL as a FQDN\n- do a Nova curl call with the Keystone internalURL or adminURL\n- the Keystone publicURL FQDN is returned instead of the URL used in the call\n\nThe test_get_version_details Tempest test is failing for the same reason in such an environment.\n\nMy understanding is that the publicURL is hardcoded somewhere in the Nova configuration.",

When you would describe much more in detail what the use case looks like you try to implement with using the adminURL or internalURL, then we maybe find a different solution.\n\nPlease set the status back to \"new\" when you provided the requested information.",
