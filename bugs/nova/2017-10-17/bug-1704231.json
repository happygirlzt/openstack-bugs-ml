The actual code/ironic call in in _get_node() mentioned by Ed above, will work for a node UUID or a node string.\n\nHowever, with respect to the ironic driver code in nova, it *only* uses the ironic node UUID, not the ironic node name (since that may not exist for all ironic nodes). The confusion is in the use of 'nodename' vs 'node UUID' in the driver code :-(\n\nI suppose we could change and/or add clarifying documentation where 'nodename' is used in that file.",

In the Ironic driver nodename is\n    often times used because the inherited class uses nodename for method\n    parameters. However the ironic driver doesn't actually use the\n    nodename but uses node_uuid. Driver.py is update by code in some\n    places and documentation in others to try to make it more clear\n    that node_uuid is being used without changing the signature of the\n    methods that are inhereted.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3b69c7d90ed40816e740a2a609c115312fb466ac\n    Closes-Bug: #1704231\n",
