This will\n    allow improvements such as using keystone v3 authentication for the\n    neutron user.\n    \n    DocImpact: Deprecating the existing auth parameters in favour of\n    keystoneclient's session and auth plugin loading parameters.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1424462\n    Change-Id: I7b3b825737dde333c8d88019d814304cbefdbfc7\n",
