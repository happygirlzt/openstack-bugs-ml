Without logs it's hard to be 100% certain, but my supposition is that it's raised when nova tries to push the created snapshot to glance, and glance rejects it because it's qcow2.\n\nThe question then becomes: why is nova creating a qcow2 snapshot image? The reasons would be appear to be either that the existing disk is qcow2 (or was mis-detected as such, see bug 1524274), or that the config variable snapshot_image_format is set to qcow2. Or alternatively some other tortured reason in this organic heap of code.\n\nThis does suggest a solution, though. If you set 'snapshot_image_format' to 'raw' in nova.conf, it should always convert to raw before uploading to glance. If my original supposition is correct, this should fix your problem without any code changes.",

So the whole \"Nova lies to Glance\" family of bugs is known about on their side, and has been worked around already.\n\nUnless, of course, you tell Glance not to accept QCOW2 images for ingest.  Then it does a full-stop and the whole thing flies apart.",
