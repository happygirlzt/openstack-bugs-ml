Berrange <email address hidden>\n      Date:   Thu Jul 24 11:53:47 2014 +0100\n    \n        libvirt: remove 'vif_driver' config parameter\n    \n    The 'volumes_drivers' parameter does the same job as the\n    'vif_driver' parameter, but for volumes instead of vifs.\n    The reasons for deprecating it, in preparation for its\n    removal in Lxxxx are thus the same.\n    \n    The API for the LibvirtBaseVolumeDriver class is not\n    considered to be a public extension point. As such it\n    is not required or expected to remain compatible across\n    releases.\n    \n    The main reason for its existance is for people who are\n    developing new cinder drivers, to be able to write out\n    of tree nova volume drivers. The recommended practice\n    is to instead work in-tree to nova on a branch. This is\n    an approach that would be required in order to submit\n    the work for review and eventual merge in any case.\n    \n    DocImpact: libvirt.volume_drivers config param for\n               nova.conf is deprecated, to be removed in\n               the Lxxxx release\n    Related-bug: #1362191\n    Change-Id: I1f884f36e24fe478922671ca3eaf6b7c21fd8a5a\n",
