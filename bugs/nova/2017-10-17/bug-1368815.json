While the cherrypick seems sane, it's possible that there are subtle interactions with the other delta.  I'd really like for a full qa-regression-test qemu testcase to be run against this package.\n==========================================================\n\n-- Found in releases qemu-2.0.0, qemu-2.0.2, qemu-2.1.0. Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 using Ext4 filesystems.\n\nThe command\n\n\u00a0\u00a0qemu-img convert -O raw inputimage.qcow2 outputimage.raw\n\nintermittently creates corrupted output images, when the input image is not yet fully synchronized to disk. While the issue has actually been discovered in operation of of OpenStack nova, it can be reproduced \"easily\" on command line using\n\n\u00a0\u00a0cat $SRC_PATH > $TMP_PATH && $QEMU_IMG_PATH convert -O raw $TMP_PATH $DST_PATH && cksum $DST_PATH\n\non filesystems exposing this behavior. (The difficult part of this exercise is to prepare a filesystem to reliably trigger this race. On my test machine some filesystems are affected while other aren't, and unfortunately I haven't found the relevant difference between them, yet. Possible it's timing issues completely out of userspace control ...)\n\nThe root cause, however, is the same as in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2011-04/msg00069.html\n\nand it can be solved the same way as suggested in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/coreutils/2011-04/msg00102.html\n\nIn qemu, file block/raw-posix.c use the FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC, i.e change\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0f.fm.fm_flags = 0;\n\nto\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0f.fm.fm_flags = FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC;\n\nAs discussed in the thread mentioned above, retrieving a page cache coherent map of file extents is possible only after fsync on that file.\n\nSee also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1350766\n\nIn that bug report filed against nova, fsync had been suggested to be performed by the framework invoking qemu-img.

By inserting a sleep of at least 33 seconds between the cat command and the qemu-img invocation I'm getting proper output.\n\nTo me it's unclear now, where the actual defect is located. Creating ext4 filesystems with certain features disabled (such as the exetent tree) is apparently supported and ok. Is the fiemap ioctl supposed to handle this gracefully, for example by assuming FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC in absence of an extent tree? Or are clients such as qemu-img supposed to always FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC to be safe?",
