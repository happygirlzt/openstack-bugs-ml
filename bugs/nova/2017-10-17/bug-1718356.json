    "description": "The projects which deploy OpenStack from source or using python wheels currently have to either carry templates for api-paste, policy and rootwrap files or need to source them from git during deployment. This results in some rather complex mechanisms which could be radically simplified by simply ensuring that all the same files are included in the built wheel.\n\nA precedence for this has already been set in neutron [1], glance [2] and designate [3] through the use of the data_files option in the files section of setup.cfg.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/d3c393ff6b5fbd0bdaabc8ba678d755ebfba08f7/setup.cfg#L24-L39\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/02cd5cba70a8465a951cb813a573d390887174b7/setup.cfg#L20-L21\n[3] https://github.com/openstack/designate/blob/25eb143db04554d65efe2e5d60ad3afa6b51d73a/setup.cfg#L30-L37\n\nThis bug will be used for a cross-project implementation of patches to normalise the implementation across the OpenStack projects.
