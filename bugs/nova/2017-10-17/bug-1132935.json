    "description": "The new instance actions feature and API extension are not designed to work with a cells setup.  For example, on a server create:\n\n1. An action is recorded at the global cell level when the request comes in.\n\n2. The request is eventually routed to the cell level scheduler.\n\n3. The scheduler will attempt to look up the action in order to record the schedule event, but because the action was recorded at the global level it will fail to find it and scheduling will error out.\n\nIn the same vein, API requests for a list of actions will query the global db for them, not the cell db.  These requests and responses need to be routed to the child cell and back.",

The event recording fails because it can't find an action to\n    link to.  This patch adds the recording of actions at the child cell\n    level, and changes the API extension to query the db in a child cell for\n    the record of actions and events.\n    \n    This does not address the fact that an action is recorded at the global\n    cell level.\n    \n    Bug 1132935\n    Change-Id: I5831f146397e7afa2d93d26c5d6f9abb9bc6670d\n",
