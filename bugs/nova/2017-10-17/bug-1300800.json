If sysctl read is possible as non-root, please do so. That's what is currently done in Nova and the bug is that the error is handled wrong if executable is not found as dave-mcnally had found. All this could be refactored into a sysctl module so that it would do the right thing depending on the OS and security model.",

I'm personally weakly in favour of A or D since they leave sysctl location up to the sysadmin/distro.  I'm happy to do the patch for any of these, just want to know which choice is likely to be accepted.)",

So I'm abandoning the above change and writing a new change against devstack.\n\nReview comments on https://review.openstack.org/#/c/99820/ for posterity:\n\nSean Dague:\nI feel like we should just force a more extensive path. Or discover once somewhere where sysctl is. Working around path issues on distros seems weird.\n\nRussell Bryant:\nAgree with Sean. I don't think hardcoding the path makes a lot of sense. Perhaps this is something the debian openstack package maintainer can deal with to make sure sysctl is available to the user running nova.\n\nDan Prince:\nIf we follow this pattern here I feel like it might get replicated all over the place. Why not just fix the PATH (outside of nova) in the distro?",
