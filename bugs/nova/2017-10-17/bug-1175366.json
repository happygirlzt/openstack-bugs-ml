    "description": "When the system is under load and a Fibre Channel attach happens with multipath installed, sometimes only 1 devices shows up under multipath -l command.   This causes the detach to fail to detach all of the devices since the libvirt volume code runs multipath -l at attach time, and not all devices show up at that time due to system load and/or FC fabric traffic.\n\nWe need to rediscover all of the devices at detach time and ensure we are removing all of those devices.   The devices should exist at detach time.",
