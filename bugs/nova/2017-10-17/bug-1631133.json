TripleO has always defaulted the\n    workers count to 0 and there was recently a regression in\n    nova where they treat the default of 0 as invalid (a bug\n    that may get fixed in nova but we don't want to wait on it)\n    \n    This patch avoids the issue by allowing the default value\n    to be unset if the TripleO default of 0 is configured.\n    \n    Change-Id: I175977b88129d87caeb32332d47eb14816a6d5d4\n    Closes-bug: #1631133\n",
