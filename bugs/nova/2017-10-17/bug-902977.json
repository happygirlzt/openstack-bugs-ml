This may be referring to the type of the HTTP response.\n\nThe relevant portion of the spec states:\n\"The type parameter will select only base images (BASE) or server backups (SERVER).\"\n\nAttempting to make a request following that rule gives the following empty responses.

I've changed the name of the bug to more accurately reflect the issue.\n",
