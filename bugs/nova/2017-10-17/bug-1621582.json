We could also default use_usb_tablet to False to mimic pointer_model, but that's a change in default behavior without any warning for a release.\n\nWe could also just ignore this and drop use_usb_tablet in Ocata and anyone that was setting it in nova.conf will just not have it picked up and used, but that's annoying for anyone that wants to get ahead of cleaning out deprecation warnings before upgrading to ocata.",

Now operators can use\n    pointer_model=ps2mouse.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id18b5503799922e4096bde296a9e7bb4f2a994aa\n    Closes-Bug: #1621582\n",
