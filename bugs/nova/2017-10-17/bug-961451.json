You are cheating and assuming that the kernel will be called aki-00000001 because it was the first image you uploaded, but IMO this is an invalide assumption. We could work around this by forcing a list and retry on not-found, but IMO this case will never exist in a real deploy, it is only a concern in toy-cloud implementations where you happen to know the order that you ordered images.\n\nI'm marking this won't fix for now.  Feel free to reopen if you disagree.\n",
