This is signaled by the \"supports_device_tagging\" driver capability flag in the code.\n\nThe Xen driver added this capability in the Pike release: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/333781/\n\nSince this is a hypervisor driver specific feature, with it's own capability flag, we should document it in the feature support matrix:\n\nhttps://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/support-matrix.html\n\nIn Pike the ability to attach/detach port interfaces and block devices (volumes) with tags was also added and is a separate capability flag and microversion - we should also have an entry in the feature support matrix entry for that.",
