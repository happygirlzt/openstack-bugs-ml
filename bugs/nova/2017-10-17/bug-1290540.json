The initial patch\n    deprecates name, when that isn't necessary or appropriate - using name\n    based auth is as valid as id based auth - we just need to namespace\n    it in V3.\n    \n    For V3 operators should be able to create:\n    \n    * A service domain\n    * A service/service project\n    * A service/neutron user\n    \n    to replace the prior\n    \n    * service tenant\n    * neutron user\n    \n    structure without switching to ids.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1290540\n    Change-Id: I51837b0dc1bc352c0bf315e383951486b3cac034\n",
