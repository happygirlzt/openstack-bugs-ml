The instance will be launched by this remote volume successfully.\nBut, in such case, we can also use detach api to force this boot device being detached. So, when we do it, the guestOS of this instance would be damaged, and the whole system would not work normally if do a I/O operation. It seems can not resume.\nI think we should give a warning for user at least or even forbiden this operation.",

Although\n    we can argue that it's user response to not detach the root device\n    volume, a check in nova will be more helpful.\n    \n    We can either give a warning message, or not allow it. This patch\n    forbids this operation, considering that even in real system, remove\n    root device does not make much sense.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1279300\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: I01f086be668b35442a2f139f4d7dc96884a3bda6\n    Signed-off-by: Yunhong Jiang <email address hidden>\n",
