The default SSLv3 is no longer considered\n    secure.\n    \n    TLSv1 was chosen over .1 or .2 because the .1 and .2 weren't\n    added until python 2.7.9 so TLSv1 is the only compatible option\n    for py26.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1384487\n    Change-Id: I68bd72fc4d90a102003d9ce48c47a4a6a3dd6e03\n\ncommit 17204e8f02fdad046dabdb8b31397289d72c877b\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 22 06:20:15 2014 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Transifex\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: I58db0476c810aa901463b07c42182eef0adb5114\n\ncommit d712663b99520e6d26269b0ca193527603178742\nAuthor: Carl Baldwin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 20 21:48:42 2014 +0000\n\n    Move disabling of metadata and ipv6_ra to _destroy_router_namespace\n    \n    I noticed that disable_ipv6_ra is called from the wrong place and that\n    in some cases it was called with a bogus router_id because the code\n    made an incorrect assumption about the context.  In other case, it was\n    never called because _destroy_router_namespace was being called\n    directly.  This patch moves the disabling of metadata and ipv6_ra in\n    to _destroy_router_namespace to ensure they get called correctly and\n    avoid duplication.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia76a5ff4200df072b60481f2ee49286b78ece6c4\n    Closes-Bug: #1383495\n\ncommit f82a5117f6f484a649eadff4b0e6be9a5a4d18bb\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Oct 21 12:11:19 2014 +0000\n\n    Updated from global requirements\n    \n    Change-Id: Idcbd730f5c781d21ea75e7bfb15959c8f517980f\n\ncommit be6bd82d43fbcb8d1512d8eb5b7a106332364c31\nAuthor: Angus Lees <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Aug 25 12:14:29 2014 +1000\n\n    Remove duplicate import of constants module\n    \n    .. and enable corresponding pylint check now the only offending instance\n    is fixed.\n    \n    Change-Id: I35a12ace46c872446b8c87d0aacce45e94d71bae\n\ncommit 9902400039018d77aa3034147cfb24ca4b2353f6\nAuthor: rajeev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 13 16:25:36 2014 -0400\n\n    Fix race condition on processing DVR floating IPs\n    \n    Fip namespace and agent gateway port can be shared by multiple dvr routers.\n    This change uses a set as the control variable for these shared resources\n    and ensures that Test and Set operation on the control variable are\n    performed atomically so that race conditions do not occur among\n    multiple threads processing floating IPs.\n    Limitation: The scope of this change is limited to addressing the race\n    condition described in the bug report.

Additionally, it was loading all of\n    the port columns and using none of them. This resulted in a\n    very expensive query with no benefit.\n    \n    This patch eliminates the unnecessary use of the port table by joining\n    the IP allocation table directly to the security groups and allowed\n    address pairs tables. In local testing of the method, this sped it up\n    by an order of magnitude.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1373851\n    Change-Id: I12899413004838d2d22b691f1e2f3b18f7ec2c27\n\ncommit

However, the community did\n    not want to add this library to global requirements, as there was\n    a similar httpretty library available (albeit with some short-\n    comings). As a result, the test module was renamed with a \"no\"\n    prefix, to prevent inclusion in automated tests.\n    \n    Since then, a new library, requests-mock, has been added to global\n    requirements, to replace httpretty, and is being used on several\n    other projects.\n    \n    This commit reworks the unit test to use requests-mock, instead of\n    httmock. The functionality is the same, but the mechanism (a\n    fixture with URI registration vs context manager) is different.\n    \n    This commit provides coverage for the REST client code, by using a\n    mock for the Cisco CSR VM. The unit test module can be subclassed,\n    and used with a real CSR VM, for 3rd party CI testing, in the\n    future.\n    \n    Change-Id: I55c8a253eb32985bc2016ae748b1ded58d021e1a\n    Closes-Bug: 1358470\n\ncommit 1d4e13574574472e299296892d7c9e8f706aea67\nAuthor: Chirag Shahani <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Sep 10 15:47:48 2014 -0700\n\n    Fix to delete user and group association in Nuage Plugin\n    \n    After a router delete operation, the attached zone to that\n    router is also deleted.
