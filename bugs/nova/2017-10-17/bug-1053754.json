A similar patch was suggested there but Vish closed wontfix, saying: \"force_hosts is not a hint meant to be exposed to a user. if you want to force a host as an admin you can use the availability zone syntax\". I haven't tested if that works in stable/Essex. It's now marked as a doc bug as the docs still advise using --hint force_hosts.",
