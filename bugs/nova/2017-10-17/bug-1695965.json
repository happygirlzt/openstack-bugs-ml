The caller needs to parse the output to determine whether or not it was successful.\n\nI think it would make more sense to have the return code as follows:\n\n0 -- no errors and completed\n1 -- one of the migrations raised an exception, needs manual action\n2 -- no errors but not yet complete, need to call again\n\nsince it would allow for an automated retry based solely on the exit code.\n\nAt the very least, the return code should be nonzero for the case where one of the migrations raised an exception, and 0 for the case where no exception was raised.",
