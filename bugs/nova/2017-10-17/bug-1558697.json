However prior to Liberty\n    when preforming a live block migration the compute manager populates\n    disk_info with an encoded JSON string when calling\n    self.driver.get_instance_disk_info. In the live migration case without\n    block migration disk_info is None.\n    \n    As a result we should always decode disk_info when a block migration\n    is called for to ensure that we can iterate over the disks and rebuild\n    the disk.info file.\n    \n    The following change removed the JSON encoding from\n    get_instance_disk_info and other methods within the libvirt driver for\n    Liberty.\n    \n    libvirt: Remove unnecessary JSON conversions\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/177437/6\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1558697\n    Change-Id: Icfe1f23cc3af2d0166dac82109111e341623fc4a\n",
