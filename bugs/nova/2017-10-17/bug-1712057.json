For example:\n1) Set ram_allocation_ratio=2.0 and create vm_1 pass through all filters. if the host1 is selected, then it's host_state.limits['memory_mb'] = host_state.total_usable_ram_mb * ram_allocation_ratio.\n2) Add host1 to aggregate of ag_1 and set ag_1 metadata \"ram_allocation_ratio=2.5\". Then create vm_2 to the host1 not pass through all filters,the memory limits still 2.0*host_state.total_usable_ram_mb, it should be 2.5*host_state.total_usable_ram_mb. when I restart scheduler service, the limits will become None.\n",
