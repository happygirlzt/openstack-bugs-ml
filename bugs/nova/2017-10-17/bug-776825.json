    "description": "When registering an image using the euca commands, things can go wrong if the part files are corrupt or encrypted with the wrong key.  This will cause an uploaded image to stay forever in the decrypting or untarring state.  It would be much more useful if the state was updated to something like \"error decrypting\" when something goes wrong.  This would involve adding a couple of try: excepts: in the delayed_create call in nova/image/s3.py",
