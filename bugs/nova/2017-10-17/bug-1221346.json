This prevents the use of unicode values. A previous\n    patch errantly updated the utility function without bumping all\n    of the affected objects' versions. This does that, and also\n    fixes the issue for bare str() attributes.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iad83589d399309b95c32813a1a660a12e571066b\n    Closes-bug: 1221346\n",
