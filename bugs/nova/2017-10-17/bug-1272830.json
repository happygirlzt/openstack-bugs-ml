Several Nova methods which use that\n    decorator also have code for returning early (ie no-op)\n    if the interval is 0.  This is inconsistent for users, and\n    means there is timing-related code where it doesn't belong.\n    \n    This patch adds a warning when a user takes a value of 0\n    from config and uses it as an interval in a @periodic_task.\n    \n    Ideally all code will use Oslo's convention that 0 means\n    run at the default rate and a negative interval will mean\n    \"don't run\".  After this warning has been in place for a full\n    release cycle that can be the case.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia227f4c4e69ecf361ab02d1d17a3010303650104\n    DocImpact: Warns of upcoming change to behaviour when\n               *_interval is set to 0\n    Closes-Bug: #1272830\n    Partial-Bug: #1276203\n",
