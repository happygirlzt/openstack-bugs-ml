If nova-compute isn't installed that file won't exist.  The error won't actually stop anything from working, but it is annoying to see it pop up\n\nNot sure about the best solution here, should nova-common install an empty nova-compute.conf that can be overwritten by the nova-compute package selected?  Should nova-compute append --flagfile=nova.compute.conf to nova.conf when it is installed? Should we find a way to supress the error message in nova?",

If you only need nova-compute.conf for the compute service, then my first suggestion should work. Otherwise, nova-compute.conf needs to always exist no?",
