It prevents users deploying Nova on unsupported\n    hypervisor platforms with older versions of qemu/kvm.\n    This check defines the min versions required to spawn instances.\n    It is an extension of I2851624a8cdaf353df3386e1e3e3cc0e35af41ec.\n    ppc* support was added in 2.1:\n    https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/utopic/+source/qemu/+changelog\n    \n    Change-Id: I3619cd619a2d7d9d3f1c1eb30108a2d881ee8ca4\n    Closes-Bug: #1498653\n",
