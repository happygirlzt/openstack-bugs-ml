If user is not able to delete the instance\nusing command [1], then only he/she will try to force-delete it using command [2].\n\nIMO the sole purpose of 'force-delete' is to delete an instance if it gets stuck in unrecoverable state.\n\nIn current bug, instance gets stuck in deleting task_state and since user can't reset the instance state, there is no way\nuser can delete that instance.\nThe proposed patch has a side effect, if user tries to force-delete the same instance multiple times. In that case,\nnova-api server will be sending lots of rabbit messages to compute node to force-delete single instance.\n\nCan we add new task_state 'force_deleting' which is set if instance is deleted using force-delete command [2] ?\nIf yes, we can add a check to reject subsequent force-delete requests.\n\n[1] $ nova delete <instance_id>\n[2] $ nova force-delete <instance_id>\n\nPlease give your opinion for the same.",

Now since the instance task_state is already in 'force-deleting' state and if at that moment rabbitmq-server get crashed by some reasons, then the instance task_state remain 'force-deleting' forever and instance will not be deleted.\n\nNow after rabbitmq-server is up and user request for instance deletion using force-delete or delete api, it will raise InstanceInvalidState Exception and user won't be able to delete that instance ever without restarting nova-compute service.",
