In this case the API\n    should pass the image properties to the new instance so it can get some\n    important parameters that it might specify.\n    \n    After adding the new BDMv2 API in 13180f76, we introduced a mistake in\n    the method that gets the image properties (from the boot BDM) if no\n    image_ref is defined. When the source is an image it will return the\n    whole image metadata instead of getting just the properties. This\n    causes that when the source image is an AMI the instance won't have the\n    ramdisk and kernel properties set and will fail to boot.\n    \n    This patch fixes the image properties when booting from a volume created\n    from an image.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1220318\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibcd60510cc909fcaa0d6d4769f91c070dfaf22ff\n",
