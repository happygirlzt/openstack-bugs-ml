    "description": "I've been doing a little work with Nova and Ceph. As part of this work I've been testing snapshots. I've discovered that RBDDriver does not implement create_volume_from_snapshot(). Attempts to create volumes from snapshots instead fall through to VolumeDriver's LVM-based implementation and then fail.\n\nAttached is a patch against essex that implements this functionality. I have tested it lightly with a Ceph cluster running 0.48, the stable \"argonaut\" release. (Lightly = successfully created a volume from a snapshot, and then removed it.)",
