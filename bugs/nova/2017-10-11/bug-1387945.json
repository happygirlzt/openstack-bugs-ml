The volumes are going to get attached to the next available drive mapping (vdb, vdc, vdd) based on the Block Device Mapping table in Nova.  The specification you provide to attach-volume is really more of a hint than anything else.\n\nAnyway, over the past the answer has been \"just use 'auto'\" and save yourself the false sense of control here.  Not acceptable for some, regardless this is a Nova operation and Cinder actually has no control or input here.  \n\nMarking invalid for Cinder and adding Nova.",

The dev attribute indicates the \"logical\" device name. The actual device name specified is not guaranteed to map to the device name in the guest OS. Treat it as a device ordering hint. The optional bus attribute specifies the type of disk device to emulate; possible values are driver specific, with typical values being \"ide\", \"scsi\", \"virtio\", \"xen\", \"usb\", \"sata\", or \"sd\" \"sd\" since 1.1.2. If omitted, the bus type is inferred from the style of the device name (e.g. a device named 'sda' will typically be exported using a SCSI bus). The optional attribute tray indicates the tray status of the removable disks (i.e. CDROM or Floppy disk), the value can be either \"open\" or \"closed\", defaults to \"closed\". NB, the value of tray could be updated while the domain is running. The optional attribute removable sets the removable flag for USB disks, and its value can be either \"on\" or \"off\", defaulting to \"off\".
