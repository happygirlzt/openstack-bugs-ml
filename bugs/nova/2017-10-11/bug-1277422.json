Instead it incorrectly use values from the new flavor.\n\nThis was originally reported and fixed in bug 1099729 but has since resurfaced with the move to objects (commit  dce64683291ba2cdb5e6617e01ccc2909254acb4). This was made possible by a prior change (commit a56f0b33069b919ebb24c4afdcc6b6c31592c98e) that accidentally removed the test put in place to guard against this error ever happening again.",
