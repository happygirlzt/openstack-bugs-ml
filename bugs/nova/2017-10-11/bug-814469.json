Of course it won't boot and become what we usually consider a useful virtual machine, but I can't think of a sane way to determine whether it's \"active\". We try to boot the virtual machine and the CPU will certainly execute the \"machine code\" its fed, just like a \"real\" virtual machine would. \n\nWe can make some educated guesses (check for DHCP requests), but they're only guesses. Maybe you intentionally disabled or delayed DHCP. I can't imagine why, but who am I to judge? :)",
