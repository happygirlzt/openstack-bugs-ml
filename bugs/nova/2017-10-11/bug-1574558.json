Then qemu will boot with boot loader and boot loader variable.\n    \n    Nova will specify boot loader to template attribute in nvram element\n    instead of specify boot loader variable. This will cause RAM execute\n    failed at qemu process.\n    \n    Qemu config have variable named nvram which save location of master\n    nvram file. Therefore we didn't need to assign variable store file, just\n    let libvirt process to find relative variable store file with OVMF code file.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib589507967742334ad93c6a68de4ee8d3bb42eec\n    Closes-Bug: #1574558\n",
