The patch is simple e.g.\n\n      try:\n          consumer = CONSUMERS[topic][0]\n      except (KeyError, IndexError):\n -        return iter([None])\n +        raise rpc_common.Timeout()\n\nbut Nova's unit tests break massively with this change, so they'd need to be fixed first\n\nThe oslo.messaging fake driver already does the right thing.",
