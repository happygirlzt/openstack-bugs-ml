    "description": "If you are connected to a VNC or Spice console during the boot process of a VM which uses an AMI image, you will see no output.  This is because Nova passes only console=ttyS0 to the kernel, which makes the console log work but disables virtual terminal output.  Instead, Nova should pass two arguments:\n\nconsole=ttyS0 console=tty0\n\nDoing so is supported and confirmed to work, per the kernel docs:\nhttp://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-Serial-Console-HOWTO/configure-kernel.html",
