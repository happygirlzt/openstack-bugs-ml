You'll notice comments in the doc sources like \"needs:parameter_verification\" or \"needs:example_verification\" [2]. As long as these comments are in the doc sources, they aren't yet checked for validity but will be targeted soon. \n\nAs the effort will be driven by the blueprint, I'm closing this bug report. If you find such issues after the blueprint [1] is marked as implemented, feel free to open such bug reports again. \n\nIn the meantime, new contributors which like to work on improving those doc sources are *highly* welcome. You can ping alex_xu, oomichi, sdague or auggy in the #openstack-nova IRC channel for that [3]. More information can be found at [4].\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/api-ref-in-rst\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/850d8cdc2cb8163285bdacd1ea83b4fe145e8d16/api-ref/source/servers-action-fixed-ip.inc#L2\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova/Mentoring\n[4] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/NovaAPIRef",
