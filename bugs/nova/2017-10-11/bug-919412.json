    "description": "When an instance fails to get an IP address (due to out of IPs, etc), the vif is left around with a network_id of None.  This causes exceptions when trying to delete the instance in the following methods:\n\nbuild_network_info_model() and get_instance_nw_info() in the network manager.\n\nBoth have the following code:\n\nfor vif in vifs:\n    network = self._get_network_by_id(context, vif['network_id'])\n \nThat'll end up raising because we try to get a network of id 'None' out of the DB, and there is no such network.\n\nSo far, I patched both to do:\n    if not vif['network_id']:\n        continue\n\nbefore the _get_network_by_id() call.\n\nThis also required a fix in fake_network where it was setting up fakes with ids of 0.  That fix is here:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/4460/\n\nI'm not positive the 'continue' code I added is appropriate... but I know the above paste is a fix we'll need to make.",
