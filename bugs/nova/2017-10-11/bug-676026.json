    "description": "When log rotation is setup for /var/log/nova the Nova services will not log to the new file after log rotation occurs. \n\nFor instance, you have Nova-Compute running and it is logging to /var/log/nova/nova-compute.log, log rotation occurs and moves the file to nova-compute.log.1 and creates a new file named nova-compute.log. Nova-Compute continues to log in the nova-compute.log.1 file (I have seen this as deep as 4 rotations, so nova-compute.log.4) leaving the nova-compute.log file empty. Stopping and starting the service makes it start logging to the proper file again.\n\nThis occurs with all of the Nova services.",

            "content": "I actually just finally looked into this issue myself because another symptom of this bug is that you end up with a bazillion log files after a few weeks.  Here's my understanding of the issue:\n\n- Nova's logging does not support log rotation, because it currently opens the logfile at launch and holds that one filehandle for the duration of the daemon's existence.  When logrotate runs, the file descriptor changes but nova never finds out.  One way to deal with this would be to allow nova daemons to reopen the logfile file handle when it receives a SIGHUP.  See nova/server.py for the logging setup.\n\n- The logrotate script is included with Soren's ppa-lucid branch and is not part of trunk.  I assume it was an afterthought, because the configuration simply tells logrotate to rotate *every* file in the /var/log/nova directory.  So even the rotated logs get rotated.\n\n- There is one possible workaround: If you don't include the --logfile flag but set --use_syslog=1 then the nova daemon will log to syslog, so logrotate should work OK.  \n\n",
