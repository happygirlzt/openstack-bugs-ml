As keypairs aren't part of the Cloud Servers API specs (v1.0/v1.1) we need to make this requirement optional.\n\nNOTE: Additionally there is currently no Openstack API controller to create keypairs. (branches exist to add this functionality however)\n\nSee: https://code.launchpad.net/~justin-fathomdb/nova/justinsb-openstack-api-keys",

Ideally, they'd upload their own public key, but we know that not every user will do that.",

Once that is in (hopefully early this week) we can resolve this issue as well fairly quickly.\n\nI've been holding off on doing this until he gets his branch in to avoid any further conflicts in that same file.",

It was a 15 minute fix (mostly spent waiting for bazaar and launchpad)  This was blocking me from doing testing, so it became 'next on my list' for me.\n\nGoing to propose for merge in a few minutes:\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~justin-fathomdb/nova/bug732204/+merge/53359\n\nI guess in future if you're working on something then grab it....\n\nI'm going to grab it back so that this doesn't confuse people.",
