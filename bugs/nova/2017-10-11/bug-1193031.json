    "description": "When amqp_rpc_single_reply_queue=True is set, using qpid on Fedora 17 novn service will fail to work reliably.\n\nReproduce by starting more then one instance, and then get theit vnc consoles with:\n\n$ nova get-vnc-consol $INSTANCE_UUID_1 novnc\n$ nova get-vnc-consol $INSTANCE_UUID_2 novnc\n\nAnd try to connect to those consoles in your browser, to use them, and refresh the page. The page will eventually get stuck on 'Waiting for VNC handshake' and generaly not work properly.\n\nI dug a bit deeper into this and it seems to be realted to a select call in wbesockify.py which does not work properly with eventlet monkey_patched sockets.\n\nThe solution is to either not monkey_patch for /cmd/nova-novncproxy and do the rpc call that validates the token with the consolauth service in a separate process that is monkey_patched (the rpc won't work without it), or to make openstack/common/rpc/amqp/multicall not use green-threads for this particular call (ie. block the caller).\n\nConfirmed with trunk on 75ead3a2a37efbc6a4fdea7e492ca41cdd559a8c (20-6-2013)",

The issue doesn't happen if we force to use \"poll\" hub in the websocketproxy module or just monkey_patch inside the new_client method (as this is run in a separate process) :\n\nwebsockify uses 'select' directly to decide when to write/read to a socket and multiprocessing to spawn the processes that will take care of the client. This makes me think that eventlet's epoll implementation is broken if used together with multiprocessing.\n\nI'll update if I find something else while following the trail into eventlet's internals.",
