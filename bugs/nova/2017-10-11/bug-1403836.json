If the portal is CHAP authenticated, we shall not be able to attach the target to the host (I did confirm this  running on wbemtest as well). I had Microsft Windows Server 2012 R2.\n\nThanks & Regards,\nBharath",

This will let us use backends that require\n      discovery credentials (which may be different than the\n      credentials used when logging in targets)\n    * improved MPIO support (the caller must request logging in the\n      target for each of the available portals. Logging in multiple\n      targets exporting the same LUN is also supported). Also, a\n      specific initiator can be requested when creating sessions.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1403836\n    Closes-Bug: #1372823\n    Closes-Bug: #1372827\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Alin Balutoiu <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: Ie037cf1712a28e85e5eca445eea3df883c6b6831\n",
