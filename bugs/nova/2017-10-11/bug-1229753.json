This patch fixes the most recent issues found.\n    \n    For the H304 relative import errors, we have to skip those because they\n    are put into /etc/xensource/scripts which is the current working\n    directory when running the plugin.\n    \n    For the H231 incompatible python 3 'except x,y' construct, we have to\n    skip those because this code is written to run on python 2.4 and 'except\n    x as y' does not work with python 2.4.\n    \n    Note that in cleaning up some of the H304 failures for relative imports,\n    I also re-arranged the imports to follow the hacking guide of doing\n    standard library packages first, then third party packages, and finally\n    nova-specific packages.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1229753\n    \n    Change-Id: I1c2211fd6a10d43d7e65cdb4e18530397788cf2c\n",
