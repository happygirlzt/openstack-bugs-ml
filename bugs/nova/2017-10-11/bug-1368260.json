Another issue is that the compute node would need multiple DB accesses to get the PCI requests, while if they are part of the instances, they can become available together with the instance.",

This\n    is achieved by adding pci_requests into the instance dict before\n    calling consume_from_instance() and deleting it afterwards. The\n    complete solution will be provided when bug 1368260 is fully\n    addressed. The patch also removes the unnecessary context argument.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib0d12cde1c297a04e5d626b28d0a994c5dd4d965\n    Partial-Bug: 1368260\n",

This finishes that work so that it\n    behaves properly and doesn't require an additional DB lookup every time we need to\n    pull it based on an instance.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1368260\n    Change-Id: I134441c8288d5dbdc0bac6163cb2affc9f0af762\n",
