This patch is pinning\n    the API version for Ironic at 1.8 so the nova driver can benefit from\n    this feature by fetching only the required fields for the deployment,\n    making it more lightweight and improving the readability of the logs.\n    \n    The configuration option \"api_version\" was marked as deprecated and\n    should be removed in the future. The only possible value for that\n    configuration was \"1\" (because Ironic only have 1 API version) and the\n    ironic team came to an agreement that setting the API version via\n    configuration option should not be supported anymore.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1458934\n    Change-Id: Iebfa06da6811889e11fd4edf15d47ca4e0feea6f\n",
