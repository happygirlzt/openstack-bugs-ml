    "description": "Volume snapshots in EC2 can be created only for volumes in some particular statuses. For other statuses creation an error should be returned. Current EC2 code doesn't check the statuses and pass the request to Cinder code. When it fails creating it returns its own native error which is incorrectly reported further by EC2 layer.\n\nEnvironment: DevStack\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1 Run from script:\nvol=$(euca-create-volume -z nova -s 1 --snapshot snap-xxx | awk -F \" \" '{print $2}')\neuca-create-snapshot $vol\n\nInvalidInput: Invalid input received: Invalid volume: must be available\n\nIf run tthis agains AWS the error output is\nIncorrectState: Volume 'vol-xxx' is not in a state where snapshots are allowed.\n\nNote. To reproduce the error on AWS i recommend to get a non-empty snapshot about 10GB and increase the size parameter in euca-create-volume.",
