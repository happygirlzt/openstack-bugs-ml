A timeout? Do you have any logs?\n\nThere are a large number of configuration options that deal with live migration. Perhaps most importantly 'live_migration_completion_timeout' and 'live_migration_progress_timout' declare the maximum time to wait for a live migration before the operation is aborted.",
