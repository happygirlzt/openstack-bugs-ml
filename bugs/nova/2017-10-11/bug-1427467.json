In that fix, we use the\n    \"config_drive_cdrom\" value from the conf to determine if a\n    there is a iso configdrive attached to the instance. This\n    approach is wrong due to the fact that that config value can be\n    modified by the user. If that happens, instances that still have\n    iso configdrives will be ommitted.\n    \n    This path fixes this problem by checking the instance itself if\n    it has any iso attached to it.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1427467\n    Change-Id: Ia64389b4405109d7db6fbf9c000a0136e9862298\n",
