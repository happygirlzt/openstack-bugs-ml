Even if the code has changed a lot since the original pre-Essex code released by Cloud.com it's absolutely correct to include the copyright notice in the new files.\n\nIt's anyway very interesting how, by looking at the following Cloudstack blueprint which provides a Hyper-V driver, I found our OpenStack Python code included in the implementation (keeping the correct copyright notices), with a Java wrapper on top:\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Hyper-V+2012+%283.0%29+Support\n\nHere's the relevant implementation:\n\nhttps://github.com/lafferty/cshv3/tree/master/plugins/hypervisors/hyperv/scripts/hyperv\n \nSo if this will be merged, Cloudstack will be in part an OpenStack derivative :-)\n\n\nAgain, I'm very sorry sorry for my inadvertence, I'm going to add the copyright notice right away.\n  ",

There are less files involved and a better chance of getting it donated by Cloud.com\n\nUnfortunately, the Apache folks don't like 3rd party code, as I'm finding out.  It is unlikely that OpenStack code will find its way into CloudStack :(\n\nIn the meantime, keep up the good work!",
