This patch changes the default policy to\n    from ANY to ADMIN_OR_OWNER.\n    \n    This patch doesn't address the actual policy check at the API level.\n    This would be fixed as part of a wider effort. For now, we maintain\n    consistency with other similar APIs.\n    \n    Change-Id: If5f48fad9f040dd08060b4a86858a3b223550956\n    Closes-Bug: #1581203\n",
