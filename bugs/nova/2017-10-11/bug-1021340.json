    "description": "During compute/terminate_instance networking is de-allocated by a call to network/api/deallocate_for_instance(), which is implemented as an rpc.cast to the network manager.   This in turn will eventually call  network/manager/deallocate_fixed_ip(), which in turn call the compute API to trigger a security group refresh, which will get the instance from the database \n\nHowever because original call to the network manager is a cast there is a chance that the compute manager will delete the instance record in the DB before the compute API (in the network manager) tries to retrieve the instance.   At this point the security group refresh fails (leaving rules in place which are a security risk when the IP is reused), and potentially stopping other aspects of the network deallocation from completing.\n\nThis is one of the few places left in the network api where a cast is used, and it seems to me that an rpc.call would be better \u2013 the compute manager really needs to know that the network has been properly deallocated and cleaned up before it marks the VM as deleted.   \n\nIn addition to this race condition, in general if there is an error during network clean up it is better that the VM remains in an error condition so that delete can be retried than for the VM to be deleted with the network left in some indeterminate state with no trigger available to retry the clean up.  Hence some exception handling for the call to deallocate_for_instance() is required.\n\n\n\nNote that aside from this specific use of a cast there are 4 other casts in the network API:\n  add_fixed_ip_to_instance\n  remove_fixed_ip_from_instance\n  add_network_to_project\n  release_floating_ip\n\nMaybe these should all be considered for conversion to rpc.call to avoid race conditions and inconsistencies between the compute and network manager.",
