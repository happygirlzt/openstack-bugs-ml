This patch removes that possibility so that we don't let anything\n    creep into the RPC-affecting API that would be unrestricted.\n    \n    The change that introduced this was I7848f8b934c169a76b1cfd875f7905273f9f914b\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1441243\n    Change-Id: Ia33994402cca5b4569d72860ab5da675134f5a95\n",
