The datastore could\n    be in an inaccessible state. In such cases creating an instance to\n    such datastore will fail. The fix to filter out inaccessible data-\n    stores.\n    \n    The datastores have a property called accessible. The fix is to use\n    this property to filter out inaccessible datastores.\n    \n    fix bug #1194078\n    \n    Change-Id: I372fc3adc0e89c48d86f1f70164263ed35184c5d\n",
