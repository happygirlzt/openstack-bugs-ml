This functionality is available in openstackclient and could be \"backported\", though I think development of \"novaclient\" has all but stopped at this point. Making as \"invalid\" until someone disagrees with this opinion :)",

            "content": "I think the bug is valid, just badly titled. \nThe point in the description is probably the more important one - \"nova quota-update should either reject tenant_ids which don't match a valid uuid\".\n\nSo at the moment you can update the quota of a tenant that doesn't exist. So if there's an error when the user types in the tenant id, and he types in a tenant-id that doesn't exist, the command runs ok, and the user is none the wiser that the intended tenant has not been updated. \n\nYou can also do a nova quota-show on a tenant-id that doesn't exist and get returned the default quota. Again you would expect to get a \"tenant not found\" or similar error, not something that looks like a successful completion of an invalid request.\n",
