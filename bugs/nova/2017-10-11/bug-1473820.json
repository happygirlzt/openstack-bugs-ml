I'll recommend to read [3] if not yet done. To focus here \non bugs which are a failures/errors/faults I close this one as \"Invalid\".\nThe effort to implement the requested feature is then driven only by\nthe blueprint (and spec).\n\nIf there are any questions left, feel free to contact me (markus_z) \nin the IRC channel #openstack-nova \n\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
