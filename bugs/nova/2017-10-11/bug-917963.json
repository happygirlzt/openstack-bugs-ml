    "description": "Ajaxterm (by way of qweb [last patched in 2006]) stores session data in a pickle in the system temp directory. It unpickles this file without validation. If an attacker can write to the temp directory (file upload would be a common case, qweb may allow this), qweb will happily unpickle and execute attack code.\n\nThe qweb framework has a bunch of other problems (irresponsible use of eval on user provided input, response splitting and various XSS shenanigans being obvious candidates), but this one seems particularly notable. I would suggest that we fix the bug by removing qweb.py (and by extension, ajaxterm) rather than trying to patch its deficiencies. \n\nWe have noVNC, which obsoletes ajaxterm pretty effectively.",
