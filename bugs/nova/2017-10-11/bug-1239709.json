    "description": "The base object infrastructure has been comparing Object.version instead of the Object.VERSION that *all* the objects have been setting and incrementing when changes have been made. Since the base object defined a .version, and that was used to determine the actual version of an object, all objects defining a different VERSION were ignored.\n\nAll systems in the wild currently running broken code are sending version '1.0' for all of their objects. The fix is to change the base object infrastructure to properly examine, compare and send Object.VERSION.\n\nImpact should be minimal at this point, but getting systems patched as soon as possible will be important going forward.",
