The\n    impetus of the patch was a XenServer specific issue bug #911366, where deleted\n    instances would remain running on the host machine.\n    \n    The patch however is hypervisor agnostic and is generally useful as a\n    housekeeping task to make sure these 'zombied' instances are detected.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iddc6a88920a537a3a115f8b9bc0039ec0e24a194\n",
