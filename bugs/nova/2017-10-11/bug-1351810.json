It should\n    be moved to a more general location so others could utilize it\n    and allow it to be properly unit tested. The following patch\n    moves _is_mapping to nova/virt/block_device.py and renames it\n    to is_block_device_mapping.\n    \n    Change-Id: I560abc4b57ca5bd195282af7cd1ab9bbf7600b67\n    Closes-Bug: #1351810\n",
