    "description": "Note: the reproduction case below has been fixed by not blocking migration on config drives.  However, the underlying issue of NFS not being marked\nas shared storage still stands, since the 'is_shared_block_storage' data\nis used elsewhere as well.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1. Set up shared instance storage via NFS and use one of the file-based image backends\n2. Boot an instance with a config drive\n3. Attempt to live migrate said instance w/o doing a block migration\n\nThe issue is caused by the following lines in nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if not (is_shared_instance_path and is_shared_block_storage):\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# NOTE(mikal): live migration of instances using config drive is\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# not supported because of a bug in libvirt (read only devices\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0# are not copied by libvirt).

The issue is that if a deployer is not using Ceph, the call to self.image_backend.backend().is_shared_block_storage() returns False.  However, is_shared_block_storage should not even be considered if the image backend is a file-based one.",
