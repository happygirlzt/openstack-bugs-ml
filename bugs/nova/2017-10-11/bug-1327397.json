For this goal\n    intended number of base test cases which used in current implementation.\n    Previously there were two ways to run migration tests: using\n    opportunistic test cases (default way we've been using on CI) and\n    by using database connection strings, specified in test_migrations.conf,\n    for every particular database test case. For the sake of simplicity and\n    consistency we are moving to using of opportunistic db test cases here.\n    \n    With this change we are free from locking, so we don't need `lockfile`\n    anymore.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1327397\n    Closes-Bug: #1328997\n    Change-Id: I92b1dcd830c4755f429a0f6529911e607c2c7de7\n",

The main feature of this\n    approach is - for each migration test will be created new database\n    with random name. This will avoid migration tests of race conditions\n    and reduce tests intersection.\n    \n    ``test_migrations.conf`` file was removed, because we create test\n    database for migration test, so we no longer need test database credentials.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1327397\n    Closes-Bug: #1328997\n    \n    Change-Id: I95ad140ba5f483cd3dc36e2b78f140826d57624f\n",
