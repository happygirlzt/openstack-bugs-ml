Unfortunately the blame lies with me as this fix got merged first...\n\nLooking through the nova/neutron API unit tests, I found test_get_instance_nw_info_ignores_neutron_ports, which suggests that _build_network_info_model should ignore any Neutron ports it finds that aren't in the instance info cache. Unfortunately, this test case only covers the case where there is already an interface in the cache, so it did not fire when this change went in.\n\nI believe that the fix for bug #1467581 will solve this issue because it refreshes the instance info cache from the DB before writing it back, whilst holding the refresh-cache lock. This means that although the external event may initially get an empty info cache from the DB, it will be updated later on with the correct value.\n\nCould those who worked on this bug originally please take a look through those two other bug reports and offer their opinions?",
