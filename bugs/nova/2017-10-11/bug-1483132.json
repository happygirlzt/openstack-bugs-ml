(DER is a strict subset of BER, so anything that can read BER can read DER, but not necessarily the other way around.)\n\nSome third-party tools only support DER and this has created at least one issue [3] (specifically because Go's standard library only supports DER).\n\nI have provided Paramiko with a small change that makes its SSH private key output equal to OpenSSH's ssh-keygen output (and presumably DER formatted) [4].\n\nProviding a change to Paramiko is just one method of addressing this backwards-incompatibility and interoperability issue.  Should the Paramiko change be accepted the unit test output vectors will need to be changed, but should it not, is a reversion of or modification to Nova acceptable to maintain backwards-compatibility and interoperability?\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/157931\n[2] http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/commit/?id=3f3f9bf22efd2fb209d2a2fe0246f4857cd2d21a\n[3] https://github.com/mitchellh/packer/issues/2526\n[4] https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/572",

This work-around\n    entails implementing Paramiko internals (ie how to generate a key) in\n    Nova in a way compatible with both PyCrypto and PyCryptodom.\n    \n    This work-around is itself a source of failure with Paramiko 2 which\n    has replaced the PyCrypto requirement with the cryptography Python\n    package.  As Paramiko no longer depends on PyCrypto, Nova doesn't have\n    an explicit PyCrypto requirement, and there's no implicit dependency\n    on PyCrypto, when Nova tries to import PyCrypto it fails.  Even if\n    PyCrypto was installed, the work-around would still fail because the\n    Paramiko interface that Nova is using as part of the work-around\n    changed with the major version change (ie 1.x => 2.x).\n    \n    Change-Id: I5d6543e690a3b4495476027fd8a4894ff8c42bf6\n    Related-Bug: #1483132\n",
