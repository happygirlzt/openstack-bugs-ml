But on calling \"resize-confirm\", confirm_resize() will try to delete both the metadata with prefix 'old_' and 'new_ '. Then user will run into exception which said: \"KeyError: 'old_instance_type_memory_mb'\"\n\nSo I'm going to submit a fix to make sure the metadata with prefix \"old_\" will be savid in _finish_resize() to avoid the exception.",

That assumption failed when a regular migration\n    went to delete the old_ stashed instance types from system_metadata.\n    \n    This unifies the cleanup logic, which only gets performed if we're actually\n    doing a resize.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1136768\n    \n    Change-Id: I0796864b044fc746583164e4a684f79dc431c137\n",
