This patch corrects this issue. This was discovered\n    while adding logic to determine if the network_cache needs to be updated.\n    While updating the __eq__ operator to check all of the objects fields\n    rather than just id there tests started failing.\n    \n    Closes-bug: # 1260891\n    Related to blueprint: smarter-network-cache-update\n    \n    Change-Id: I6d144aecf95725146aa0fc4f4fe5a3f16c434d14\n",
