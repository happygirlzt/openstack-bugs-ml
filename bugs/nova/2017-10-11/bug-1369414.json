It is useful if your\n    server has been shut down, and then restarted right away while sockets are\n    still active on its port.\n    \n    socket.SO_KEEPALIVE:\n    To confirm that an idle connection is still active, these implementations\n    send a probe segment designed to elicit a response from the peer TCP. The the\n    probe causes the receiver to return an acknowledgement segment, confirming\n    that the connection is still live. If the peer has dropped the connection due\n    to a network partition or a crash, it will respond with a RST instead of an\n    acknowledgement segment.\n    \n    socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE:\n    It is useful to set this socket option, because if the other peers lose their\n    connection (for example by rebooting) you will notice that the connection is\n    broken, even if you don't have traffic on it. If the probes are not replied\n    to by your peer, you can assert that the connection cannot be considered valid\n    and then take the correct action.\n    \n    IMO, these options are useful in both the cases, whether SSL is enabled or not.\n    \n    Made provision to set socket.SO_REUSEADDR, socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE and\n    socket.SO_KEEPALIVE socket options if SSL is enabled or not.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1369414\n    \n    Change-Id: I25b353dcf1ca6eba1c54d297994d56c0064daca5\n",
