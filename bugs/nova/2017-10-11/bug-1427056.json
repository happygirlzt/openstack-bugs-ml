Call unshelve instance.\n\n   For shelved_offload_time >= 0:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.1 nova-conductor calls RPC.Cast to nova-compute\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If some failure happens in nova-compute. e.g. \"Instance failed to spawn\" error      from libvirt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.2 nova-conductor deletes instance_system_metadata.shelved_image_id after RPC.cast for unshelving the instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.3 Instance becomes SHELVED_OFFLOADED again by revert_task_state, but instance_system_metadata.shelved_image_id is already deleted for this instance\n\nFor shelved_offload_time = -1:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.1 nova-conductor calls RPC.Cast to nova-compute\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If some failure happens in nova-compute. e.g. \"InstanceNotFound\" error while starting the instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.2 nova-conductor deletes snapshot and instance_system_metadata.shelved_image_id after RPC.cast to start the instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.3 Instance becomes SHELVED again by revert_task_state, but snapshot and  instance_system_metadata.shelved_image_id is already deleted for this instance\n\nProblems:\n1. As there is no shelved_image_id, during unshelving the instance again, it gives error while getting image-meta in\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0libvirt driver and instance remains in SHELVED_OFFLOADED state.\n\n2.
