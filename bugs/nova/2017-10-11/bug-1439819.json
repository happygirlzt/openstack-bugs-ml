But Nova\n    stores these properties into system metadata of an instance booted from\n    the volume and into properties of snapshot image of the instance. This\n    leads to consuming of waste DB space, increases traffic with DB, and\n    confuses end users by unexpected image properties of instnace snapshot.\n    \n    The reason is that Cinder stores image attributes (id, name, checksum,\n    etc) as volume image metadata together with true image metadata. Then\n    Nova loads this metadata and uses it as properties of image metadata as\n    is, with no modification.\n    \n    This patch removes this artifical properties from loaded volume image\n    metadata.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1439819\n    Change-Id: Ic1155449aa47170ffd4e6e87e50de0a4cb5732da\n",

But that sources could be\n    changed since the instance was booted.\n    \n    To make instance snapshots independent of source changes this patch\n    collects metadata from instance system metadata rather than the sources.\n    \n    Since it brings the only way to initialize image metadata, it fixes:\n    a) min_ram attribute is not inherited from a bootable volume\n    (LP #1369854).\n    b) empty container_format and disk_format attribute are inherited from a\n    source instance snapshot (LP #1439819).\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1369854\n    Closes-Bug: #1439819\n    Related-Bug: #1469179\n    Change-Id: I067f66356a5ebd738add1591a0069d8049f35c24\n",
