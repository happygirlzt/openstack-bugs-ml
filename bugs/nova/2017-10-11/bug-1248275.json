The patch i submitted above. (chmod +r /etc/guest_info) in the guest upstart script\n2. Set the variable to false in the rc file for devstack. \n3. Push up a bug to nova that the file permissions change between injecting files with config drive on or off.\n\n#3 seems to be the most logical unless there is push back that this is by design.\nOtherwise i think we should probably accept my patch since we want to work with vanilla devstack install.",
