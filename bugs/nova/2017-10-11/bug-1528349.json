That method needs converting to use Nova's  nova.objects.ImageMeta model instead of using anonymous dicts, since Nova's intends to 100% eliminate passing & use of dicts for image properties in favour of an explicit model. So if there is a desire to share the code, it wouldl have to be re-factored so that all the neccessary signature relatsed parameters are explicitly passed in, rather than passing in the image meta dict directly.",

Amend Nova implementation to take in image properties as individual parameters, not bundled in a dict or ImageMeta object.\n2. Remove other Nova-specific aspects of the signature_utils class, but continue implementing the spec and keep the code in Nova for Mitaka.\n3. At the beginning of the N development cycle, after Glance no longer has to give deprecation warnings for the outdated approach, merge the signature_utils module into oslo as oslo.signature_utils and remove the duplicate code from Nova and Glance.\n\nThoughts?",
