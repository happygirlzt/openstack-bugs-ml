However since LXC does not understand this concept it was\n    not passing any information, so the image was never being copied.\n    \n    Send some basic information about the disk when the instance is being\n    created in order for the image to begin. Fixes LP: #1126348\n    \n    Change-Id: I90daf853903737013be0cd23f78c7f61e4e15a77\n    Signed-off-by: Chuck Short <email address hidden>\n",
