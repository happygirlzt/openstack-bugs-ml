There was no longer any point in switching it back to private security after that, so I have reset it to public security again.\n\nThis report requests an additional security feature, a password complexity checker, and as such is squarely class D (security hardening) in our report taxonomy: https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy\n\nI recommend switching this to a normal public bug, marking the security advisory task \"won't fix\" and adding the \"security\" tag to indicate a potential security hardening opportunity. If there are no objections, I'll do that early next week.",
