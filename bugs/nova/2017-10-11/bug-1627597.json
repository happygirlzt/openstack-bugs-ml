    "description": "If you create an instance backup by passing rotation 0 to the backup api, nova creates an image and takes a snapshot of an instance and then deletes it immediately. Any malicious user can use this loophole by calling backup api for all instances belonging to his/her project causing consumption of glance and nova resources at the expense of service provider.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create the instance\n\n$ nova boot --flavor <flavor_id> --image <image_id> <instance_name>\n\n2. Create the instance backup using the backup api by giving the rotation parameter value as 0\n\n$ nova backup <instance_id> <name> daily 0\n\n3. Check the glance image list\n\n$ glance image-list\n\nOutput:\nIn glance images you will not found backup image as it will be deleted immediately after creation.\n\nExpected result:\nIf user passes rotation 0, then nova shouldn\u2019t create an image and take a snapshot of an instance and upload it to glance service or minimum value of rotation should be changed from 0 to 1.",

            "content": "Hi All,\n\nI want to propose 3 solution when rotation parameter is 0 while taking instance backup.  \n\nSolution 1: If user passed rotation 0 to create instance backup then avoid the backup image creation at api     side and delete all the previous backup images in api side itself. \n\nPros: 1. Solution 1 will require minimum changes in code and will not make call to the compute node.\n\nCons: 2. The drawback of this solution is, it might impact on the response time if there are too many backups for that instance.\n\nSolution 2: Avoid the backup image creation at api side and call the compute node by passing the image_id parameter as None and delete all the previous backup images at the compute node for the given instance.\n                                                \nCons : 1. This solution need maximum changes at several places.\n       2. Calling the compute node only for previous backup image deletion doesn't make any sense.\n                   \nSolution 3: Change the api-spec that rotation parameter value should be greater than 0.\n\nPros: 1. Minimal changes required\n\nCons: 1. User will need to delete the last backup image explicitly.\n\nTo get the backup images of the specific instance for the explicit deletion, user needs to find out by using the following command:\n\n$ glance image-list --property-filter <KEY=VALUE> \n\nFor example: $ glance image-list --property-filter instance_uuid=6d2b9b03-929e-4f9c-9977-05f3c2f3a47c\n\nI want to recommend solution 1 and 3 is better one out of the three solutions.\n\nPlease let me know your opinions about the same.\n",
