It turns out that no entry is returned and '_create_dns_entry(entries[0], id, domain)' fails with 'List index out of range' error.\n\nAlso, the method 'v2/{tenant_id}/os-floating-ip-dns/{domain}/entries/{ip}' should return a list of DNS entries for a given domain and IP as the documentation says.",
