You don't have to place root on partition /dev/vda1. Even you don't have to use virtio... I think we should move the template files included in nova/virt/ to etc/ and install them to /etc/nova to make clear: Those templates are not usable for everyone and maybe you have to modify them for your purposes...\n\nAnd maybe it's better to use one template file for each hypervisor. I don't like the if/else/stuff in the template file.",
