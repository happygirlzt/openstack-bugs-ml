However if you look at 'nova evacuate' doc (http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/nova_cli_evacuate.html), there is only one link and it's dead unfortunately (http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/configuring-migrations.html). I've found older version here (http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-compute/admin/content/configuring-migrations.html), after short read, everthing became clear.\n\nSecondly, message from log was ambiguous for me \"InvalidSharedStorage: Invalid state of instance files on shared storage\". Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's too generic. I would rather see \"Can't access <path>/create in <path>...\", but as i wrote I'm quite new with openstack.",
