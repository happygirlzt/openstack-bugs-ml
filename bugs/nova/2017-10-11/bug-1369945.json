Surely the placement logic that would happen on a single NUMA node system  should pretty much \"just work\" and give the same result as if we hadn't had any NUMA.\n\nIf we special case single NUMA node systems to delete their info, then it is going to complicate our life when we come to add support for huge pages, since huge pages are reported per NUMA node and we want to support huge pages in single-node systems",
