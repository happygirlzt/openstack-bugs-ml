Around line 13, the line \"[keystone_authtoken]\" seems to cause all the other flags to be unavailable to nova. I commented it and was then able to synchronize the correct database (MySQL). I do not know if that line \"[keystone_authtoken]\", which is a section header in INI syntax, is required by nova to authenticate itself to keystone, but at least so far, that fixed my issue with the database.\n\nMaybe should the documentation example fixed about that?\n\nHope this helps,\nDimitri\n\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/nova/+question/213485",
