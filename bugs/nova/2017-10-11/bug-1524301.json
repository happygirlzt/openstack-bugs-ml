Mikita and master branch are still impacted because nova continue to insert only one \"Virtio SCSI\" card: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/4261013c830a6bb67844fe0371328c5b3d0add2b/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L3656\n\n3) Steps are:\n* put properties hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi and hw_disk_bus=scsi on a glance image\n* attach more than 6 volumes on it\n* All created scsi controllers should be type \"Virtio SCSI\", but currently only the first card is correct.",

So if you're lucky to have in image which uses virtio-scsi, at least the first 6 disks are visible to the instance, the other ones are attached to the lsi controller.\n\nI'd like to discuss Mehdis workaround, as it simply creates 4 controllers, which might be okay, but in case you attach 25 or more disks, it would end up on the next lsi controller. So how can this be fixed in a good way? Ideas? Pointers?\n\nCheers,\nSven",
