If a volume in that share is still being used\n    by another instance, the umount command will fail with the error 'target\n    is busy' and we will ignore it. Any other error while unmounting will be\n    properly logged. In any case the detach will fail because nova hasn't\n    been able to unmount the share.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1285209\n    Change-Id: I79289524541a88ad359b3465719055cd402b4e3d\n",
