This removes that ability\n    so that only the entrypoints in Nova's setup.cfg can be used\n    to load the scheduler host manager.\n    \n    The scheduler_host_manager config option is updated to only\n    allow the choices that are currently in the setup.cfg.\n    \n    And a release note is added for the upgrade impact of dropping\n    the deprecated classpath loading ability.\n    \n    Change-Id: I886c74afac02d100d472b78522e8295748276e4d\n    Related-Bug: #1403020\n",
