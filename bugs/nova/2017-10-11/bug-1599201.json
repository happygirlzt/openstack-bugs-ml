Is that how it is supposed to work ?. \n\n\u2022I found the root cause to be created by this piece of code  https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L1240. On looking at this, I somehow feel that both block device mapping and device tagging are interdependent on each other. ",

Here is my reproducer:\n\n$ nova flavor-create tiny.eph2 auto 256 1 1 --ephemeral 2 --swap 256\n$ nova boot --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --flavor tiny.eph2 --block-device dest=local,source=blank,tag=foo foo\n\nThis seems to be what the reporter is describing. However, contrary to what the reporter describes, this creates the expected 2G ephemeral disk tagged with 'foo'.\n\nAfter looking at the proposed patch, I tried the following instead:\n\n$ nova boot --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --flavor tiny.eph2 --block-device dest=local,source=blank,tag=foo,size=0 foo\n\nThis doesn't create a BDM. However, this is expected behaviour, because with a size of zero the disk itself isn't created, so there's nothing to map, or tag.\n\nI don't think this is a bug.",

This is expected behaviour: as the size was omitted it defaults to the flavor size, which is zero, so it is not created. We might argue that as the user has explicitly specified one we should raise an error, but that's not related to device tagging.",
