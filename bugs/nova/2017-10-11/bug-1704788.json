In this case, you will be responsible for\n   creating and maintaining the entry point in your 'setup.cfg' file\"\n\nThere was an older change made in Newton to stop allowing classloading of the scheduler driver and instead rely on stevedore:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/254768/\n\nBut that meant you could still put your own scheduler driver \"nova.scheduler.driver\" entrypoint in setup.cfg to load a custom scheduler driver, which was then broken with the use of \"choices\" in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/349666/ for the config option - without warning or a deprecation period on custom scheduler driver entry points, so yeah, seems like a bug to at least communicate this better before removing it.\n\nNote, however, that Nova is and has been for awhile removing the ability to load out of tree drivers and manager classes, so any fix here is likely to still deprecate the out of tree loading ability.",

            "content": "Agreed with Matt about a communication problem.\nThe Ocata consensus was about to say that we would stop using custom drivers also for scheduler, but still accepting custom filters (so people wanting to have a specific driver could just create a filter for the FilterScheduler that would be calling the 3rd-party driver).\n\nThat said, what could we do ? I'm not sure modifying the [scheduler]/driver option for accepting strings instead of choices (the string being the entrypoint name in setup.cfg) should be acceptable because that would mean we would go against the consensus we had in Ocata.\n\nThe real problem is that we previously accepted people to not use our scheduler drivers without asking them why they don't use them. Is that because something is missing for being verified ? Is that because people would want a different scheduler behaviour (for example say a shared-state scheduler or a two-level scheduler like Mesos) ?\n\nNow that we have Placement in Ocata for making sure that hosts being verified by the filters are all accepting resource requests for RAM, disk and CPU, I still do think we can explicitly say to people wanting to use a totally separate scheduler logic to discuss with us why they need that. I honestly think there is room for improvement about custom logics.",
