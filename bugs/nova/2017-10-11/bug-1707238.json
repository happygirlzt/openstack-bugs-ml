We should be trying to detach from the live domain even if we had already detached from the persistent domain in the past.\n\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1633236",

Create a volume.\n$ cinder create --name repro 1\n\n3. Attach the volume to the instance.\n$ nova volume-attach repro 552e833a-5c56-45c0-a670-7cfddaa8112b\n\n4.
