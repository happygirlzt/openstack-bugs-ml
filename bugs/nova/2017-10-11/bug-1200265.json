Unfortunately, this project looks like to be dead, but have some important bugs which makes lives of OpenStack developers harder (e. g. creation of a new unique constraint in SQLite leads to deletion of all existing unique constraints).\n\nA monkey-patching util has been recently merged to Oslo (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/31016/). If it's used in Nova, it will allow us to:\n1) use the unified drop_unique_constraint() function for SQLite backend\n2) fix a bug in SQLAlchemy-Migrate that leads to deletion of existing unique constraints of a table when a new one is added  (SQLite backend)",
