    "description": "A change recently went in (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/12368/) to allow hard reboots to be performed on soft_rebooting instances. This leads to an unfortunate situation in libvirt where a SOFT_REBOOT that is ignored by the guest followed by a HARD_REBOOT will lead to a situation where the reboot occurs twice. First the manual hard reboot will go through, and then the soft reboot will timeout, causing another hard_reboot.",
