Child process which is processing the request get killed after sometime (2-3 seconds) without completing the current request.\n\nMeantime if new request is sent then nova-conductor does not picks that request from rabbitmq for processing. Once nova-conductor is up and running again then it picks the pending requests from rabbitmq for processing.\n\nExpected behavior:\n1. conductor should complete current request before exiting - Not Good\n2. conductor should not accept new request for processing - Good",
