For V2 API, there is no need to having two\n    different clouds having different APIs (one with service filter\n    one without) but just take V2 API as a document bug. This patch\n    will only fix V3 API.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Adds the ability to filter a hosts list request by service for\n    the V3 API.\n    \n    Change-Id: I42163707049300b0dee677558ed49280bcc7369d\n    Partial-Bug: #1224763\n",
