The task_state remains something like 'stopping'\n    even though the action has not been completed or queued, and further\n    requests that depend on task_state will fail (see check_instance_state()\n    in compute/apy.py).\n    \n    The only way out of it is to delete the instance or hack the database.\n    \n    This patch adds a reverts_task_state() decorator to compute/manager.py,\n    which, upon operation failure, reverts the instance's task_state back\n    to None.\n    \n    It also adds a test_state_revert() test to verify that all the actions\n    marked for state reversion do the right thing. It also corrects several\n    other tests that specifically expect the task_state to remain after\n    an error has occurred.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1025722\n    \n    Change-Id: Id4358c508156c713cb953dfa0f01a6f598bc1e7d\n",
