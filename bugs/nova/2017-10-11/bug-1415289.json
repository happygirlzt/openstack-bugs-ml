And according to policy_enforcement operators should only make this more permissive which would be a no-op. Its essentially an API change. \n\nIs this a cleanup like change or is there an actual need for policy enforcement on this resource? If there is will probably need to be done using a dummy microversion",

If this\n    extention is enabled then it extends the used limits API behavior, such\n    that admin can fetch the details of any customer's quota usage by passing\n    the customer's tenant id in query parameters.The API signature for the\n    same is 'v2/{tenant_id}/limits?tenant_id={customer_tenant_id}'\n\n    Change-Id: I89b8b5083e46b899458407426c89a3865e960faa\n    Implements: blueprint customer-quota-through-admin-api\n\n\nStill , it will be better to add a default rule for all limits op.\n",
