    "description": "the Nova has the logic to synchronize the state of virtual machine with the record in database, when the state is stopped but \nthe virtual machine is in running state, it will try to stop the virtual machine with compute api call. But the compute api \ncall has the check that only allow to execute the call when VM in ACTIVE,RESCUED, ERROR state.  So the sync logic is broken here.\n\noption 1:\n   allow to run stop API when VM in stopped state\n\noption 2:\n   add another method in API  such as force_stop , and sync_power_states will use this api to stop the VM.\n\noption 3: \n    sync_power_states to call the rpcapi to stop the VM",

It does this\n    using the compute API.  The compute API checks the vm state before\n    proceeding.  The STOPPED state is treated as invalid.  This patch allows\n    the caller to bypass the state check and makes use of that in this\n    periodic task.\n    \n    Change-Id: I447b6dbd1da72ed33067659708e1755bf8c933d0\n    Closes-bug: #1226965\n",
