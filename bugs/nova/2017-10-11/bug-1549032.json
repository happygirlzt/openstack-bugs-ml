If the end user specifies a min_count that is greater than the calculated  max_net_count the resulting error isn't very useful.\n\nWe know that min_count is guaranteed to be at least 1, so we can replace the existing test against zero with one against min_count.  Doing this gives a much more reasonable error message:\n\ncontroller-0:~$ nova boot --image myimage --flavor simple --min-count 2 --max-count 3 test\nERROR (Forbidden): Maximum number of ports exceeded (HTTP 403) (Request-ID: req-f7ff28bf-5708-4cbf-a634-2e9686afd970)",
