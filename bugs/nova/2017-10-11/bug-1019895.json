These calls will appear to succeed, even though the networks, floating ips, fixed ips, etc. are irrelevant to the quantum deployment.  \n\nWe should add checks to nova (nova-manage?) to prevent this from happening.  \n\nOne option would be for the base NetworkManager class to check and make sure that a network manager will actually be used (i.e., check that the network_api_class is not set to \"nova.network.quantumv2.api.API\").  \n\nOther options would be to modify nova-manage, but that seems less robust.",

For example, nova has commands for using floating-ips, but with quantum floating ips should be created/destroyed/associated/disassociated via quantum.  \n\nWe want to make sure that the user gets a message like: \"It looks like you have nova configured to use Quantum.
