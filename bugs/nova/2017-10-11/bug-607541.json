    "description": "Before the twisted rewrite of the objectstore, if a bucket did not exist, Bucket::__init__ would throw exception.NotFound(), and then the @catch_nova_exceptions annotation would wrap that as a 404.  Now I think the exception is not being caught, and it is simply being thrown as a 500.\n\nThe problem is that e.g. euca-upload-bundle checks to see if a bucket should be created before upload by doing a GET on the bucket and looking for a 404.  This logic now fails.\n\nEssentially, the logic in catch_nova_exceptions has been lost.  I presume NotAuthorized is thrown somewhere also, and should also be caught and wrapped.\n \ndef catch_nova_exceptions(target):\n     # FIXME: find a way to wrap all handlers in the web.Application.__init__ ?\n     def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n         try:\n             return target(*args, **kwargs)\n         except exception.NotFound:\n             raise web.HTTPError(404)\n         except exception.NotAuthorized:\n             raise web.HTTPError(403)\n  \n     return wrapper",

I've now changed that to \"TODO(unassigned) (calling-all-twisted-experts)\", which I believe is the protocol is nobody wants it.  If you really want someone on it, maybe soren could be persuaded as he did the twisted rewrite in the first place?\n\nThe TODO doesn't stop the fix working, it just could be cleaner. I think we should get this merged in as-is, because it breaks the ability for new people to get compute running.\n",
