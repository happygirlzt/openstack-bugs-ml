    "description": "In the melange ipam library (used by the quantum manager) there is a function to verify whether a given subnet exists in melange.  When this work was done there was no direct way to get this from Melange so we had to query all of the ip blocks and then look through them to find a match.  Since then, the Melange folks implemented a new call to check a network directly.  We should switch the ipam library to use that call.\n\nAs an example (from Rajaram):\n\nWe now have the route\n       GET /ipam/tenants/{tenant_id}/networks/{network_id}/\nwith a response posted at http://pastie.org/2835700",
