We don't appear to validate the size of image snapshot names either for example. I haven't tested to see what Glance actually does with a 128M image name but it could cause problems...\n\n---\n\nPutting in middleware to limit the request size is fairly straightforward and shouldn't affect anything that I know of in the OSAPI (it would potentially affect the EC2 API but we can ignore it for this anyway). And it would globally guard against really large requests attacks.\n\nI'm not sure it really belongs in nova's code base long term however. Both Apache and Nginx are quite capable of doing this already and most production deployments are probably using something similar for SSL or load balancing already.\n\nIn summary maybe it is a good short term solution... and long term we can move towards better validation in the OSAPI. We recently added some Validator middleware to EC2's API. Perhaps something similar would help with the OSAPI requests as well.\n",
