This doesn't prevent the instance from booting, but could be\n    confusing to someone debugging a different issue. This patch fixes\n    this issue by fixing the method signature of the __exit__ method of\n    compute utils's UnlimitedSemaphore. UnlimitedSemaphore was bypassed\n    entirely in unit tests because the default value for\n    max_concurrent_builds is 10.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1520633\n    Change-Id: I15825eb3fb1bccb12f4a9148809495ce3e83e3c8\n",
