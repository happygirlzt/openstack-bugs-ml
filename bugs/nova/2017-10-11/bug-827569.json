The bug is that there is no entry in the EC2\nmetadata service, not the EC2 api.\n>\n> There's some new stuff in there, like types, min/max occurances, new\n> elements ...

Unfortunately, to my\nknowledge the metadata service is mostly undocumented.\n\nAll that said, I'm working on the MD code right now for config-drive work,\nso I might make an effort at this.\n",
