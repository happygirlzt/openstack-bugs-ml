All host\n    state is instead fetched from the DB. Some left over fields are still kept\n    by the host manager but contain no data. This change remove the last\n    traces of host capabilities from the scheduler.\n    \n    The baremetal host manager used to rely on capabilities info to\n    decide which host state class to use, VM or baremetal. This has been\n    broken since host capabilities were removed (bug 1260265). The logic to\n    decide on host state class to use is updated to use DB data instead and\n    a test is added to verify the same.\n    \n    Change-Id: I350109492c2addf5fdfaadee7cec4784f244e102\n    Closes-Bug: #1260265\n",
