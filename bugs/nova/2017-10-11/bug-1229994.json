    "description": "Image snapshot through the VC cluster driver may fail if, within the datacenter containing the cluster managed by the driver, there are one or more hosts in maintenance mode with access to the datastore containing the disk image snapshot.\n\nA sign that this situation has occurred is the appearance in the nova compute log of an error similar to the following:\n\n2013-08-02 07:10:30.036 WARNING nova.virt.vmwareapi.driver [-] Task [DeleteVirtualDisk_Task] (returnval){\nvalue = \"task-228\"\n_type = \"Task\"\n} status: error The operation is not allowed in the current state.\n\nWhat this means is that even if all hosts in cluster are running fine in normal mode, a host outside of the cluster going into maintenance mode may\nlead to snapshot failure.\n\nThe root cause of the problem is due to an issue in VC's handler of the VirtualDiskManager.DeleteVirtualDisk_Task API, which may incorrectly pick a host in maintenance mode to service the disk deletion even though such an operation will be rejected by the host under maintenance.",
