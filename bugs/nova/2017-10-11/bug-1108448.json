Create a more general framework for testing data\n    transitions at any db migration.\n    \n    Hook the walk_versions code so as we are about to upgrade to a\n    migration point, attempt to run a _prerun_### function, then follow\n    it up with a _check_### function afterwards. Create some utility\n    functions to make doing things in these _prerun and _check functions\n    pretty concise.\n    \n    This makes these checks db independent, and has it so they'll run\n    however we are running the walk_versions.\n    \n    In doing so, this uncovered a bug in the 147 migration, which is\n    fixed inline. There is no retroactive fix, as 147 was destructive to\n    data, so would have nuked anyone that hit it already.\n    \n    Updated to remove safe_getattr, thanks to jerdfelt for pointer on\n    doing that right.\n    \n    Partially implements blueprint migration-testing-with-data\n    \n    Fixes bug #1108448\n    \n    Change-Id: I8bd92e3688109bfbdf1da21a175055b7263abf45\n",
