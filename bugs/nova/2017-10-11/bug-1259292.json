The trouble happens when the tests fail, and it tells you the\nopposite of reality. This isn't about the examples, it is about the text\nof the failure report.\n\nUnit tests are meant to help debug situations where a developer has\nmisunderstood complex inner workings of things. So if we also tell\nthem that we observed what they expect in the test, and expect what was\nobserved and what was also wrong, we are just decreasing the value of\nthe unit tests.\n\nI agree that early in dev cycles is a better time for low priority issues,\nand this is a low priority, but it is not a low value.\n",

That decorator is an internal interface and\n    not meant for external consumption, and is now causing failures\n    because of recent tempest changes. Plugins should only use documented\n    stable interfaces. [1]\n    \n    Also the use of the decorator here actually adds nothing to the tests.\n    They do 2 things, add a test attr to filter by service and add a skip\n    check on the service availability. However both of these are already\n    done, data_processing is already part of the test_id so filtering\n    will just work and the skip check for sahara is baked into the base\n    test class. So using this decorator does nothing except break the\n    plugin.\n    \n    [1] http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/plugin.html#stable-tempest-apis-plugins-may-use\n    \n    Change-Id: I45587d065c1b7b7f28feb29e8845f8f0f8405b8c\n\ncommit f4db8224967267e91abb05dd9c526318589f383b\nAuthor: ZhiQiang Fan <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Apr 18 22:00:47 2016 +0800\n\n    update options mentioned in tempest readme\n    \n    Some options have already been deprecated but still used in tempest\n    README.rst, let's use the new one.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic3bfb66b0898869149126c21aef0b2fd673385e2\n\ncommit f82c7db143bb7bf3c358e735f9646a17684ba5b6\nAuthor: Luigi Toscano <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Feb 26 11:24:32 2016 +0100\n\n    Use the integrated tempest.lib module\n    \n    Tempest-lib has been reintegrated into tempest (as code, but it still provides\n    a stable API). The old library is still available, but tempest tests are\n    failing because when sahara is installed and exports the scenario tests\n    for python clients, python-lib is not installed (it's correcly in\n    test-requirements.txt, not requirements.txt), and tempest does not\n    install tempest-lib anymore.

If a particluar order is kept as a convention,\n    then it helps to provide a cleaner message to the developer if Unit\n    Tests fail. The following patch fixes this issue.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5209e5889cfe62c66dc675c00e3ccaf22410f637\n    Partial-Bug: #1259292\n",
