    "description": "When we do some operations such as suspend/resume on instances. There is no check for instances' power states. That means we may suspend an instance which is migrating or rebooting. I think this may cause some problems. I think the compute's driver have to design a table for operations on VM's states. Such as when the instances is migrating, you can not suspend it or reboot it.",
