Creating the ImageMeta object with the list of supported properties is a way to codify what's actually known in the ecosystem between nova and glance and what nova supports. Anyone working on nova that needs to get something in to this list needs to be proposing it upstream, else you're stuck with forking that code and adding your own values and dealing with the complications that come with maintaining forked code.",
