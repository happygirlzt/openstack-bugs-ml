    "description": "Hello,\n\nwe have a openstack setup with 4 hosts, folsom, all of them kvm and ubuntu 12.04 LTS (packages from ubuntu-cloud.archive). Resize to same host is enabled and multi_host is true. We use nova-network instead of quantum.\n\nTried the following three times:\n1. launch a instance\n2. associated a floating ip to it \n3. do a resize. \n4. access the machine (does not work)\n\nWith every resize the host providing the vm changes and i think thats the problem:\nThe iptables rules for NAT stay on both, the old and the new host. Even after half an hour that is the case. After a \"service nova-network restart\" everything works fine.\nIf i try a ping i am able to see the request at the old host but there is no response to it because the vm is not there anymore. Same problem with ssh.\n\nDo you think this is a bug or is it not allowed to do a resize with associated floating ip?",
