Currently within xenapi.vm_utils, _generate_disk  will\n    partition the disk starting at '0'.  This misalignment may cause some\n    disk read/write speeds to be less than optimal due to attempting to\n    start at '1' rather than at the start of a sector.\n    \n    Changing this value to '2048' aligns the partition.  Internal testing\n    results have shown this change to significantly improve read speeds\n    to virtual ephemeral drives, while also improving write speeds to the\n    disk (although to a lesser degree).\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1487300\n    Change-Id: I2b33659d66ce5ba8a361386277c5fee47ddcde94\n",
