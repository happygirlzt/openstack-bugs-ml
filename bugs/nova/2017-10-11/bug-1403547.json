However, if we pulled the flavor from the instance,\n    extra_specs are mostly not stored, which means we effectively cut off\n    the scheduler filters from access to those things.\n    \n    This adds that back in for that case, but only temporarily. Soon we will\n    be merging a change to stash real flavor objects with the instance, which\n    will make this moot. However, that may take a while to merge and this is\n    broken now.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia728025345b09687da9744004f0f47ad73ce196c\n    Closes-Bug: #1403547\n",
