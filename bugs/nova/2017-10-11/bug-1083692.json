    "description": "In Essex version (both 2012.1 and 2012.1.3), when I suspend and resume a running VM, I do not see anything in the console log of the VM. I see that when it suspends it wipes out the log and resume does not write the complete log. Usuallly, I depend on this log to see if the networking worked and if the metadata server worked. Though I do not see anything console log, after resuming the VM, I am able to ping and ssh without any problems.",

On resume, the console log is being truncated rather than appended.  I'll take a look to see if we have any options for changing this behavior, or whether this is ultimately a libvirt change.",

I see two options: \n\na) We can open a bug with the libvirt folks to add support for appending to these logs.\n\nb) Do something creative in the Nova libvirt driver to move logs around during suspend/resume (i.e. mv console.log console.log.1), then concat them when returning a console log request (yuck).\n\nThoughts?",
