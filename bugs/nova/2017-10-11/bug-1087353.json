The public key gets imported normally and I can log in without a password.\n\nI checked which metadata APIs are available on my controller (logged into an UEC instance):\n\n    ubuntu@test3:~$ curl http://169.254.169.254/openstack\n    2012-08-10\n    latestubuntu@test3:~$ \n\nThe old API that the Cirros image is trying to reach isn't there, I guess.
