See that in the database the instance has a BDM for swap at /dev/xvdb, but nothing for /dev/xvdc.\n3. See that on the instance it has swap at /dev/xvdc, but nothing at /dev/xvdb.\n4. Try to attach a volume at /dev/xvdb, but fail because the database has swap at /dev/xvdb.\n5. Try to attach a volume at /dev/xvdc, but fail because the instance has swap at /dev/xvdc.\n\nThe above problem was introduced with http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/commit/?id=7f8128f87f5a2fa93c857295fb7e4163986eda25.\n\nThe below explanation is relative to a Nova Git commit as of today (and therefor won't changed).\n\nA BDM for swap, based on the flavor, is created in nova/compute/api.py (pseudo call-stack: [1][2][3][4]), which is incorrectly (based on Xen and historical behavior) assigned to /dev/xvdb (pseudo call-stack: [5][6][7][8][9][10][11]), of which specifically get_next_device_name() insures that /dev/xvdc, the proper device name, will never be used [12].\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/api.py#L775\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/api.py#L829\n[3] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/api.py#L750\n[4] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/api.py#L761\n[5] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/manager.py#L1663\n[6] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/manager.py#L1705\n[7] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/manager.py#L1642\n[8] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/manager.py#L1650\n[9] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/utils.py#L107\n[10] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/utils.py#L120\n[11] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/utils.py#L127\n[12] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/compute/utils.py#L173\n\nThe swap is actually created in nova/virt/xenapi/vmops.py (pseudo call-stack: [13][14][15]), again based on flavor, but with no regard for the previously created bdm for swap.\n\n[13] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/virt/xenapi/vmops.py#L678\n[14] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/virt/xenapi/vmops.py#L741\n[15] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/bd3b5a62/nova/virt/xenapi/vmops.py#L89\n",
