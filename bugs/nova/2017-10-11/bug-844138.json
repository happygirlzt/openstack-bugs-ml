This means that a request for 10 instances in a zone with 2 compute nodes will only result in 2 instances booted, when all 10 could be booted.",

His basic thesis was that weigh_hosts() in classes other than BaseScheduler are responsible for keeping an updated picture of the available resources for a given host.  It wouldn't make sense to get 5 cases of a specific host if that host could only handle having 3 instances.",
