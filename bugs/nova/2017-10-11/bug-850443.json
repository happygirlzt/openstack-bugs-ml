I solved the issue in my case by writing my own resolver, since my project was eventually going to need one; but until eventlet catches up, any project that uses eventlet's (or monkey-patched standard library) name resolution routines will encounter problems trying to run on IPv6.\n\n(For reference, the DNS library that eventlet actually uses fully understands IPv6, and that is in fact what I used inside my resolver\u2026)",
