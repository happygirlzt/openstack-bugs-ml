However, the final message setting the instance to the ACTIVE state is important.  After we've seen an instance go ACTIVE, we should never reset it back to BUILDING.",

This addresses out-of-order messaging issues that can\n    cause an instance to appear to have a huge delay going ACTIVE.  (A\n    periodic task run can later heal the state, but it can take a long\n    while)\n    \n    Fixes bug 1180283\n    \n    Change-Id: I64252b30e2596812f3b84da64b1fc8681661d7f8\n",
