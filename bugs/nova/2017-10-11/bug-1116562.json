    "description": "There's currently no method for guaranteeing iptables rules ordering on any system running nova.  This is because nova adds and removes chains, reordering all the rules on the system.  The goal of this patch is to provide a method for administrators to have a deterministic way of placing rules both before and after nova's own rulesets.",

In some cases we\n    were looking for chains that haven't existed in the\n    code base for 2 years.
