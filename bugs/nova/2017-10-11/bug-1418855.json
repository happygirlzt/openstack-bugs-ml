    "description": "When user reverts previously resized instance then it doesn\u2019t clean up instance files from destination node in non-shared environment (instance path not mounted on shared storage).\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create an instance and wait until it's status is set to 'active'\n2. Resize the instance\n3. Check instance files are present on the source and destination compute nodes in the instance file path\n4. Revert the instance previously resized in Step#2\n\nInstance files are not deleted from the destination compute node.\n\nThis issue is introduced because of the LP bug [1] fixed lately.\nPatch merged [2] in kilo-2 is also back ported to the stable/juno branch [3].\n\nI have a fix for this problem. I am working on unit tests. As soon as patch is ready, I will attached it to this bug.\n\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1399244\n[2] https://review.openstack.org/139693/\n[3] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/149371/",
