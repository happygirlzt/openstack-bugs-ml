    "description": "When doing a live migration of an instance using ceph for shared storage, if the migration fails then the instance directory will not be cleaned up on the destination host. The next attempt to do the live migration will fail with DestinationDiskExists, but will cleanup the directory.\n\nA simple way to test this is to setup a working system which allows a ceph instance to be live migrated, then delete the relevant ceph secret from libvirt on one of the hosts. Live migration to that host will fail, triggering this bug.",

These defaults are wrong for ceph,\n    meaning that the instance directory was not cleaned up.\n    \n    This change ensures the libvirt driver always passes migrate_data to\n    the cleanup callback. It updates the tests to assert this, and also\n    that migrate data is passed to the post-success callback.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1430223\n    Change-Id: I5d428b1c232ec245ff15d3ae54b442a25c1a96a5\n",
