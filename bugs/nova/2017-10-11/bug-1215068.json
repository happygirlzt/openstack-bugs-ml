Prior to this commit just\n    an error message was printed which provided no context for debugging\n    an actual failure. By switching to LOG.exception() instead of\n    LOG.error() a traceback will be printed to show where the exception\n    came from.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1215068\n    \n    Change-Id: If3aaf3d8ec61c3e902c299f3e5889dcafa144a9a\n",
