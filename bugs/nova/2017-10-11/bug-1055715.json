The first is that\n    does not set the instance default_root_device to /dev/xvda so it\n    defaults to /dev/sda. The proper fix for this involves setting the\n    default_root_device in xenapi and a db migration to set the proper\n    default_root_device for existing instances.\n    \n    This patch works around this issue by explicitly setting the prefix\n    to /dev/xvd if the compute driver is xenapi.\n    \n    The second issue is that xenapi never updates the instance record\n    to include default_swap_device and default_ephemeral device. The\n    fix for this involes adding the appropriate update to the instance\n    record and a migration that sets the proper values for all existing\n    instances.\n    \n    This patch works around this issue by explicily checking the\n    instance_type and removing the devices from the list if the compute\n    driver is xenapi.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1055715 and bug 1055712\n    \n    Change-Id: I61aa15e69eb0a22430bb22ea5149b1f0735b3328\n",
