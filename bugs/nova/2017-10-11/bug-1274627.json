This means that, for example, volume attach is\n    allowed even when other operations such as migration are in\n    progress.  As with other operations the check should be against\n    a task state of \"None\"\n    \n    This change also refactors the volume_attach() method a little\n    so that the cells api can include the state decorator checks.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0c4d697cf9d9e431a050c3c1b03e46b8629d182a\n    Closes-Bug: #1274627\n",
