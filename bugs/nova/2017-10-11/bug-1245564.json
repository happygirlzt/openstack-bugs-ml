The get_datastore_ref_and_name function in vm_util.py is aware of tokens but it stops on the first found datastore (line 942) instead searching for the best match over the entire set.\n\nWe should improve get_datastore_ref_and_name to:\n1) clearly specify how the datastore is selected (the current pydoc is wrong)\n2) select the best match by iterating the whole result set",

You could have a perfectly valid patch fixing two problems held up because of a discussion related to only one of the solutions... and the result could be that neither problem gets fixed. So it's in everyone's best interest to deal with smaller patches that do one thing at a time.",
