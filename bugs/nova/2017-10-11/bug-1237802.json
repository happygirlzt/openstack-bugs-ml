IPMI power manager creates an empty file and specifies it as the password file in the ipmitool command line, but ipmitool ignores that file [2].\n\nThis is an uncommon case that an administrator set password empty, but this is not a low importance bug due to it stops the thread.\n\nI think we can avoid this bug by writing '\\0' into the password file [3], since ipmitool checks return value of fgets() is not NULL which means the file is not start with EOF and no error had occurred.\n\n[1] e.g.:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$ nova baremetal-node-create --pm_address 192.0.2.200 --pm_user admin --pm_password '' service-host 1 1000 10000 00:11:22:33:44:55\n\n[2] In ipmitool manpage:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-f <password_file>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specifies a file containing the remote server password.

When the passowrd was\n    empty, ipmitool ignores that file and asks user to set password in stdin.\n    This makes the thread stop.\n    \n    This patch changes power manager to write '\\0' to the password file in the\n    case of empty password, to force the password on impitool.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1237802\n    \n    Change-Id: I44f56129a8ce2af4dda8dea35eb9c60d9518d54b\n",
