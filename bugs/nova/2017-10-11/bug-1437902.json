'Connection.ensure' have been updated\n    to have the same behavior for amqp and memory driver about\n    kombu recoverable_errors. And the hostname and port of the memory\n    driver are set to not fail when we print a log message.\n    \n    Closes bug: #1437902\n    \n    Change-Id: I20d133ac67b8a8a4c51d51b6a1b2369aa44ffe2f\n",
