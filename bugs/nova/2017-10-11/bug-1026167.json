            "content": "Interestingly, https://review.openstack.org/9738 was actually addressing the wrong exception.\n\nNoMoreFloatingIps is raised when the floating IP range is exhausted, whereas the case referred to in bug #1021721 is floating IP quota over-run, which is indicated by a FloatingIpLimitExceeded.\n\nNow the FloatingIpLimitExceeded case is already reported as a 413, since the fix for bug #1021373 landed.\n\nWhereas the initial patch for bug #1021721 is problematic, as it leads to a 500 Server Error due to the retry-after header being left unset.\n\nSo I would propose allowing the exception.NoMoreFloatingIps to bubble up to the FaultWrapper middleware, and then treating this as a 404 as opposed to a 413.\n\nThe reasoning here is that NoMoreFloatingIps extends NotFound, which is in turn associated with the 404 status, so the intent appears to be that floating IP range exhaustion is treated as a free floating IP resource not being found.",

NoMoreFloatingIps is raised\n    when the floating range is exhausted, whereas FloatingIpLimitExceeded\n    is raised on over-quota.\n    \n    Also the HTTPRequestEntityTooLarge exception raised is mapped\n    to 500 Server Error due to the required retry-after header being\n    left unset.\n    \n    We now allow the NoMoreFloatingIps to bubble up to the FaultWrapper\n    middleware, where its mapped to a 404 status due to it extending\n    the NotFound exception.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id35c487113059ec3053f2f9e9e7eca24854ac02c\n",
