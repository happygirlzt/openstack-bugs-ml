When it happens nova leaves destination host in inconsistent state, and attempt to run live-migration again fails.\nHere is small investigation of a problem:\nnova creates instance directory on target compute node:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L6152\nin second run it fail here, because dest node wasn't properly cleanedup:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L6148\n\nAlso it's really strange, that when pre_live_migration on dest node fails, flow returns to source which decide is that really required to clean_up destination or not. It will be more clearer to wrap pre_live_migration with try/catch and rollback it before response to source node:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py#L4962-L4984\n\nDevstack nova version:\nstack@node1:/opt/stack/nova$ git log -1\ncommit a71912ef463761187ef785118fbb0e51a5e91ba3\nMerge: ea4e95e 6b2d616\nAuthor: Jenkins <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Aug 24 16:07:32 2015 +0000\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Merge \"Fixed indentation\"\n\nController with compute node nova.conf:\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/426934/\n\nCompute only nova.conf:\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/426936/\n\n\n*UPDATE* \nroot cause of the problem:\nrollback_live_migration_at_destination \ndo several things: \none of them is deallocation nova-network resources over call of setup_networks_on_host with teardown=True.
