The bug is in the kilo conductor when it's trying to resolve the flavour of the instance in backporting.",

This adds that information to\n    the warning that's logged on startup and to the devref doc on upgrades\n    so people know that cells is still a special kitten that must be treated\n    differently.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1479181\n    \n    Change-Id: Idd57f8daa308543a1733092f427e41b1a205b1d1\n",
