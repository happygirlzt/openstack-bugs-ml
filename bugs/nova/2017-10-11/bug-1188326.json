    "description": "The virtualization drivers perform several steps in preparation for attaching a volume to an instances. These are transient in nature and if a compute node's host system is rebooted, the VMs with attached instances cannot start. These include file system mounts and iSCSI initiated connections. The problem is known to occur with libvirt, but may also exist with other virtualization technologies.",
