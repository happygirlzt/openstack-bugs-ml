Secondly, the host_name is comes from the nova.conf vmware.host_ip which does not indicate a port can be specified.  So I'll update the comments in vim.py.",

According to nova.conf, port isn't\n    even part of the host option.\n    \n    This patch will create a separate port option to nova.conf instead\n    of allowing the port to be part of the host_ip option.\n    \n    DocImpact: new host_port option added to nova.conf\n    Change-Id: Iebd415b5b3a9d2be42861220366135d2cb57b14d\n    Closes-bug: #1287292\n",

So\n    we need to allow for better support for both ipv6 and non\n    standard urls when dealing with both SOAP and WSDL urls.\n    \n    Examples:\n       https://[fd2e:1201:1d9f:0:8886:78e0:38cd:cb03]/sdk\n       https://[::1]:9443/sdk/\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1287292\n    \n    Change-Id: I84ab38087ea77a30f6082d8c3fae0341e3371a78\n",
