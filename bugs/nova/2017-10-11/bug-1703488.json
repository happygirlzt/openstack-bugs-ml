Plug two different model PCI devices and add two PCI devices information into nova.conf in target compute node and each control node by following format:\n\n2. Restart nova-api, nova-scheduler, and nova-compute.\n\nCompute node only shows the last device I add.\n\nBut if I do some actions on instance with the flavor contained PCI passthrough info, it will be normal.\n\nAnd database info is correct.\n\n3. Remove one of the PCI device info from nova.conf (included target compute and controllers), restart services, shutdown the compute node and unplug the device.\n\n(Note: The card ID of what I remove is 1002:68c8)\n\nPower on the compute code and check nova-compute log, the report is correct.
