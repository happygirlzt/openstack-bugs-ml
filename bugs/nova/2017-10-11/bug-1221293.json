    "description": "We are calling sr.scan an excessive number of times. This appears to be exposing odd race conditions inside SR.scan, but most of the time, there is no advantage in us having called sr.scan, lets be more selective about our use of this tool.\n\nWe need to look at the wait for VHD coalesce logic, as its unlikely to need any sr.scan.\n\nThe GC will be triggered by a VDI.delete, so we should just rely on that to trigger the process.\n\nThis is related to the work to remove the VDI.copy workaround:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1215383",
