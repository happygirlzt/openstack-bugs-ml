    "description": "When the nova manager starts it goes through code to initialise the host (init_host), including each instance (in _init_instance). The _init_instance code checks  the instance power state in the database; if it is power_state.RUNNING and the instance on the host is not power_state.RUNNING, it will start the instance. One side-effect of this is that instances that are in the task state \"deleting\" and are not there when the manager starts up will be recreated.\n\nThis needs to be changed to stop deleted instances being recreated.",
