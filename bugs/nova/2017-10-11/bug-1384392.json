This patch introduces a common\n    method for initialization of instance snapshot metadata and uses it in\n    the custom cases.\n    \n    Also this fixes a bug for volume-backed instance snapshots: properties\n    restricted to be inherited by config are inherited though.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1384392\n    Change-Id: I811405bbe98e391f76b868cd35b03ca3dced8cdd\n",
