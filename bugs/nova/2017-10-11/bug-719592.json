After attaching a new compute node there went none of the scheduled instanced to this node. I think it would be useful to reschedule the already scheduled instances after attaching a new compute node to direct use the new node.\n\nI think this is a bug, because if I see a resource problem in my openstack environment and I try to resolve this problem by attaching a new compute node I have no advancement at the moment.",

Support for rescheduling means we'd need to keep some extra state to allow rewriting history... I'm not convinced by the net gain, but i'll let scheduler experts comment too :)",
