Make sure to convert\n    it to a dict before calling instance_create() in the child cell.\n    \n    This also adjusts the previous similar fix for system_metadata to make\n    sure to not drop any sys_meta that was passed down.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1197166\n    \n    Change-Id: I38937ebe5ae81158d51992f4efd047531b53302c\n",
