    "description": "The recently merged patch (https://review.openstack.org/484949) runs the migration in the driver's init_host() method. It has since been pointed out that if there are multiple computes handling ironic, some instances can get skipped if the hash ring is refreshed and an unmigrated instance is placed on a compute whose init_host has already run. While a rare thing, this should be corrected to ensure that all instances have their flavors migrated in Pike.",
