Instead make it a reasonable value\n    such as 5 seconds.\n    \n    This is so the surprising behavior of a service not\n    reporting when you start it up doesn't happen if your\n    report interval is configured to a larger value.\n    \n    For example, in an environment where there are many\n    services it may not be optimal to have them all reporting\n    every 10 seconds which is the default. You may have them\n    report every 5 minutes. It is confusing to start up the\n    service and not have it show as available until 5 minutes\n    later.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1226370\n    \n    Change-Id: I85c4146bfa465fffaf89d4c2c74e6cb4ef84cee2\n",
