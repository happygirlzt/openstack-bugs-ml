Adding a describedby link to an extension object should point me at a resource that describes the structure of an arbitrary extension entity. It shouldn't be specific to any extension itself.\n\nLooking at http://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xml, I think 'related' actually makes more sense. According to http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287, a 'related' resource \"signifies that the IRI in the value of the href attribute identifies a resource related to the resource described by the containing element.\" Would you agree?",

I think that that's appropriate use of describeby.\n\nI'm sure that related can also fit, but I think that in this case describeby is more specific to what we want. ",
