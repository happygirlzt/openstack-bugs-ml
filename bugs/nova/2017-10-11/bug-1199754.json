That means the API in vCenter and ESX don't expose a way to grab text based console output. If I'm wrong, I'd love to hear about it.\n\nBased on this document:\nhttp://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp#com.vmware.wssdk.apiref.doc/vim.VirtualMachine.html#createScreenshot\n\nNOTE: I would love to be wrong about this, but I don't think there's a generic way to solve the problem. There is probably a guest/instance vmtools set of commands that might be used to solve the problem in a guest/instance specific way.",
