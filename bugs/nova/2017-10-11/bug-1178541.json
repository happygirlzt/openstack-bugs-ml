The `transport_url` is a string representation of the `oslo.messaging.transport.TransportURL` which supports multiple hosts. The `transport_url` field is written to the DB when a new cell is created using `nova-manage cell create`\nIMO support for multiple rabbit servers can be added by modifying `nova-manage` script so that it accepts a comma separated list of host:port rather than/in addition to separate hostname and port parameters that it accepts currently.\nI have tested the solution by modifying the transport URL in the DB manually and adding multiple host names in that.

Each server\n    is specified using hostname:port with both being mandatory. The existing\n    --hostname and --port options continue to remain but are only considered if no\n    --broker_hosts is specified.\n    Internally, each host is converted to a oslo.messaging.TransportHost\n    and added to the generated TransportURL.\n    This patch also adds unit tests for creation of the TransportHosts from\n    user given input.\n    \n    Change-Id: I14de860b1d12f3e2c0169b58651d580792d6ce0e\n    Closes-Bug: 1178541\n",

This is under Icehouse.\n\nI've tried both of the following formats:\n\nrabbit://user:password@host1:5672,host2:5672/vhost\nrabbit://user:password@host1:5672,user:password@host2:5672/vhost\n\nMy particular situation is that host1 is down.  When nova-cells starts up, it only ever tries to connect to host1 (which it never can.)  It never moves on to try host2.\n\nIs there something in oslo messaging that prevents a failover to the other host(s) in the list, if the first host is never connected to?",
