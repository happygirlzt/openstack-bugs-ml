The code [1] to clean up the current allocations was only deleting allocations where the consumer _and_ resource provider matched the incoming allocations. We want to wipe the slate.\n\nHuge hat tip to gibi for doing the necessary digging to get this going.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/objects/resource_provider.py#L1509-L1520",
