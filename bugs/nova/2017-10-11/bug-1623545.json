    "description": "The min_unit, max_unit and step_size values of resource provider inventory are not checked when submitting allocations. Only available capacity.\n\nThis is a known issue, a deliberate decision was made to put it off until later, but we need to record the presence of the issue. What's suppose to happen is that in addition to checking capacity, we also want to make sure that the allocation is between min_unit and max_unit and cleanly divisible by step_size. These checks should happen in the OVO code, not the API level.",
