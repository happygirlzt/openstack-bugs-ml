    "description": "If an exception is raised during spawn instance (in XenServer), we can end up leaving the swap as an orphaned VDI. \n\nThere are two approaches to fixing this:\n\n1. A long, involved approach of refactoring much of _create_vm into separate, atomic steps that can support fine-grained undoability.\n\n2. Making _create_vm's undo func call _destroy instead of _destroy_vm.\n\n\n1) is probably too risky for this late in the release, so I'm opting for 2) with an eye to tackling a more complete rework down the road.",
