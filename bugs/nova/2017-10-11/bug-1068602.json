If your setup were completely working correctly it would connect every time.\r\n\r\nThe Nova team is much better equipped to debug NoVNC issues than the Horizon team. All Horizon does is get that URL and connect to it in an iFrame.\r\n\r\nThat said, one reason I *have* seen the NoVNC service fail intermittently like that is in multi-node/proxied systems where you're running multiple NoVNC services (such as on each node) and so when the dashboard tries to connect to the URL that the API returned it ends up hitting a service that didn't originate the URL/token so it gets rejected. That may or may not be the case here, but is one avenue worth investigating.\r\n\r\nAll in all I'm pretty sure this isn't a Horizon bug, at least without further details.",
