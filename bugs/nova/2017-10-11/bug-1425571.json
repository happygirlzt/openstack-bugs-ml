    "description": "I came across this issue for a simple typo in virt_type parameter in the file nova-compute.conf (same results if the parameter is defined in nova.conf) where I wrote:\n\n[libvirt]\nvirt_type = quemu\n\ninstead of \"qemu\". \n\nIn the Horizon dashboard this lead to an error with explanation \"Failure to prepping block device\" (see image in attach), not only useless, but misleading since I thought about a problem with cinder.\n\nAlso the log file nova-compute.log was not so clear (see text file in attach): once again \"Failure prepping block device\" with the addition of this info: \"NovaException: Unable to determine disk prefix for None\".\n\nOnly analyzing the python code of the file in the traceback of the log (nova/compute/manager.py, nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py, nova/virt/libvirt/blockinfo.py) I could understand that the disk prefix (i.e. vd/hs/sd) is indeed bound to CONF.libvirt.virt_type (i.e. virt_type parameter in nova.conf).\n\nConfiguration files can be modified by operators and I don't think they should have to look at the code to get a clue of what is going on, especially for an error that can be simply (at least this is my first impression) caught and tracked.",
