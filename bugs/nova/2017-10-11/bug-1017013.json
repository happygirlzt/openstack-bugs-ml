If it is set to false then the ips should be reclaimed after a set timeout period (ten minutes by default) via a periodic task in the network worker. If they are not being reclaimed properly then there is definitely a bug somewhere, although I have not seen this happening recently myself.\r\n\r\nCould you confirm that IPs are not released even after the periodic task kicks in ?",
