    "description": "Several methods in nova.compute.api alter the vm_state value before proceeding with the actual work. In some cases, this will be a semantic no-op as it is set to a value specified in  check_instance_state decorator. In other cases, it seems possible that a race condition might occur. However, in other cases when multiple valid start states are allowed, the initial state may be changed to something other than the initial state. This is a violation of the suggested rules around vm_state changes (i.e. the vm_state should not be modified until a task is complete) and leaves us in a bind: since we do not know what the initial state actually was, we cannot reasonably recover and the aforementioned set of rules state that the vm_state should be set to ERROR if a problem with the operation occurs. There are several instances where setting the instance state to ERROR is completely avoidable an unecessary if the initial vm_state is left alone until the task is complete and error occurs.\n\nSome examples are: \n\nrescue\nsuspend\npause\n\nJudging from the code history, this seems like it might be a remnant from a time when there was some mixing between what is now the vm_state, task_state and power_state values.",
