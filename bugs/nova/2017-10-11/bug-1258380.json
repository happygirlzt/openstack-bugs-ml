Instead of just returning an empty list, let's be more explicit\n    and raise a NotImplementedError. This will be more descriptive if\n    someone is trying to use this part of the NeutronAPI.\n    \n    Commit 45e92d4703 contains the changes to use the db layer instead of\n    the network rpcapi.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2a9ada8186fd4165c7fceb15965055b5793e6e2c\n    Closes-Bug: 1258380\n",
