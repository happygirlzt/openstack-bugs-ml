This patch introduce mechanics\n    that allows to schedule action, e.g. force-complete on\n    active migration, and execute it in the right time.\n    It fix issue that allow to leave active instance paused\n    after live-migration.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1580609\n    \n    Change-Id: Iadd8f57949b99a893b7c2c3a19084a21ae6290f9\n",
