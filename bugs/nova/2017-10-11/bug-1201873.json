This includes running vish-ha (multihost), or if you ever\n    set a dns server. However if you don't do these things we continue to\n    use /etc/hosts.\n    \n    It's not clear that this does anything other than create\n    inconsistency. There is a long standing bug that exists around this\n    because the impacts include exposing localhost as a dns entry on the\n    network.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibccf0999bfd4b37f2d948af34640260f95c54572\n    Closes-Bug: #1201873\n",
