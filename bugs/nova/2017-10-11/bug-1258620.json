Because of this\n    if someone creates a port in neutron with a device_id that matches one\n    of their existing instance_ids that port will eventually show up in\n    nova list (through the periodic heal task).\n    \n    This problem usually manifests it's self when nova-compute\n    calls to neutron to create a port and the request times out (though\n    the port is actually created in neutron). When this occurs the instance\n    can be rescheduled on another compute node which it will call out to\n    neutron again to create a port. In this case two ports will show\n    up in the network_cache table (since they have the same instance_id) though\n    only one port is attached to the instance.\n    \n    This patch addresses this issue by only adding ports to network_cache\n    if nova successfully allocated the port (or it was passed in). This\n    way these ghost ports are avoided. A follow up patch will come later\n    that garbage collects these ports.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1258620\n    Closes-bug: #1272195\n    \n    Change-Id: I961c224d95291727c8614174de07805a0d0a9e46\n",
