For now, we can\n    detect if Nova compute is running on ppc64 or ppc architecture systems\n    and set the default to 'vga', which is supported on PowerKVM.\n    \n    This patch did some reordering of the logic in\n    nova.virt.libvirt.driver.LibvirtDriver.get_guest_config in an attempt to\n    set the video.type depending on the compute host architecture and\n    implementation specifics. The video.type can still be set using\n    image_meta.\n    \n    Change-Id: I49a1a8e6d9ebdc28d876d2f958c8cb960892f322\n    Closes-Bug: 1274367\n",
