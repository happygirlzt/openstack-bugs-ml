An extract from the change is at the end of comment.\n\nWhen the bug  https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1260771 will be corrected, fake + kvm compute nova deployments will be possible. If you use scheduler limiting filters (RamFilter, CoreFilter, etc.) to avoid kvm compute overload, you also constraint fake computes capacity (which is currently hardcoded to a very low value)!\n\n\n\"\"\"\nThe number of instances supported by fake computes is not limited by physical constraints.\nIt allows to perform stress tests on a deployment with few resources (typically a laptop).\nBut you must avoid to use scheduler filters limiting the number of instances per compute (like RamFi\nlter, DiskFilter, AggregateCoreFilter),\notherwise they will limit the number of instances per compute.\n\n\nFake computes can also be used in multi hypervisor-type deployments in order to take advantage of fake and \"real\" computes during tests\n* create many fake instances for stress tests\n* create some \"real\" instances for functional tests\n\n\nFake computes can be used for testing Nova itself but also applications on top of it.\n\"\"\"",

One should be able to schedule an instance\n    larger with more then 8GB of ram onto the FakeDriver.\n    \n    Since the FakeVirt driver is now used for much more then just unit\n    tests, subclass FakeVirt to decouple the amount of resources FakeVirt reports\n    from the amounts in the api_samples. This way the api_samples don't need changing every\n    time the resource amounts reported by FakeVirt are tweaked.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifd3b8bd1abf985d279de334776ed5feb4fa72a27\n    Related-Bug: #1268943\n",
