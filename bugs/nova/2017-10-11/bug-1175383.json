This is\n    especially true of one named 'tiny' since the unresized image could\n    potentially be very large, leading to the unexpected result of a\n    'tiny' instance consuming a massive amount of disk.\n    \n    The no-resize behavior is still supported, so if it's being relied on\n    for testing, additional, non-default flavors can still be created that\n    enable it.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Fixes bug 1175383\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifa5827c7f87dae95214bc4a585adce5735a05d83\n",
