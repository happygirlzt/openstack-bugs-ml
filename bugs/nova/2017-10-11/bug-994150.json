    "description": "IPv4 addresses can be more efficiently stored in MySQL as an (UNSIGNED) INTEGER instead of as a UTF8 VARCHAR(255). The former requires only 4 bytes; the latter requires between 8 bytes (a.b.c.d) and 16 bytes (aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd) of storage, and up to 765 bytes of memory for certain operations where MySQL allocates memory based on the max row size (eg, sorts and in-memory temp tables).  Changing both  `fixed_ips`.`address` and `floating_ips`.`address` to UINT looks to me like it would have a positive impact for deployments with very large numbers of IP addresses. There might be other columns that could benefit from this as well.\n\nI can't speak to the efficiency of other databases from experience, but I expect the performance difference would be similar.",
