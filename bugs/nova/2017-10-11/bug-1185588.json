    "description": "This impacts Grizzly and master.\n\nAny instances created prior to Grizzly will fail to block migrate.   Prior to Grizzly, the default image structure was to convert all base images to RAW, then resize said image to match that of the selected flavor.  Thus, the _base directory would contain <image_hash> and <image_hash>_<size_gb>.  From there, QCOW2 files would be created, based on the resized backing file.  The entire notion of resized base files was eliminated with Grizzly (rightfully so) and with it the code which would handle creating these resized backing files.\n\nThe problem is that many environments still have instances created with this backing structure.   When utilizing live block migrations (nova live-migration --block-migrate), we rely on the destination hypervisor to re-populate _base images from Glance.  Therein lies the problem, we do not have the code to detect or generate <image_hash>_<size_gb> base images.  Thus, the block live migration will fail.  The same situation applies if a _base image happens to go missing.  We added code in Grizzly to re-download/generate missing _base images upon instance reboot, which cannot currently succeed due to the same issue.",
