This was added because the person\n    who wrote the thread pool code was afraid of regressions for existing\n    deployments. But now we have enough features in nova that require\n    that this is always set to True or else users can have issues with\n    them. To this point the firewall overrode this option to make\n    sure that its call was always in a native thread no matter the\n    value of this option was.\n    \n    The reasons behind this were discussed during this review:\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/57000/\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1254811\n    \n    DocImpact: removes api_thread_pool flag from the libvirt group\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifad7f1bdf2af69e4fcd6f9a04bf2f7ff5251afd6\n",
