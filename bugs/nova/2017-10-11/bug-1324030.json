            "content": "The scheduler should not have access to the list of instance_uuids, and I have been working to remove that.  The reason that they're there now is for logging and to use the length of the uuid list to know how many instances to schedule.  The request_spec now has a num_instance field to pass information on how many instances to schedule, and logging can be handled elsewhere.\n\nI don't see how having the instance uuid provides any value to the scheduler as it will not be allowed to look up information on that instance.  If there's some functionality that depends on it that I'm not considering then we should have a discussion about how best to provide what it needs without linking it to an instance directly.  There is a work in progress to split the scheduler out of Nova and part of that is decoupling the scheduler so that it can rely on properties to filter/weigh on that are not tied to a specific instance.",
