The problem is, a latency spike could cause the subsequent kill to wait long enough for the sleep to go away, and then boom, test suck.\n\nInstead of sleep, perhaps cat with stdin=PIPE stdout=PIPE stderr=STDIN would sit there doing nothing indefinitely.",

Here your \"cat\" will survive a lot longer (until all tests complete and parent process dies ?) which might or might not be an issue ?\n\nMaybe consider terminating that subprocess at the end of test_KillFilter ?",
