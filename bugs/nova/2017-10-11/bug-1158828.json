We seem to be hitting an IntegrityError (which returns 0 rows deleted) for the last assertion in that test case.

One thing I've discovered is that removing the initial:\n\n        # The first try to archive console_pools should fail, due to FK.\n        num = db.archive_deleted_rows_for_table(self.context, \"console_pools\")\n        self.assertEqual(num, 0)\n\nseems to allow the test case to pass.",

So I think it might be an issue with the older SQLite version.  The SQLite changelog does not say anything about PRAGMA foreign_keys changing after 3.6, but the SQLAlchemy docs say that the minimum supported SQLite version for foreign key support is 3.6.19.  Technically RHEL 6 just meets that requirement, but maybe there were still problems with it in early versions.\n\nI'm going to skip this test if the sqlite version is less than 3.7.\n\n",
