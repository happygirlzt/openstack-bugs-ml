It is expected that this would be\n    used for run a LOGDROP action before actually dropping the packet.\n    \n    DocImpact: the drop action for iptables rules can now be configured\n    for nova-network users with the iptables_drop_action flag.\n    \n    Change-Id: I15720d2742955611929a4d7181a269795296e025\n",
