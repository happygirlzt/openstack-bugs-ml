Also, the docstring examples have the LUNs appearing to be integers so IMO, this should be changed in the NetApp driver as well in order to have consistency.\n\nSure, another way to do it would be to simply modify the Hyper-v driver to be agnostic about that LUN variable type, but I\u2019d rather  go on fixing this on Cinder.",
