The initial assumption was that this\n    was because a request id was not initially available, causing one\n    to be generated for the first log entry that later was replaced\n    by the request id middleware.\n    \n    In the process of debugging that it became clear that the id was\n    in fact the request id of the previous request because the context\n    was being reused under the covers in oslo_log and olso_context.\n    \n    Therefore the auth, context and request id middlewares are now\n    changed to be active in the middleware stack before the request log\n    middleware. The unfortunate side effect of this is that the Starting\n    message and final request logging is no longer actually bounding the\n    full request: it misses three critical middlewares.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifa412973037193e4e67a0c9d2c71c7a4847980a9\n    Closes-Bug: #1626493\n",
