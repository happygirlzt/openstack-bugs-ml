The code to write vm-data/networking ends up writing JSON, but that won't correctly escape any apostrophes.\n\nI'm not completely familiar with how things like DNS servers and other data get set, but that may or may not be a means to get user data through.\n\nBut if/when vm-data/hostname is set, that might provide a very easy way to exploit.\n\nSo while I'm not positive there is an exploit right now, it could be a time bomb waiting for a future feature to open an exploit.\n",
