    "description": "I have project A with user Anna, who has a role representing nova admin assigned (needed to allow creation of private flavors).\nI have project B with user Ben, who has a role representing nova admin assigned (needed to allow creation of private flavors).\nAnna has no permission on project B.\nBen has no permission on project A.\n\nAnna creates a private flavor 'A_private', gives flavor access to project A.\n\nExpected behaviour: only Anna (or any other nova admin in project A) can perform actions on this flavor.\n\nIssue: Ben can perform all sort of actions on the private flavor 'A_private' (read, delete, manage access, manage extra specs).\n\nObserved in Mitaka, but I haven't seen any updates related to this, so this should be the same in master. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",
