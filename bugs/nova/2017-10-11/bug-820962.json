Since there is not way to set display name with euca tools, for a normal usecase you would get the \"default behavior\"\n2. The default behavior generates invalid hostnames.\n\nThe code changes all characters to lower case and replaces all \" \" with \"_\".  However, in most unixes \"_\" is an invalid character for a hostname.  \n\nOn ubuntu cloud-init this makes it so the setting of the hostname at boot time fails.",
