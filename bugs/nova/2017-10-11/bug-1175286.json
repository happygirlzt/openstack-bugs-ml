This fails with libvirt complaining:\n\nqemuProcessPrepareChardevDevice:2635 : Unable to pre-create chardev file '/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-000000ae/console.log': No such file or directory\n\nIn the logging of nova I can see nova creates a UUID style directory. Obviously this does not match where libvirt is looking. Upon failure \"instance disappeared\" (which is a very non descriptive error message) this UUID directory remains and is not cleaned up.\n\nI tracked it down to libvirt_utils.get_instance_path which also takes \"forceold\", but this parameter is not used at all anywhere in the code.\n\nSo I see two possibilities: 1) use original path structure or 2) make libvirt aware that is should use another path",
