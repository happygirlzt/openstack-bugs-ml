            "content": "It's not \"exploitable\" as such.  The scenario is:\n\n* Admin sets up a flavor to have a Trust requirement - so the instance will only boot on hosts which have been verified as trusted\n* When booting the scheduler will correctly use the TrustedFilter to identify a host which is verified\n* A live migration is requested by the administrator, without specifying a target host.  In this scenario the conductor task does not correctly fill the parameters expected by the scheduler to enforce any trust requirements.\n\nIn this way an administrator may inadvertently move a VM to a host that may have been compromised (or, more precisely, that has not been verified as secure).\n\nI have not checked the behavior for existing release branches - this is related to code accepted recently during H-3.",
