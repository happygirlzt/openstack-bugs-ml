This one is probably an order of operations error dealing with the order in which the disk is copied and the volume is mounted. This won't be complicated but it will take someone spending several hours with a practical  testing environment to figure out what we should be writing a unit test to catch.",

This is a key/value store,\n    and all the values are strings.\n    \n    When Nova boots an instance from a volume, it passes the image\n    metadata returned by cinder, which is all strings. If a driver\n    expects these values to be ints, as they are when booting from an\n    image, it will get a type error.\n    \n    This change also pulls size from the volume directly rather than\n    taking the value from the stored image metadata. This is because the\n    volume will have been created in 1Gb increments, and is unlikely to be\n    the same size as the original image. It may also have been\n    subsequently extended.\n    \n    (cherry picked from commit 688be19e8a2170276451926401af8257c4faece5)\n    \n    Conflicts:\n    \tnova/compute/api.py\n    \tnova/tests/compute/test_compute.py\n    \n    Change-Id: I7928f6be1ca99f1502941b9df2b443f2ca63a37b\n    Closes-Bug: #1367540\n    Closes-Bug: #1255317\n",
