    "description": "In nova.cells.messaging.Response, the serialization/deserialization was done using the oslo.serialization library which is not correctly serializing a NovaObject because it will loose all related attributes about versioning and classes. Consequently, when deserializing, it will be rehydrated into a dict instead of a NovaObject.\n\nhttp://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/cells/messaging.py?id=9c45ff348d7eb75ae8098b6c950db549aaff282a#n1852\n\n\nThe fix is easy and should call objects_base.serialize_entity() instead.",
