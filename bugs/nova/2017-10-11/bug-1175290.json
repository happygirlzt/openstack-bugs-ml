It'd be useful for folks trying to reproduce/test to double confirm this.\n\nCouple of questions:\n\n   (1) Is your cli something like -- $ nova live-migration --block_migrate <source-host> <dest-host> \n\n   (2) Did you pass any specific options to \"block_migration_flag\" in nova.conf, if yes, can you please note them down here?\n\nThanks.",
