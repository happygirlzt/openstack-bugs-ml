I have used ext3 and that was wrong. \nBut it seems so...because the error message has not enough information to find a real good solution for the problem.\nI mean when you get the message \" Unable to preallocate_images=space at path:\", you really know that it was unable to \npreallocate. What you don't know, is that you have the wrong file system and you don't know that fallocate(1) is used.\nSo the error message could be change to a more information-rich message.\n\nonly I you checked the comment in the source you get it:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/imagebackend.py\n\nthx for the attention",
