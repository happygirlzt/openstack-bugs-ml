    "description": "The scheduler is subject to a race condition which can cause it to incorrectly identify available resources on a particular compute host. The problem occurs if multiple scheduler instances/threads concurrently issue an instance build request (i.e. run_instance) to the same compute host. This situation may oversubscribe the given compute host and cause one or more run_instance requests to fail.\n\nSee blueprint & associated wiki page:\n\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/scheduler-resource-race",
