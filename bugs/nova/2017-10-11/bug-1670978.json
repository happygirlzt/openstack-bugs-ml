These attributes are also returned in a server GET call. However, only an admin can see these attributes.\n\nIt is acceptable that 'OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hostname' should be visible to admins only. But all other attributes should be visible to a non-admin user, especially the owner of the server.\n\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:reservation_id\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:launch_index\t\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:kernel_id\t\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:ramdisk_id\t\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:root_device_name\t\n  OS-EXT-SERV-ATTR:user_data\n\nIt is highly desirable for the server's owner to retrieve back the 'user_data' provided when creating the server.\n\nTo reproduce this under devstack, compare the raw responses from nova-api using the following two commands:\n\n  openstack --os-compute-version 2.3 --os-username demo --debug server show <your_server>\n\n  openstack --os-compute-version 2.3 --os-username admin --debug server show <your_server",
