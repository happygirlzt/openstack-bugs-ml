It bypasses authentication, and allows you to specify the vnc host and port in the url, thereby allowing you to connect to vnc consoles without asking for a token.\r\n\r\nThe vnc host and port is considered private, which is why the api doesn't return that information. Perhaps if the vnc_debug flag is set, we could embed the proper host/port info in the url so that it works by default.\"",
