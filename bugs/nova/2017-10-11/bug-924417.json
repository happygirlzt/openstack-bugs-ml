            "content": "Actually, it might make more sense to leave the scope of this specific rule alone. You could set the policy to an empty ruleset and depend on the compute::... rules (which already check admin or owner). \n\nThe fix for this bug is to provide a default ruleset that allows users to use the 'admin_actions' server actions on instances they own. Turns out that extension name doesn't really make sense :(",

            "content": "Hmm, I really don't like enabling all of these actions, even to instance owners, by default. The migrate, migrateLive, resetNetwork, lock and unlock shouldn't be exposed to end-users without good reason. Additionally, it wouldn't be a good move to split up an existing extension, but maybe if it maintains the same interface it isn't a big deal...\n\n\nAnywho, the temporary fix will still work for existing environments.",
