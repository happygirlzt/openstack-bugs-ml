Using policy.d means that nova-api makes > 33k reparses of the\n    policy files during a gate run.\n    \n    There is no straight forward fix at this point in the cycle given\n    various library freezes in oslo. Instead we should revert using the\n    policy.d directory and merge those rules back into the policy.json\n    file.\n    \n    Change-Id: I588c46819728e839f9e6c03ac3d673646d76b7ff\n    Closes-Bug: #1438861\n",
