The utility function\n    handes InstanceNotFound exceptions and tranlsates them to HTTPNotFound\n    rather than letting them propagate up causing a traceback.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Michael Still <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I8abee22c53195926e3d2af1da9b14cd9d3608e63\n    Closes-Bug: 1270804\n",
