This can make problems\n    with SanISCSIdriver using.\n    \n    Also it may be useful to pass execute parameter to this SanISCSIDriver class\n    to have the opportunity of overriding _execute method (as it is in\n    VolumeDriver class, that is the root of this class hierarchy). That's why\n    special checking was added.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1070489\n    \n    Change-Id: I73f74f9d095a2c4316cab88148afe6a0bde44c5b\n",
