Per mailing list thread, allowing\n    any project to cap one of our own clients actually prevents us\n    from testing that client's git version in devstack gate (because\n    there are 2 ways to install a python client, one from git, one from\n    pip). This can allow bugs to creep into the clients because they are\n    no longer tested in the gate.\n    \n    An exception is currently being made for neutron client because of\n    the need for an incompatible change in their next release.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1200214 for Tempest\n    \n    Change-Id: I00a451448ec380068905b28f3b74656c083dc261\n",
