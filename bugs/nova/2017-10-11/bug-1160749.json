Depending on the quota being changed (default, per-quota-class, per-tenant), we could be having to search for the usage of thousands of tenants, too.  Issuing a warning of some sort might be easier in the nova-manage case, but we're trying to deprecate nova-manage, and I know of no easy way of issuing warnings through the nova API response\u2026and I definitely don't want to see novaclient sending a lot of traffic to nova-api just to check whether a quota change results in someone being over quota.",

If we do not check this in code level, I really don't think admin will take the initiative to do the 'check'.\n\nSo consider to avoid break existing behavior, How about enable the force option to V3 API only?
