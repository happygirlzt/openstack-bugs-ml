To avoid confusion this\n    patch introduce 2 type of ports list VNIC_TYPES_SRIOV\n    and VNIC_TYPES_DIRECT_PASSTHROUGH. The VNIC_TYPES_SRIOV\n    are ports which require pci request, while\n    VNIC_TYPES_DIRECT_PASSTHROUGH  ports require pci device\n    attach/detach from libvirt dom. VNIC_TYPES_DIRECT_PASSTHROUGH\n    is subset of VNIC_TYPES_SRIOV.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1563874\n    \n    Change-Id: I3a45b1fb41e8e446d1f25d7a1d77991c8bf2a1ed\n",
