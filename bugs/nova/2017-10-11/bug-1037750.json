    "description": "My first bug report, so please be kind in case this isn't actually a bug.  (I tried searching and also talking to the #openstack channel before submitting this.)\n\nI'm running Ubuntu Server 12.04 along with OpenStack (see version of packages at the bottom).\n\nI have Nova configured to use Flat DHCP networking in Nova.conf:\n\n# network specific settings\n--network_manager=nova.network.manager.FlatDHCPManager\n--public_interface=eth0\n--flat_interface=eth1\n--flat_network_bridge=br100\n--fixed_range=10.0.118.128/27\n--network_size=32\n--flat_network_dhcp_start=10.0.118.132\n--flat_injected=False\n--force_dhcp_release\n\nbr0 is coming up as 10.0.118.129\n10.0.118.130 is not supposed to be used (I wanted to reserve it)\neth1 on the controller is getting interface IP 10.0.118.131.  \nSo, I want DHCP to start at 10.0.118.132.\n\nFirst problem: OpenStack is ignoring that --flat_network_dhcp_start argument.  The first IP it handed out was .130.  The second IP it handed out was .131.  \n\nSecond problem:  When OpenStack handed out .131, it crashed the  routing on the cloud controller to where the VMs would not route any longer through the public interface (eth0) via the bridge (br100, .118.29).  Even after terminating the VM with the .131 IP address, it required a reboot of the cloud controller to fix the routing issue.\n\nIt would be nice if the --flat_network_dhcp_start would work properly.  In absence of that, could it be possible to manage the private IP addresses in the same way the floating public IPs are managed (i.e. do something like a \"nova-manage privateip delete xx.xx.xx.xx\")\n\nAccording to a discussion in #openstack, a workaround for this is to update the fixed_ips table in the nova database to manually set reserved=1 for the IP Address.  However, that involves directly modifying the database.\n\nThanks!!\n\nOpenStack versions installed below:\n\nii  nova-api                          2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - API frontend\nii  nova-cert                         2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - certificate management\nii  nova-common                       2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - common files\nii  nova-compute                      2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - compute node\nii  nova-compute-kvm                  2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - compute node (KVM)\nii  nova-consoleauth                  2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - Console Authenticator\nii  nova-doc                          2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - documentation\nii  nova-network                      2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - Network manager\nii  nova-objectstore                  2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - object store\nii  nova-scheduler                    2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - virtual machine scheduler\nii  nova-volume                       2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute - storage\nii  python-nova                       2012.1+stable~20120612-3ee026e-0ubuntu1.2  OpenStack Compute Python libraries\nii  python-novaclient                 2012.1-0ubuntu1                            client library for OpenStack Compute API",
