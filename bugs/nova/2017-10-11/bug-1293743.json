Examples of these kind of external \"local dependencies\" include:\n\n* libvirt (used in nova.virt.libvirt)\n* guestfs (used in nova.virt.disk.vfs.guestfs)\n* evzookeeper, zookeeper, and evzookeeper.membership\n* iboot (nova.virt.baremetal)\n\nWe should develop some documentation (in HACKING?) that discusses the appropriate way to import these \"local dependencies\", and then ensure each one in above list is done consistently.",
