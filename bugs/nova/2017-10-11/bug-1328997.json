I'd argue, that the proper fix for this would be to make Nova migration tests not drop openstack_citest database, but rather use openstack_citest user credentials to create schemas on demand. FYI, we have a similar patch to oslo.db on review - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/93424/ and could provide a back port to oslo.incubator, if you like this approach.\n\nA short term work around could be file locks.",

For this goal\n    intended number of base test cases which used in current implementation.\n    Previously there were two ways to run migration tests: using\n    opportunistic test cases (default way we've been using on CI) and\n    by using database connection strings, specified in test_migrations.conf,\n    for every particular database test case. For the sake of simplicity and\n    consistency we are moving to using of opportunistic db test cases here.\n    \n    With this change we are free from locking, so we don't need `lockfile`\n    anymore.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1327397\n    Closes-Bug: #1328997\n    Change-Id: I92b1dcd830c4755f429a0f6529911e607c2c7de7\n",

The main feature of this\n    approach is - for each migration test will be created new database\n    with random name. This will avoid migration tests of race conditions\n    and reduce tests intersection.\n    \n    ``test_migrations.conf`` file was removed, because we create test\n    database for migration test, so we no longer need test database credentials.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1327397\n    Closes-Bug: #1328997\n    \n    Change-Id: I95ad140ba5f483cd3dc36e2b78f140826d57624f\n",
