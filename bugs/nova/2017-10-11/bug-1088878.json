That's exactly that, in the extension create and update_all both use _update_instance_metadata so most of those test don't need to be re-created, although there is no call to update_all method and the fix proposed add this test to update metadata using update_all method. (It's also mentioned in the commit message)",

M. Rodrigues <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jan 2 08:43:39 2013 -0500\n\n    Add unit test to update server metadata\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1088878\n    Partially implements blueprint nova-v2-api-audit\n    \n    The bug description points to 4 situations to be tested, although those\n    situations are already tested on create metadata tests which use the same\n    method as update_all to operate over metadata (_update_instance_metadata) so no\n    more tests are needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifae3c69c0e00c361ae36f5a8dede835c96568d11\n",
