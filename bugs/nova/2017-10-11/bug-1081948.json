It's actually a missing or difference in a package when you're trying to set up the non-virtual environment.  The Venv works fine, and if I use Pips where the Venv uses Pips, etc I don't seem to have this issue.\n\nTake a closer look, but I think this is invalid, but we may want to sort it out and update the developers setup guide to cover it when we have a clear answer.",
