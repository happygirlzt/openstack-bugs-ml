This should never have been the case, but especially not now\n    that the os-volumes APIs are deprecated and don't even work anymore\n    with newer microversions. This change removes the os-volumes policy\n    checks for os-volume_attachment API requests. The code will continue\n    to make os-volumes policy checks for os-volumes APIs, and\n    os-volume_attachment policy checks for os-volume_attachment APIs.\n    \n    Removed the _items method, which was only being called from one place,\n    to resolve comments that policy checks should always happen immediately\n    upon entering the API methods.\n    \n    Change-Id: I35aaedf5c4c49cb568fa06c2974f9a35aa2ffcc5\n    Closes-Bug: #1635358\n    UpgradeImpact\n",
