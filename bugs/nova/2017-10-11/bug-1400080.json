In case of multiple nics, there's no clear way to identify the interfaces in the guest OS if the actual interface naming differs, this is especially valid for Windows instances.\n\nSince the MAC address (hardware address) assigned to each vNIC identifies uniquely the interface, providing the mac address during the template generation solves the issue.",
