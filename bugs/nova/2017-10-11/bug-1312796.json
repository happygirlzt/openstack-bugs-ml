But there's currently no concept of a delete that occurs after whatever action is in motion finishes.  I can see the appeal of that sort of action though.  Perhaps it could be represented by requesting a queued delete that will occur when the instance has no task in motion.  This will require a blueprint and some of the initial tasks work to be finished.",
