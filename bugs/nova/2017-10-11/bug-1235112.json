As a result, the instance cannot be attached to a cinder volume and fails with a message 'unable to find iscsi targets'.\n\nThis is because the driver fails to scan the Host Bus Adapter with the iscsi target portal (or target host). We need to fix the driver to scan the HBA by specifying the target portal.",
