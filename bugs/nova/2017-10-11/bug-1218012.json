As such this is wasted effort which can be eliminated since that\n    verificaiton is not the intent of the tests from what I can gather.\n    \n    In my testing this reduced running times from 19-20 seconds down to 14-15 seconds\n    with all unit tests still succeeding. test_xenapi is the by and far the largest\n    offender in xenapi tests.  Overall xenapi tests we're reduce from\n    21-22 seconds to 16-17 seconds.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1218012\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaa6441655ad100fdb4ffd2bd5eb6265429c133f6\n",
