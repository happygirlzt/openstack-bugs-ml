    "description": "The 'server_group' function is implemented in Icehouse.\nBut we can't determine VM's server_group via 'DescribeInstance()'.\n\nThe only way to get this info is to filter from all server_groups' memberships.\nThat's not an elegant & convenient way.\n\n----------------\nImagine the use case below:\n\n1. One environment has lots of(like 100) server_groups, and each server_group involves 100 instances inside.\n2. One instance has been created into one server_group before. Now I need to create another one with anti-affinity policy with it.\n\n3. Now how can I determine which server_group should I choose?\n4. The only way here is to list all server_groups info, and filter their membership using vm's uuid.\n5. More and more workloads will be increased if environment has much more server_groups. \n\n----------------\nSo, we need to add one item like 'server_group' in 'DescribeInstance()'s response IMO.\nThe server_group info is already stored in db. We only need to feedback the relationship of instance and server_group via the API.\n\nIn this case, the step above can be simplified into one step:\n\n1. Execute 'DescirbeInstance()' to get the server_group's uuid.",
