These could then be used wherever there was a need for 'EC2_CERT' and 'EC2_PRIVATE_KEY' respectively.\n\nIn EC2, almost everything has moved to using the REST api, which does authentication via secret key and access key.  The one set of tools that still needs the cert and private key path is the ec2-api-tools.  The only functionality that i'm aware of that *depends* on those is bundle-image (ec2-bundle-image, euca-bundle-image).\n\nIn a openstack system set up to use keystone, there is no way to get certificate and private key, and thus no way to publish an image via the bundle-image/upload-bundle path.",
