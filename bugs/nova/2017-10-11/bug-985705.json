    "description": "If an instance failed to build and is left in ERROR, then a subsequent delete in the xenapi driver will result in this error and instance fault:\n\nCould not find VM by name\n\nThis is because the destroy method was changed to raise an exception if the instance couldn't be found on the xen server. It should be changed back to be more tolerant of that kind of failure.",
