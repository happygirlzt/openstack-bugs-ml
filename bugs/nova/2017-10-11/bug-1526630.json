            "content": "I still can't reproduce the error with an up-to-date devstack installation. I seems to me that you should not get that error with that version of python-novaclient, because IP address validation is performed by the client itself. Below is a part of the output for a similar nova command:\n\nnova --debug boot --flavor 1 --image 6f5eafed-f9ec-44ba-a926-2be00289ab21 --nic net-id=5d67c691-73eb-4e9c-809c-1b4b12fd0b8f,v4-fixed-ip=1.0.0.087 invalid-ip-test > ~/nova-boot-debug 2>&1\n\nDEBUG (shell:894) Invalid ipv4 address.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient/shell.py\", line 892, in main\n    OpenStackComputeShell().main(argv)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient/shell.py\", line 819, in main\n    args.func(self.cs, args)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient/v2/shell.py\", line 546, in do_boot\n    boot_args, boot_kwargs = _boot(cs, args)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient/v2/shell.py\", line 294, in _boot\n    raise exceptions.CommandError(_(\"Invalid ipv4 address.\"))\nCommandError: Invalid ipv4 address.\nERROR (CommandError): Invalid ipv4 address.\n\nIf I run run novaclient with python debugger and place a breakpoint in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/novaclient/v2/shell.py on line 292 I can pinpoint where the IP gets validated:\n\n292 B->         if nic_info['v4-fixed-ip'] and not netutils.is_valid_ipv4(\n293                     nic_info['v4-fixed-ip']):\n294                 raise exceptions.CommandError(_(\"Invalid ipv4 address.\"))\n\nSo the validation you pointed out to in your report is there. However, I have no idea why you are still getting that response with that installation.  My only suggestion at this stage would be to recheck your installation and the occurrence of the misleading response. The reason is that IP validation for novaclient was introduced with version 3.2.0, which you have installed. A fix was released for a report [1] of similar nature, it is about ipv4 and ipv6 address correctness not being checked. The corresponding fix[2] is also useful for checking whether an octal IP address is valid.\n\nTo summarize, with an up-to-date installation of devstack, which comes with novaclient >= 3.2.0 you shouldn't get such a response, regardless of the version of your nova installation. Therefore I am willing to close this bug if you are content with these findings.\n\n[1]: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1528455\n[2]: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/260901/",
