This means that in the following case the resulting aggregates will be wrong:\n\n* create an rp with a known uuid (this is allowed and expected)\n* associate some aggregates (a, b, c)\n* delete the rp\n* recreate the rp with same uuid\n* query the associated aggregates get 'a, b, c' but expect []\n\nNote that the set_aggregates functionality (and the associated PUT API) is a full replace so any time the associated aggregates are updated, the input in that request becomes the whole set of associated aggregates. This bug is only present in the case where aggregates were present on the previous incarnation of a resource provider but should not be on the current incarnation.",
