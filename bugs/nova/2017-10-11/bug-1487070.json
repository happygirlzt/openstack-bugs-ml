The NUMA memory bandwidth monitor is the next\n    monitor namespace to be proposed, and this code sets up that patch\n    series.\n    \n    DocImpact: This patch provides the infrastructure for non-CPU compute\n    monitors to be loaded properly by the stevedore extension manager. The\n    CONF.compute_monitors configuration option previously supported only CPU\n    monitors, and so the format of the configuration option (which is a\n    multi-list option) looked like this: CONF.compute_monitors = ['virt_driver'],\n    which could be read as \"Use the virt_driver CPU monitor\". Now, non-CPU\n    monitors can be loaded by the extension manager, and so a namespace\n    prefix is also considered. For example, setting CPU.compute_monitors to\n    ['cpu.virt_driver', 'numa_mem_bw.virt_driver'] would allow the loading\n    of both the virt_driver CPU monitor and the virt_driver NUMA memory\n    bandwidth monitor. To preserve backwards compatibility, if there is no\n    namespace given, the 'cpu.' namespace is assumed.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1487070\n    Change-Id: I7ad45d5c5d617625b76cc79a65f8c185a24c79b6\n",
