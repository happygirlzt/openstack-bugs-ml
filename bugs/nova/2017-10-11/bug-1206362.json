    "description": "When we boot VM with QCOW2 which virtual size of the QCOW2 is larger than flavor's root disk size, boot fails with Error( /opt/stack/data/nova/instances/_base/instanceID virtual size larger than flavor root disk size xxxxxxxxxx). This behavior is right( This patch is bug #1177830 ).\n\nBut we cannot know virtual size in the log and cannot select suitable flavor. We must command 'qemu-img info image-path' on machine hosted image for knowing it.\n\nSo virtual size of the QCOW2 should be logged when flavor's root disk size < virtual size of the QCOW2. \n(e.g. /opt/stack/data/nova/instances/_base/instanceID virtual size yyyyyyyyyyyy larger than flavor root disk size xxxxxxxxx )",
