    "description": "Currently, when we evacuate an instance, evacuation mechanism checks only if nova-compute is down on failed host. If nova compute fails and vm's are still alive, we still can perform evacuation, but 2 separate vms will write to same disk, and that might break data integrity on disk. There should be better host health monitoring, which will give us better hint if we can perform safe evacuation.",
