Because there is no support for that in openstack to display username/ VM owner name right now. (as evident from the comments on my blueprint)\n\nOur use cases are similar in the sense that, we both are trying to convert UUID to Display name.\n\nIt works for VM UUID <-> VM display name right now, because, nova-client does a servers/detail call to the nova-api, and api returns all the information about al the VMs. After that, its just json parsing at the client side, that fetches the mapping from the json. Currently there is no call to nova-api that returns both, user uuid and username (or tenant uuid/tenant name). Its mainly because that information is maintained by keystone rather than nova-api.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
