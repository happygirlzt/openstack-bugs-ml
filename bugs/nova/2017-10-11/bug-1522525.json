Some older platforms, with an older version of openssl (older\n    than 1.0.1) do not support SHA-2 hashes.\n    \n    This patch skips the signature verification unit tests that require\n    SHA-2 support on systems that do not have SHA-2 support.  It also\n    catches the UnsupportedAlgorithm exception that is generated when a\n    system that does not have SHA-2 support tries to verify the signature,\n    providing better feedback to the user.\n    \n    Change-Id: I11b2366e96d49a5d502d6fccb0b6f620eb6c381d\n    Closes-Bug: 1522525\n",
