Unfortunately, the processing was broken for some\n    methods.  It would claim to be sending a '3.0' message, but would\n    be sending some of the arguments in an old format, causing some\n    methods to break when processed on the remote end.\n    \n    This patch fixes up the logic to ensure that if messages are sent as\n    '3.0', that the format of the data sent in the message matches.\n    \n    Note that this is a stable/havana specific change.\n    \n    Change-Id: I54135effe4e083f73cb7d912ac9e82fd182e2b2d\n    Closes-bug: #1301436\n",
