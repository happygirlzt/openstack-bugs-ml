The comment\n    in create_shadow_table() in nova/db/sqlalchemy/utils.py\n    which states that BigInteger isn't supported by SQLite\n    is not correct.  SQLite has an \"affinity\"-based,\n    dynamic typing model [1] that allows virtually any\n    name to be used for a type; datatypes are actually\n    determined on a row-by-row basis, but any\n    type name that has the substring INT inside of it\n    is automatically given integer affinity by default,\n    so there is no limitation on this type.\n    \n    There is one difference on SQLite between INTEGER\n    and BIGINT, and that is that SQLite's \"rowid\"\n    feature only takes effect for a primary key column\n    if it is named \"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\" [2].  However,\n    as all tests pass here it does not seem to be the\n    case that we are using BigInteger primary keys\n    in tests, and if we were, I'd rather approach SQLite's\n    quirk here in a different way.\n    \n    Note that this patch relies upon the assumption\n    that **SQLite is only used in Nova as a test database,\n    not in actual deployments**.  If this statement is\n    not true, then information on these other use cases\n    will be needed.\n    \n    Due to Alembic issue #341 [3] which has been resolved\n    for version 0.8.4 [4], the comparison of\n    INTEGER/BIGINT/SMALLINT is now significant by default,\n    so this change (or alternatively, one that changes Nova's\n    type comparison rules within migration tests) is needed\n    in order for Nova to pass the test_migrations test; the\n    error condition that raises with the latest Alembic is\n    shown in [5].\n    \n    [1] http://sqlite.org/datatype3.html\n    \n    [2] http://sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid\n    \n    [3] https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/issues/341/integer-vs-biginteger-diffrence-are-not\n    \n    [4] http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/changelog.html#change-f8a974100f54b74d7f90ef765edae1ed\n    \n    [5] http://paste.openstack.org/show/480966/\n    \n    (cherry picked from commit 793f4b7c711236f50dbebd8739f08604bff0af14)\n    \n    Item #2:\n    \n    Block requests 2.9.0\n    \n    Breaks the wsgi IPv6 unit tests.\n    \n    Depends-On: Ifb080c72a16ed4b93040fb7c06bdc072b7247f6e\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1526413\n    (cherry picked from commit ba82e4a875f01bb883deb78517953989b690a36c)\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia9f2d403e644651b6cd9bbf257ed94d257b2a1db\n",
