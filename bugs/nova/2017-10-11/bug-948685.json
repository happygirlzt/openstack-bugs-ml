    "description": "The proxy_token behavior is no longer working with keystone. Keystone even took out the functionality all together. Ive re-added the functionality to keystone via (https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/948439). In doing this, it changes the expected behavior of how novaclient should work. novaclient will need updating to be able to work with it. Ive got a fix that will rename token to proxy_token everywhere, since thats how its used anyway, and add the proxy_tenant_id so that it will work together in happiness.",

Ill talk w/ the keystone devs to see if we can change the belongs_to validation from the above bug to depend on tenant name instead of id.",

            "content": "ok thinking more on this it should be fine as is. When keystone started using tenantIDs then moved back to tenantName, yall didnt change the python novaclients' projectid field. its the same here, it will be the name (hopefully) eventually but for now its the id. Even if it switches to name, we dont have to rename it persay. So there is nothing left to do, just to wait for keystone :D",
