This makes it difficult to figure out if the method call succeeded or not.\n\nA better solution would be to:\na) log the exception in the errback before returning it.\nand\nb) return it separately from the result of the method.\n  It would be great if the receive code could actually unpack the message, and reraise an exception if one was hit, or else unpack the result and return it so client code doesn't have to do manual checking on the dictionary and look for 'result'",
