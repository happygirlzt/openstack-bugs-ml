The solution is a simple one-liner: to add @synchronized for the enable_dhcp method so that it cannot be run simultaneously for two VMs.  \n\ndiff --git a/nova/network/quantum/manager.py b/nova/network/quantum/manager.py\nindex b433652..4fc6f37 100644\n--- a/nova/network/quantum/manager.py\n+++ b/nova/network/quantum/manager.py\n@@ -364,6 +364,7 @@ class QuantumManager(manager.FloatingIP, manager.FlatManager):\n                                          instance['uuid'],\n                                          instance_type_id, host)\n \n+    @utils.synchronized('quantum-enable-dhcp')\n     def enable_dhcp(self, context, quantum_net_id, network_ref, vif_rec,\n             project_id):\n         LOG.info(\"Using DHCP for network: %s\" % network_ref['label'])",
