The Hudson agent will be\nresponsible for pulling lp:nova and installing all the necessary\npieces on the machines in your test environment\n* Place a /etc/nova/nova.conf file on the machines in question that\nmatches your target environment\n* Create a simple functional test script that runs through a basic set\nof API requests that exercise the parts of the Nova API that are\ncritical to you (XenAPI, Glance integration, etc)\n* Have Hudson fire said script against the test environment after\nstarting up Nova on the relevant nodes",
