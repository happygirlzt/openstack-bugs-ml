Currently, the glance client is packaged with the server, and they're pretty intertwined.  However, there is discussion on the mailing list right now about splitting all the clients out to address this issue.\n\nAnd yes, glance's client is defined as V1Client; but if you look at the very bottom of glance/client.py, you'll see \"Client = V1Client\"; I'm not sure exactly when this went in, but this shouldn't be an issue\u2026",

The old client is deprecated\n    in Folsom and should not be used in conjunction with\n    python-glanceclient.\n    \n    This removes the dependency on installing 'glance' through pip.\n    \n    Implements bp integrate-python-glanceclient\n    Fixes bug 880964\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifb9e75593abd36a2d1c08773d02f192e5e5627fc\n",
