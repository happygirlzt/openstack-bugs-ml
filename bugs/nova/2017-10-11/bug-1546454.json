Users running 6.0.0 are going to run into this problem for sure, irrespective of the Glance backend, because I've tested multiple options there.\n\nConsidering the low impact of the change and the severity of the issue, @sdague, why was this rejected?  It was also downgraded to Medium???  Seems to me this is critical to the vSphere driver that is included with Nova.\n\nAs an operator, I don't understand how these fixes can be downgraded or rejected without any sort of reasoning why.  Perhaps someone from the community can clarify?",
