    "description": "Pip 1.5 (released January 2nd, 2014) will by default refuse to download packages which are linked from PyPI but not hosted on pypi.python.org. The workaround is to whitelist these package names individually with both the --allow-external and --allow-insecure options.\n\nThese options are new in pip 1.4, so encoding them will break for people trying to use pip 1.3.x or earlier. Those earlier versions of pip are not secure anyway since they don't connect via HTTPS with host certificate validation, so we should be encouraging people to use 1.4 and later anyway.\n\nThe --allow-insecure option is transitioning to a clearer --allow-unverified option name starting with 1.5, but the new form does not work with pip before 1.5 so we should use the old version for now to allow people to transition gracefully. The --allow-insecure form won't be removed until at least pip 1.7 according to comments in the source code.\n\nVirtualenv 1.11 (released the same day) bundles pip 1.5 by default, and so requires these workarounds when using requirements external to PyPI. Be aware that 1.11 is broken for projects using sitepackages=True in their tox.ini. The fix is https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/commit/a6ca6f4 which is slated to appear in 1.11.1 (no ETA available). We've worked around it on our test infrastructure with https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config/commit/?id=20cd18a for now, but that is hiding the external-packages issue since we're currently running all tests with pip 1.4.1 as a result.\n\nThis bug will also be invisible in our test infrastructure for projects listed as having the PyPI mirror enforced in openstack/requirements (except for jobs which bypass the mirror, such as those for requirements changes), since our update jobs will pull in and mirror external packages and pip sees the mirror as being PyPI itself in that situation.\n\nWe'll use this bug to track necessary whitelist updates to tox.ini and test scripts.",

This\n    is done as part of the new pip-and-virtualenv element. All elements that\n    need pip or virtualenv should use this element to install them.\n    \n    Our motivation is that we need to talk to a pypi mirror generated with\n    a recent http://github.com/openstack-infra/pypi-mirror This mirror\n    caches some 'wheels' that the previous version of pip & virtualenv\n    can't install.\n    \n    virtualenv contains its own version of pip that is used for all\n    virtualenv environments.\n    \n    Change-Id: I282fd8fffc8d5707a078f78f2b4571138d7266f3\n\nWhich was released first in tripleo-image-elements 0.6.4",
