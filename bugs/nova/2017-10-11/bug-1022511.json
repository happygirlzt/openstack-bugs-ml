IMHO, that is a separate logical operation, that you may choose to use /in conjunction with/ one of the data-wiping operations, not instead of.\n\nWhether wiping the start of the device is useful depends somewhat of what the guest OS has used it for.  If the guest used it for a plain filesystem, then wiping will scramble much fo the filesystem metadat, but not the real data. So it is at best \"Security through obscurity\". If, however, the guest had put something like LUKS encryption on the volume, then wiping the start will blow away all the decryption key sots, so this will be as secure as any other method.",

Not sure what Duncan was envisioning when he stated \"cinder level\" but the driver level gives everybody the flexibility that's needed.\n\nI'm actually most interested in something \"faster\" like an \"unsecure-delete\" option.  The dd method implemented today is pretty effective, but for those truly paranoid implementing an option to specify \"shred\" might be worthwhile.\n\nOne other thing to consider, would it be better to leave this out of flags and just have an optional delete-type as an arg to the delete command?  This way an end user can choose what's appropriate and what's not, and a service provider admin can use flags to enable/disable this ability for their end-users?  At this point maybe we're getting out of the scope of Folsom.... thoughts?",

Currently this defaults to 3 passes.\n    \n    size_in_MiB can be used to limit the cleared area to the first\n    part of the volume, which can greatly speed up the operation,\n    and can be useful with encrypted volumes for example where\n    overwritting the encryption keys at the start is sufficient.\n    \n    Fixes bug: 1022511\n    Change-Id: I7312678ff5d66156578501483a1b74e2a69e19a0\n",
