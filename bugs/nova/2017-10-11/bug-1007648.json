This could be used for debugging transactional issues (my current focus), or other debugging tasks. It could also be aggregated by pt-query-digest to analyze database activity coming from different sections of the nova code.\n\nThis can be done by monkey-patching the database driver when the sql_connection_debug option is set at a certain level.",

This is especially powerful when combined\n    with pt-query-digest to get per-file or per-method aggregates.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ieda5cf4d70cc2643d27fb00efb48de14ca2abe52\n",
