The request happens asynchronously so there's no indication to Horizon of what happened. Ideally we would get the async response, but prior to sending that response the volume's record would change the status to \"detaching\" or something of the sort.\n\nFor now Horizon can slightly change the verb to make things clearer, but the larger fix here isn't something unilateral.",
