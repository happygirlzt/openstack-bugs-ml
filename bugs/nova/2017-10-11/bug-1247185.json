Even when using the '-s' option in RHEL 6.4, nova was extracting an snapshot from the image instead of doing it from an snapshot. This was working properly because  nova stops the instance before taking the snapshot so there is no danger on making a copy directly from the image instead of first doing an internal snapshot.\n\nBug 1242819 proposes the removal of this extra steps (create, extract and delete an internal snapshot) for libvirt, check the proposed patch for a more detailed explanation.",

If the guest -- based on which snapshot is to be taken -- is running, nova calls libvirt\u2019s virsh managedsave, which saves and stops a running guest, to be restarted later from the saved state.\n\n  2. Next, it creates a qcow2 internal disk snapshot of the guest (now  offline).\n\n  3. Then, extracts the internal named snapshot from the qcow2 file & exports it to a RAW format and temporarily places in   $instances_path/snapshots.\n\n  4. Deletes the internal named snapshot from the qcow2 file.\n\n  5. Finally, uploads that image into OpenStack glance service \u2014 which can be confirmed by running glance image-list.\n\n\n[*] http://kashyapc.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/openstack-nova-image-create-under-the-hood/\n\n",
