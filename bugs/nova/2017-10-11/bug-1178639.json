This code can probably be removed.\n\nThere look to be similar issues with the kernel and ramdisk.\n\nThe solution appears to be that each function should either create the disk, or throw an exception, (i.e. if there are any resources created during those functions, they should correctly clean themselves up).\n\nHowever the cases above are quite rare, and are mostly due to non-user trigger-able errors.",
