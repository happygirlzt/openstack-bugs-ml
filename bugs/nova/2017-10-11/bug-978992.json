Remove it.\n    \n    Note: In order to get unit tests to pass I had to add in\n    a temporary dependency on httplib2. This is due to the fact\n    that pip installing glance does not properly setup all\n    the dependencies. See LP Bug #975483 for details.\n    \n    Fixes LP Bug #978992.\n    \n    Change-Id: I50c00139f9dc303223601230fd962abac977cd5e\n",
