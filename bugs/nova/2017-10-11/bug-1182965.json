Only a user\n    with admin privileges is allowed to make this call.\n    \n    Allowing the administrators to be able to list and get details of keypairs\n    which owned by users other than themselves, as well as creating new and\n    deleting keypairs on behalf of their users.\n    \n    DocImpact: This adds API microversion\n    Implements blueprint admin-query-any-keypair\n    APIImpact\n    UpgradeImpact: Policy rules of the index, create, delete and show\n                   operations has been updated to support the change.\n                   os_compute_api:os-keypairs:{index, show, create, delete}:\n                   \"rule:admin_api or user_id:%(user_id)s\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Radez <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: #1182965\n    Change-Id: I45846f770628e8f24a8c137dcdc46baa64c50801\n",
