After dirty hacking host_filter.py and adding a split on the if condition \" if filter_class.__name__ == filter_name.split(\".\")[3]: \" we manage to move on.  But since host capabilities gathering for each compute node on KVM, was not implemented on Diablo, we moved onto E-3. \n\nWe attach the patch also, for those wo need this working on Diablo (maybe on Xen)\n\nPatch attached",
