I use mysql.\n\nThe method of InstanceList.get_by_host rasie rpc timeout error when ComputeManager.init_host() and _sync_power_states periodic task execute.\n\nLooks like a performance issue. currently, one nova-compute host map to the whole VMware deployment that maybe contain several clusters in nova VMware driver. When InstanceList.get_by_host execute in ComputeManager, it indicate that nova-compute will execute a rpc call to nova-conducutor, nova-conductor will fetch a lots of instances in the whole VMware deployment in once, in my case , it's 3000 instances. The long time SQL query maybe lead to the nova-conductor rpc timeout.\n\nPS: \nvSphere 5.1 now allows 100 hosts and 3000 powered on VMs.\nvSphere 6 now allows 1000 hosts and 10,000 powered on VMs.",
