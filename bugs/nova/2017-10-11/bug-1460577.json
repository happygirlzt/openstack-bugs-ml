Try to start instance.\n\nExpected behaviour: instance starts  in resize_confirm state\nActual behaviour: ERROR (Conflict): Instance d0e9bc6b-0544-410f-ba96-b0b78ce18828 in vm_state resized. Cannot start while the instance is in this state. (HTTP 409)\n\nRationale:\n\nIf tenant is resizing running instance, he can log into instance after reboot and see if resize was successful or not.  If tenant stopped instance before resize, he has no ability to check if instance resized successfully or not before confirming migration.\n\nProposed solution: Allow to start instance in the state 'resize_confirm + stopped'.\n\n(Btw: I'd like to allow to stop/start instances in  resize_confirm state, because tenant may wish to reboot/stop/start instance few times before deciding that migration was successful).",
