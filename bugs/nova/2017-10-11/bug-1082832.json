My best guess is that the 'quantum' service user you created is not an admin user.  Having this users as an admis is required, as it must be able to search across all ports in the system.

I'm currently using LDAP as the identity backend for keystone and I've used different role/tenant names than the default one (ex, os-admin vs. admin and os-service vs service) It seems like some of the default names are hard coded, but not sure where. As soon as I renamed my role and tenant names to the default ones - it worked! I wish this was better documented...sigh! At any rate - thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",
