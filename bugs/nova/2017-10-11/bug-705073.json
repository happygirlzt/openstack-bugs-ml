It isn't a huge burden to have them initialize the database as well,  and it might prevent some misconfiguration.  The current approach we are using for testing at anso is to have the packaging not start the services by default (via a setting /etc/default/nova-common), so a user would be responsible for creating the db and then enabling and running the services.  This is a bit of extra work, but it ensures services aren't trampling on each other and creating databases silently.\n\nVish\n\nOn Jan 19, 2011, at 11:25 AM, Thierry Carrez wrote:\n\n> Public bug reported:\n> \n> Looks like we now need to run manually \"nova-manage db sync\" to\n> initially create the database.

You are right that one way to fix it is to *not* start services at install-time and document the need to initialize the DB. That can be done using some START=0 in /etc/default/nova that the upstart jobs would source.\r\n\r\nThat's not the Debian way though: if possible, we should just initialize a local DB (in the debian maintainer scripts in packaging) and start the services.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, we need to change the way it currently works :)",

A separate project sounds a bit overkill... So far I've been opening two tasks, but maybe we should just keep it in Nova with a specific official tag. ]",
