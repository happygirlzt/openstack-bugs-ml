Found that test_floating_ip_disassociate would\n    actually fail the test if status_int was caught. Adding the\n    get_instance_by_floating_ip_addr stub to to the disassociate test\n    to return the test instance on IP match. This is required because\n    get_instance_by_floating_ip_addr is stubbed in setup to return None.\n    Fixes bug 1039432.\n    \n    Also making a minor change in test_bad_param_in_remove_floating_ip\n    which should call _remove_floating_ip rather than _add_floating_ip.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id43f785bb0e6b7405e2d292292c4126d7ed656cb\n",
