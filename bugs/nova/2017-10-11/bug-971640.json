This does not allow the uesrs to pull their own keys from a metadata service or from a script. This option is disabled by default.\n\n** Development Fix **\n\nThis issue was resolved in the latest development release in: https://review.openstack.org/6092\n\n** Stable Fix **\n\nThis issue was resolve in the stable release in: https://review.openstack.org/6830\n\n*** Test Case **\n\n1. Launch instance\n2. Check to see if there is ssh keys in /root/.ssh\n3. Set \"libvirt_inject_key=False\" in /etc/nova/nova.conf\n4. Restart /etc/nova/nova.conf\n5. Launch instance\n6. Check to see if there is ssh keys in /root/.ssh\n\n** Regression Potential **\n\nDisabling ssh keys inject is turned off by default, so there is minimal regression potential.",
