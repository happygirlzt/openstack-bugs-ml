    "description": "in case a user create direct port with binding-profile such as:\n --binding-profile '{\"capabilities\": [\"switchdev\"]}'. nova-compute will \noverwrite that info with the pci_vendor_info pci_slot which are used for the SR-IOV mechanism driver and agent, and on delete it will clear the binding:profile. \n\nThis change is important to OVS hardware-offload, because we distinguish between legacy SR-IOV to switchdev SR-IOV with the {\"capabilities\": [\"switchdev\"]} in the port profile. And with this info we know what mechanism driver will bind the direct port. {\"capabilities\": [\"switchdev\"]} - will bound by the OVS and all the others will be bound by SR-IOV mechanism driver",
