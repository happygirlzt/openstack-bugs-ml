This patch \"learns\" which storage is\n    shared, and then decides what base images are in use anywhere\n    on the set of compute nodes which share that base storage.\n    \n    This is complicated because shared instance storage doesn't have\n    to be per-cluster. It could for example be per rack. We need to\n    handle that properly.\n    \n    This should resolve bug 1078594.\n    \n    Change-Id: I36d0d6e965b114bb68c8f7b7fd43f8e96b2dd8f5\n",
