As the config was loaded, this caused the\n    list to be nested within a list.\n    \n    The non_inheritable_image_properties help also gave\n    an example in python list format when it should be\n    a comma-separated list.\n    \n    Updated the help to show that the compute_monitors\n    and non_inheritable_image_properties driver settings\n    should be provided in a comma delimited format if\n    multiple values are provided.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie07892cfde90d1679e941611e1dfbf0c011e1d1b\n    Closes-Bug: #1693923\n",
