Are you trying to launch 100 large or xlarge instances?\n\nIf it's the second one, then the '800' value comes from the fact that xlarge flavor consist of 8VCPUs. Then, if you are using this flavor for the 100 instances, you are trying to allocate 800 VCPUs.\n\nI guess that it calculates how many VCPUs you can use (20 in this case) and if the amount you are asking for exceeds the max, it just notify you about it.\n\nTry launching a few (let's say... 2) small instances first, just to use some VCPUs, and then launch the 100 xlarge instances again. The error message now should say something like \"Error: Quota exceeded for cores,instances,ram: Requested 800, but already used 2 of 20 cores\". Does that happen?\n\nProbably we could get a better message though.",
