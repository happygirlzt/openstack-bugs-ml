    "description": "Accidentally reported this for Glance, re-reporting it for Nova :)\n\n\n\nIt looks like revno 711 introduced some issues related to logging under Mac OS X. Looks like it breaks down into 3 issues:\n\n1. Syslog not respected (Fixed by termie in https://code.launchpad.net/~termie/nova/conditional_syslog/+merge/50847)\n\n2. Run_tests.sh just plain hangs\n\n3. Multiprocessing does not play well with logger. Somehow 711 seems to be indirectly tripping this issue. See http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/issues/detail?id=18 for root cause.\n\n\nProposal:\n\n\nThe current proposal is to revert 711 until we can work the kinks out of it. Any objections?",

Somehow 711 seems to be indirectly tripping this issue.

Since we aren't using multiprocessing I removed it from the debug output.  I suspect that 711 didn't actaully create the bug, but the error was just getting eaten somewhere. fix here:\n\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/~vishvananda/nova/lp723967\n\n",
