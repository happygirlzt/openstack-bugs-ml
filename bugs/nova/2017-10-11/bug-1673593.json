OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:host - The host name. Appears in the response for administrative users only.\n3. OS-EXT-SRV-ATTR:hypervisor_hostname - The hypervisor host name. Appears in the response for administrative users only.\n\nThe hostId is an obfuscated id for the hostname in the guest (server instance).\n\nThe 'host' is the name of the compute host that the nova-compute service is running on. This comes from the 'host' configuration option value in nova.conf.\n\nThe 'hypervisor_hostname' is the hostname of the hypervisor, provided by the compute driver, which in most cases is the same as 'host' *except* in the case of Ironic in which case it's the Ironic node name.",
