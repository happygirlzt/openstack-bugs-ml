To be clear, NIC ordering on a VM can sometimes be undeterministic depending on the OS.\n\nFor that precise reason, a new feature recently merged in Newton about allowing NICs to be tagged :\nhttps://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/newton/implemented/virt-device-role-tagging.html\n\nThat way, you can query the metadata service in order to know which NIC is corresponding to which port/network you passed.\n\nSee https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=create-server-detail and lookup for the 'networks' parameter, you'll see mentioned a 'tag' attribute that is available since 2.32 API microversion.\n\nClosing the bug as WontFix since the community agreed on that direction.",
