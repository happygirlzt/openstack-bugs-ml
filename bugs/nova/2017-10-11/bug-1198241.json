Specifically, in the section below on tag filters:\n\n\n\"tag-key\n\n    The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter \"tag-key=Purpose\" and the filter \"tag-value=X\", you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key filter.\n\ntag-value\n\n    The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.\n\n    Type: String\n\"\n",
