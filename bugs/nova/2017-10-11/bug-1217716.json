Normally how long does it take for you to boot the instance? How do you allocate the nova-compute and ESX host? Do you install them on the same physical machine? For my configuration,  nova-compute and ESX host are not on the same macine but in the same LAN. I look forward to your reply.\r\nThank you very much.\r\n",

            "content": "Hi Vincent,\n\nThe first time you boot a VM from an image, it needs to be copied from glance over to your vCenter datastore.  This can take a long time, especially if you have a slow network connection between glance + your vcenter.  \n\nAll future VM boots using the same glance image is much faster, as the image is already copied to the datastore.  \n\nThe root cause of your original \"operating system not found\" error is likely that you are using the wrong vmware_adaptertype metadata when creating the image.  See the instructions for \"Images for VMware vsphere\" section of http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/vmware.html",
