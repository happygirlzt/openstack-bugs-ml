    "description": "There are a couple of cases in the compute manager where we don't pass reservations to _delete_instance().  For example, one of them is cleaning up when we see a delete that is stuck in DELETING.\n\nThe only place we ever update quotas as part of delete should be when the instance DB record is removed. If something is stuck in DELETING, it means that the quota was not updated.  We should make sure we're always updating the quota when the instance DB record is removed.\n\nSoft delete kinda throws a wrench in this, though, because I think you want soft deleted instances to not count against quotas -- yet their DB records will still exist. In this case, it seems we may have a race condition in _delete_instance() -> _complete_deletion() where if the instance somehow was SOFT_DELETED, quotas would have updated twice (once in soft_delete and once in _complete_deletion).",
