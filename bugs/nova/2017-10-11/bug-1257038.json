    "description": "Currently the VMware Nova Driver relies on the VM name in vCenter/ESX to match the UUID in Nova. The name can be easily edited by vCenter administrators and break Nova administration of VMs. A better solution should be found allowing the Nova Compute Driver for vSphere to look up VMs by a less volatile and publicly visible mechanism.\n\nEDIT:\nA fix would make the link between vSphere and Nova more solid and involve using a vSphere metadata value that cannot be easily edited. Currently the UUID is stored as an extra config metadata property inside vSphere (associated with the instance's virtual-machine) and\nthis value is not easy to accidentally change. That would make the link much more robust.",
