This is incorrect\n    and is a bug in the VMware driver, since the block devices\n    can be blank volumes.  We should be able to accept an image\n    and block device mappings in \"nova boot\".\n    \n    DocImpact: VMware supports nova boot with the --block-device\n    option.  End users can specify the block device's bus to be\n    either lsiLogic, busLogic, ide, lsiLogicsas, or paraVirtual.\n    For example, nova boot --flavor m1.tiny --block-device\n    source=image,dest=volume,size=1,id=<image_id>,bus=lsiLogicsas,\n    bootindex=0 test\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf59906b95bda560d2427c88a78b65c098825959\n    Closes-Bug: #1350224\n    Closes-Bug: #1271966\n",
