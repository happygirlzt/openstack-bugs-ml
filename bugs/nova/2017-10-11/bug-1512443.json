Can you re-create this issue on a more modern nova?\n\nThat said, copying the config drive to rbd is done with just a \"rbd --import\" in nova.virt.libvirt.storage.rbd_utils. There is a loop mount when the config drive is built if you're using the vfat format, but that is unmounted when we're done.\n\nCan you confirm if you're using vfat as your config drive format please?",
