            "content": "This bug is a more general issue which is a whole bunch of targeted moving operations don't go through the scheduler to validate the decision. This historically has been somewhat intentional, since these operations are reserved for admins who should know what they are doing. That being said it would be nice to have a mode for these targeted moves that validates the move with the scheduler.   I think this work will have to wait until L as we are trying to pull out the scheduler in Kilo.\n\nIn the meantime one possible improvement we can make is have a separate policy.json entry  (http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/etc/nova/policy.json) for targeted moves (evacuate/migrate etc).   So operators can choose to further restrict who has access to these operations (and even disable them).",

            "content": "I would rephrase ' 1. VMs in a server group with affinity rule can't be migrated' as \n'1. VMs in a server group with affinity rule can be migrated only with all other VMs in that affinity group that run on this host'\nThis would require support by the API and CLI tools for specifying multiple instances to be migrated at the same time. Without this migrating a server in an affinity rule will always fail.\n\nIt would be good to add an option to the boot command to disable a particular or all scheduling filters. But that should probably go as a separate ticket.",
