Basically, the volume got stuck in 'in-use' when it really wasnt.\n\nI suspect that what happened was this:\n * initial attach failed badly, leaving 'in-use'\n * the reboot (or possibly a timeout) kicked nova to re-evaluate the situation, and it recognized that the volume was not in-use.\n\nSo, i think the real issue is likely that the volume just got marked as in use, even though the libvirt (or something else) actually failed, and then it took something (timeout or reboot) to get back to sane state.",
