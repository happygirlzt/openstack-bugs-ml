Ideally, the important info will be passed in a message instead of the api calling the method.  Regardless, if we are going to continue to use Manager's in two modes (locally via python import, remotely via rpc and the Service class), we need to be careful about where we are loading additional objects like templates.\n\nThe init_host() method is for initialization that should only happen if the manager is run as a standalone service.  Perhaps we should move the hyperisor connection in ComputeManager to init_host() instead of __init__?  I think compute manager only needs to connect to the hypervisor when it is standalone.  This problem may also go away with the distributed data model.\n\nVish\nOn Nov 22, 2010, at 1:41 AM, Soren Hansen wrote:\n\n> Agreed.
