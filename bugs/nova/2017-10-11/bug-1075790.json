    "description": "If you try to add a network to project using the Network API extension and nova-network is not configured with VlanManager then the user gets an error message like:\n\n{\"badRequest\": {\"message\": \"Cannot associate network 60986c1f-8843-4f36-a514-ad856f8b5f16 with project dd0ddb48a8284ea79ea4fce9b9498c40: No such RPC function 'add_network_to_project'\", \"code\": 400}}\n\nThis is not very useful at all. I think we should instead catch this exception and return a message saying that this only works when VLAN support is enabled.",
