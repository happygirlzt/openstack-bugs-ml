The doc build requires oslo.sphinx, but oslo.sphinx is not included in requirements.txt (because oslo.sphinx is not needed to run nova).  It suffices to pip install oslo.sphinx; nova's test-requirements.txt includes oslo.sphinx, so an environment that also includes those items is good for doc building.  nova/doc/README.rst should be enhanced with such an explanation.\n\nThis bug was found in nova master pulled on Jan 2, 2014.",
