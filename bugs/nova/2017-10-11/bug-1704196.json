Openstack can handle this without error, but when the same vm is relocated once more to the volume's datastore it raises an error when detaching the volume.\n\nThis occurs because when they are in the same datastore, the _relocate_vmdk_volume inside the \"try\" section in the _consolidate_vmdk_volume function doesn't give an error, and the detach_disk_from_vm function will run with the destroy vmdk set to true, but the vmdk doesn't not exist, raising another error.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n- Attach a volume to an Instance\nIn Vcenter:\n- Migrate the Instance to a datastore\n- Migrate the Instance again to the volume's datastore\n- Try to detach the volume\n\nA possible fix is attached here.",

We handle this case during detach\n    volume by catching FileNotFoundException raised by shadow VM relocate\n    operation. The shadow VM relocate will be NOP if the source and the\n    destination datastores are the same. In this case, the subsequent\n    detach disk device from shadow VM will fail if the volume vmdk is\n    missing. Handling this case by catching and ignoring\n    FileNotFoundException raised by the detach operation.\n    \n    Change-Id: I33ad36b147f040364514d8097a1dfc363c50b0b7\n    Closes-Bug: #1704196\n    Co-Authored-By: <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: <email address hidden>\n",
