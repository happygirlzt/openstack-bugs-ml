See referenced bug\n    for details.\n    \n    In order to alleviate that confusion, this change does a few things:\n    1) Adds an explicit \"acquired\" message inside the lock so it is\n       clear when the lock was actually acquired.\n    2) Moves the release message inside the semaphore so there's no\n       chance of it being logged out of order.\n    3) Removes the \"Got semaphore\" message and splits it into two\n       separate messages depending on whether the semaphore was found\n       in the weakref dictionary.  Making it clear which code path\n       was followed should help with future debugging.\n    \n    This is the Nova port of oslo-incubator change\n    If863c9d3896bc786f3c9c46196ebb0766e57d863\n    \n    Change-Id: I530befb42a963a40e7d5bf8d4d81fc097e1cb309\n    Partial-Bug: #1367941\n",
