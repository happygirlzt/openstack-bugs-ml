The file should be auto-generated when we package using \"python setup.py sdist\" command. The .mailmap file, if exists, should be honored. This is applicable for all projects, swift, keystone, nova and glance.\n\nOnce this is resolved, we could remove the test, test_authors.py that check for an entry in AUTHORS file.",
