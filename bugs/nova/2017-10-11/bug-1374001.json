I noticed there aren't unit tests but I'm seeing if i can figure out how I can test it (not familiar with this script but wanted to help with bugs).\n\nI have got some code -- haven't yet sorted how to let the script choose to be insecure (and not verify cert) if it wants. I'll put a review up today and add you so you can let me know what to change. :)",
