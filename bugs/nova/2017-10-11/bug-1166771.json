Issue live-migration command without setting destination host to trigger scheduler host selection\n\nSince there is just one compute node in this setup (the source node), scheduling will return a NoValidHost exception.\n\nExpected behavior is for the instance task state to be reset to None, while the actual behavior is that it is left as MIGRATING.\n\nThe solution is to add this exception to the list of exceptions for which the instance state is reset on a failure.",
