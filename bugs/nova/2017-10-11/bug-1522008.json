    "description": "When node cleaning is not async (conductor starts cleaning immediately in do_node_tear_down()) Nova delete instance fails. Nova tries to update Ironic port (remove vif id), but conductor releases a lock only after thread with cleaning completed. Because cleaning usually is not a short time action Nova fails after retries. This bug can affects any out-of-tree driver, reproduced on Ansible deploy driver PoC ( https://review.openstack.org/#/c/238183/ ).",
