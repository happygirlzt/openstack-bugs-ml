In case the\n    instance is gone it will throw an unhandled InstanceNotFound exception.\n    \n    To properly handle this, move the call to _default_block_device_names()\n    inside the existing try block next to it that handles this exception.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3503029f02669e6ae31441653096fa69cba76d45\n    Closes-Bug: #1224677\n",
