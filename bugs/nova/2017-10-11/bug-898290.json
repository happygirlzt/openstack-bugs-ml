This means that we don't use volume's host identifier\n    (which could be an opaque ID) when trying to connect to the iSCSI target --\n    we use the admin-specified IP address instead.\n    \n    The string-join to set provider_location is shared with ZadaraBEDriver,\n    which was doing something similar.  I've brought that into a helper function.\n    \n    The docstring for the --host flag has been clarified.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8402da86345e786a46a4d222ad4d8a4449d2bd3f\n",
