This is because the downloaded image was\n    being directly dd'd onto the new LVM root, which will obviously not\n    work for any format other than RAW.\n    \n    Simple change to use qemu-img to read from the image (letting it\n    decide the format) and write to the LVM root as raw.\n    \n    Change-Id: I36494e6d0671c07f7511c10ef886c8cf84c18df7\n",
