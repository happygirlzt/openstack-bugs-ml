    "description": "VStorage share is mounted by fuse using vstorage-mount utility (pstorage-mount is symlink). This utility has the option to specify log file \"-l\". Currently default log path used by nova-compute is \"/var/lib/pstorage\". However when VStorage package is installed it creates \"/var/lib/vstorage\" instead. So this needs to be default value in nova.conf. Non-existent log path results in vstorage-mount fail like:\n\nCommand: sudo cinder-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf pstorage-mount -c mycluster -l /var/log/pstorage/nova-mycluster.log.gz -u nova -g root -m 0770 /var/lib/nova/mnt/a0836a988e84c4c0245d1ffa7cee4921\nExit code: 253\nStdout: u''\nStderr: u'19-05-17 16:28:52.719 failed to access directory /var/log/pstorage - No such file or directory\\n'",

So this should be a\n    default value for logging path.\n    Otherwise user is forced to create logging path manually,\n    because volume mount will fail.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1692026\n    Change-Id: If6be49dad553f7ad9a947ea56ce107f8d028d28a\n    Signed-off-by: Pavel Gluschak <email address hidden>\n",
