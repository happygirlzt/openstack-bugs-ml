Then i fount all of my vms` status change to deleting but cannot be deleted. I checked my openstack, the rabbitmq-server crashed . Then i restart rabbitmq-server and my openstack nova services, sended the delete requests again and again, the vms still cannot be deleted. While , in havana, the vms can be deleted if received duplicate delete requests . \nI think icehouse should handle duplicate delete requests like havana .",

When an instance task_state is already in\n    'deleting' state and if at that moment the rabbitmq-server get crashed\n    by some reasons, then the instance task_state remains in 'deleting'\n    state and user won't be able to delete the instance forever.\n    \n    At this moment, there is only one way to delete the instances, whose\n    task_state is in 'deleting' state, by restarting the nova-compute\n    services where these instances are running.\n    \n    To avoid restarting the nova-compute service manually, modified the\n    force-delete api to allow instance deletion irrespective of\n    instance task_state.\n    \n    Added new module to use delete_types as constants and replaced all\n    delete_type string occurances with new constants.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1308342\n    \n    Change-Id: I4d0e47662a80109ef9622d85455587d487e47c01\n",
