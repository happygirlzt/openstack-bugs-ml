The usage is:\n# nova add-fixed-ip <server> <network-id>\nthe second parameter is network-id not ip address.\n\nthere is nothing wrong with the add-fixed-ip command. \nHowever, there are really something wrong with this function. the virtual machine can only get one ip address through DHCP even you add multiple ip address to that virtual machine. From this perspective, we need to get nova-network/neutron to support multiple ip address on one port.",
