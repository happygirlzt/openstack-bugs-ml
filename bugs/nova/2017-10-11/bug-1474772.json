Memory or cpu, can only make the vm slower. \nBut PCI didn't support migrate because network_info didn't update pci slot info  in finish_resize function. PCI migrate should be done with a bp . \n\nBut this bug can fixed earlier.  \n\nA vm has migrated from Host A to Host B:\nin Host A, before update_available_resource is called, vm's uuid is recored in tracked_instances. And thenwe get a resize_confirm request, but the drop_move_claim failed to free resouces util next period task.\n\nwhen resize-revert is called, in host B migration's status is set to reverted first. \nAnd if period task update available resource is called in host A, instance's host is still B and migration is filter because statu changed, this vm's resource will be freed in host A,\nBefore next period task, if any other vm is created in host A, it might reuse the migrate vm's resource. If the resource can't be reused like hugepage/pci, one of these two vm will changed to ERROR.",
