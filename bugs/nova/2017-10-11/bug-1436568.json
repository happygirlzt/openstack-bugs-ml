If the instance have been already cleaned up in Ironic the\n    nova code should just ignore it and continue. This also skip trying to\n    update the node to remove the instance association if the instance was\n    already removed in Ironic.\n    \n    Missing unittests to the _unprovision() method were added as part of\n    this patch since it touches it.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1436568\n    Change-Id: I0b1b710056d48c8b7bb2b46fdaba192922926420\n",
