The result is the same as previously\n    occurred when vhost-net became prevalent in kvm guests.\n    \n    Software that expects the checksums on packets will ignore them.  One example\n    of such software is udhcpc in cirros.  Without this change, cirros containers\n    in 3.13 kernels (Ubuntu 14.04) will fail to acquire an address via dhcp.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1335193\n    Change-Id: Iba305fb7f8236955ca732e467db9e424535be93d\n",
