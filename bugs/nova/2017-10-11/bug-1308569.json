When looking at the cell logs, there are lots of different errors, some are for auth issues, some are for problems communicating with the child cell, etc.  I'm not sure what root cause there is, or if there are many different failures.\n\nWe should find something to fingerprint in here though so we can track a bug against it with elastic-recheck.",
