Could you provide more information about what you want to do with mkisofs that Nova doesn't currently support?\n",

Are you seeing errors or other problems when you set that to use mkisofs or anything else?\n\nFrom what I can tell, Nova itself doesn't actually have a hard-coded dependency on genisoimage (beyond suggesting it as a default image utility in the config). Do you have further information (beyond the grep results above) of how Nova is logically tightly coupled to genisoimage specifically?\n",
