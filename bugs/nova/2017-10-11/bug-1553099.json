This change adds a name parameter called\n    'include_disabled' which provides the caller with the option\n    of having disabled hosts returned too.\n    \n    This query is used by the scheduler to retrieve the list of\n    available hosts. The initial list should include disabled hosts.\n    The ComputeFilter removes disabled hosts so inclusion of this\n    filter is the proper way to exclude disabled hosts.  Excluding\n    disabled hosts from the initial list prevents the forcehost\n    feature from being used to place an instance on a disabled host.\n    \n    The query is only used in objects.ServiceList.get_by_binary which\n    is only called in one other place, in cells/state.py by\n    CellStateManager._get_compute_hosts. Adding the named parameter\n    to the get_by_binary method of the ServiceList class means the\n    behaviour of CellStateManager._get_compute_hosts will not be\n    impacted.\n    \n    Change-Id: I05c2716da45119e6e6aa272b0701be9ae098842c\n    Closes-Bug: #1553099\n",
