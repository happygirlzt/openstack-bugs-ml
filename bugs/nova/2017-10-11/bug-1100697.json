According to\n    the Xen documentation it can be enabled safely: \"In general you should\n    leave this enabled and allow the guest Operating System to choose whether\n    or not to use PAE. \" [1]\n    \n    [1] http://xenbits.xen.org/docs/unstable/man/xl.cfg.5.html#pae_boolean\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1100697\n    Change-Id: If8d8ebc38efd969d96a1953446d72e72691734b3\n",
