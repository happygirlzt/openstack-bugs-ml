To handle this, we cycle through all\n       block-device-mappings, not just the root-device, create the VDI, and\n       later, create the VBD.\n    \n    Small changes include:\n    \n    * Using `connection_data` instead of `dev_params` (to match other parts of\n      the code base)\n    \n    * Renaming `get_vdis_for_boot_from_vol` to `get_vdi_uuid_for_volume` to\n      reflect its more general and simpler semantics.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1071547\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie54a16be4bae2a718ed7d506f32777d0847b9089\n",
