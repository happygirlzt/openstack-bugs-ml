The linux_net driver\n    then executes dhcp_release, a binary that comes with dnsmasq that\n    releases a DHCP lease on the local host. Upon lease release, dnsmasq\n    calls its dhcp-script, nova-dhcpbridge. The latter calls\n    release_fixed_ip() and the instance's fixed IP is returned to the\n    pool. This is fine if an instance has never been live-migrated.\n    \n    If an instance has been live-migrated, the dnsmasq on its new\n    host fails with 'unknown lease' because it's not the same dnsmasq that\n    originally handed out the lease. Having failed, dnsmasq doesn't call\n    nova-dhcpbridge and release_fixed_ip() is never called. The fixed IP\n    is not returned to the pool and a new instance cannot be booted with\n    that IP.\n    \n    This patches adds a release_dhcp RPC call that calls release_dhcp on\n    the instance's \"original\" host, thus ensuring that the correct dnsmasq\n    handles the lease release and that nova-dhcpbridge and\n    release_fixed_ip() are called.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0eec8c995dd8cff50c37af83018697fc686fe727\n    Closes-bug: 1585601\n",
