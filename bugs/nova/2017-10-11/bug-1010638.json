    "description": "When OSAPI create() recieves a request for a new server, one of the first things it does is check to see if the flavorid given is valid. Recent changes have made it so that this check receives incorrect information in the form of deleted instance_types. Basically what is happening is:\n\n-Administrator creates flavor with name \"flavor1\" and flavorid \"1\"\n-Administrator marks  flavor with name \"flavor 1\" as deleted\n-Administrator creates flavor with name \"flavor1-redux\" and flavorid \"1\"\n\ninstance_types.get_instance_type_by_flavorid(\"1\") will now return \"flavor1\" instead of the non-deleted \"flavor1-redux\"",

In the case\n    of OSAPI create(), we explicitly do not want to query deleted flavors.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1010638\n    \n    Change-Id: I9c26c7130f8c3d6680143e36b4aaa1f662c682a7\n",
