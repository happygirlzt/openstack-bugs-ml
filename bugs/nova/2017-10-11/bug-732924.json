Instances, on the other hand specifically return a project as the owner (in a separate attribute at that):\n\n[ownerId] => testproject\n\nSimilarly, addresses also report the project as an owner:\n\n[instanceId] => i-00000002 (testproject)\n\nIt would be useful for volumes to return the owner as the project instead of the user. Alternatively, adding the project instead of replacing the user would work.\n\nIt would really be ideal for all resources to return an owner attribute, with the project as the value.",
