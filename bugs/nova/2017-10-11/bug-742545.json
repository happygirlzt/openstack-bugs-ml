This would provide a good place to add extended OS API features that are not part of the official spec but exist within the nova source code base. The core extension mechanism should probably provide a way to make core extensions optional such that they can also be disabled.",

I can understand the need for this kind of thing with something like /volumes that we want to check into Nova itself but we can certainly do this first (get it right) and then implement volumes to use it.\n\nI really prefer things to go into nova as individual features and not in one big chunk.\n\nIn the meantime I'd go for making volumes a 'user' extension which already works great. Just have people that want to use it drop the volumes extension .py file into /var/lib/nova/extensions.\n\nDan",
