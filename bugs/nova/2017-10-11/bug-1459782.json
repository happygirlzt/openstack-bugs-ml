Looks like that never happened.  That would fix the immediate issue raised in this bug.\n\nThere's a complication though.  In virt.libvirt.utils.copy_image() we also rely on passwordless authentication to do either \"rsync\" or \"scp\" to copy the image file over when doing cold migration with local storage.  So for the case of local storage we'd still need to set up passwordless ssh between compute nodes to handle cold migration.",
