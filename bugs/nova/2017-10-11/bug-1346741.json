Or, \"nova stop <server>\" is broken.\n\n\nI read this:\n\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/nova_cli_stop_start.html\n\nAnd this:\n\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/novaclient_commands.html\n\n\nAnd I an unable to figure out how to gracefully shutdown an Instance from Nova... It seems that OpenStack Nova is missing this one. \n\nThis is very odd...   :-/\n\nI found a command that is similar, called \"shelve\", which gracefully shuts down a Instance but, it also triggers a snapshot, which is not desired (when you just want to shut it down).\n\nSo, what can we do?!\n\nShould I fill a bug report at Nova?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nBest,\nThiago",

This new \"feature in nova\", that is required to make this \"Stop button\" to work, which is an `ACPI Call` called via libvirt at the Compute Node, needs to be applied to \"Terminate button\" too!\n\nI mean, currently, the \"Terminate button\" also does not gracefully shutdown an instance! It simple destroys it.\n\nThis is very bad, simple because lots of cloud providers (Like AWS EC2, RackSpace, etc) sends an `ACPI Call` to a instance that is about to be destroyed, this is the only way to trigger the famous \"decommissioning scripts\" within an instance, that is heavily used by Righscale, for example, and by my company.\n\nThe current implementation of Nova (libvirt), make it impossible to decommission an Instance! Because it is just destroyed (not gracefully halted), so, `init 0` is never triggered by the Linux guest S.O..\n\nSo, before \"Terminate\", and delete an Instance, Nova needs to first, send an `ACPI call` to trigger \"init 0\" on Linux instances, wait about 5 minutes to destroy (and delete) it, then, the decommissioning scripts will work.\n\nBest!\nThiago",
