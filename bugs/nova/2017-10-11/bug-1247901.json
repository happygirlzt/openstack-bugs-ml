The volumes were on LVM.  \n\nWe started seeing the attachments fail intermittently, after about an hour, with:\nraise exception.NotFound(_('Unable to find a mounted disk for '\n                                                     'target_iqn: %s') % target_iqn)\n\nThe person who has access to the system where this is happening is out on vacation right now.  So, I can't get you a pastebin right now.  I have a patch written up.  We ran with the patch for 7 hours without seeing the problem recreate.\n\nIs this type of patch the sort of thing you expect to have a unit test as well?",
