    "description": "Currently there is no way to get rid of a volume in an error state via the API. Attempting to do so yields the following message:\n\n\"Invalid volume: Volume status must be available (HTTP 400)\"\n\nReproducing this is fairly trivial:\n\n  1. Create a volume with a size arbitrarily larger than available storage space (e.g. 10000GB)\n\n  2. Wait for the creation to fail and leave the volume in an \"error\" state.\n\n  3. Using novaclient, attempt to send a delete request, e.g.: client.volumes.delete(volume_id)",
