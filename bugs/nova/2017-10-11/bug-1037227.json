    "description": "Bug 1037201 appears to have found a bug in the disk_config extension that has been around for a while. It doesn't check if the 'server' key exists before attempting to use it.\n\nThere is a unit test that checks that a 400 result code is returned, and it passes (mostly, see the aforementioned bug).\n\nIt mostly works because of other extensions (such as scheduler_hints) that might possibly check for the missing 'server' key before the disk_config extensions.\n\nExtensions should be checked independently to ensure that these sorts of bugs don't get hidden.",
