    "description": "[Impact]\n\nThere currently exists a race condition whereby the compute resource_tracker periodic task polls extant instances and checks their BDMs which can occur prior to any mappings having yet been created e.g. root disk mapping for new instances. This patch ensures that instances without any BDMs are skipped.\n\n[Test Case]\n\u00a0\u00a0* deploy Openstack Mitaka with debug logging enabled (not essential but helps)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* create an instance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* delete its BDMs - pastebin.ubuntu.com/24287419/\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* watch /var/log/nova/nova-compute.log on hypervisor hosting instance and wait for next resource_tracker tick\n\n\u00a0\u00a0* ensure that exception mentioned in LP does not occur (happens after \"Auditing locally available compute resources for node\")\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\nThe resource tracker information is used by the scheduler when deciding which compute hosts are able to have an instances scheduled to them. In this case the resource tracker would be skipping instances that would contribute to disk overcommit ratios. As such it is possible that that scheduler will have momentarily skewed information about resource consumption on that compute host until the next resource_tracker tick. Since the likelihood of this race condition occurring is hopefully slim and provided that users have a reasonable frequency for the resource_tracker, the likelihood of this becoming a long term problem is low since the issue will always be corrected by a subsequent tick (although if the compute host in question were saturated that would not be fixed until an instances was deleted or migrated).\n\n[Other]\nNote that this patch did not make it into upstream stable/mitaka branch due to the stable cutoff so the proposal is to carry in the archive (indefinitely).\n\n--------\n\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager [req-d5d5d486-b488-4429-bbb5-24c9f19ff2c0 - - - - -] Error updating resources for node controller.\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager Traceback (most recent call last):\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/compute/manager.py\", line 6726, in update_available_resource\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager     rt.update_available_resource(context)\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/compute/resource_tracker.py\", line 500, in update_available_resource\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager     resources = self.driver.get_available_resource(self.nodename)\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py\", line 5728, in get_available_resource\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager     disk_over_committed = self._get_disk_over_committed_size_total()\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager   File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py\", line 7397, in _get_disk_over_committed_size_total\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager     local_instances[guest.uuid], bdms[guest.uuid])\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager KeyError: '0a5c5743-9555-4dfd-b26e-198449ebeee5'\n2016-07-12 09:54:36.021 10056 ERROR nova.compute.manager",
