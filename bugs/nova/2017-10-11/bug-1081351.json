By assigning a 'node' field to the instance within the scheduler, the instance can be erroneously counted against that compute node's usage prior to actually verifying the claim in resource tracker.\n\nThis can come about if the update_available_resource audit process runs before the resource checks are actually made on the compute side.  If that happens, the compute_node will report usage for the instance even though it has not yet accepted the claim.",
