This change\n    saves the original vm_state and uses it to restore the state on the\n    instance after the resize is confirmed or rejected.\n    \n    With this change, the resize flow will never automatically power on an\n    instance that is originally shutoff. The user, however, can manually\n    power on the resized instance to test it before confirming or rejecting\n    the resize. If the user powered on the instance and confirmed the\n    resize, then this change will leave the instance active. If the user\n    powered on the instance and then rejected the resize, this change will\n    stop the instance when it finishes the revert operation.\n    \n    Related to bug 1177811\n    \n    Change-Id: I19fa61d467edd5a7572040d084824972569ef65a\n",
