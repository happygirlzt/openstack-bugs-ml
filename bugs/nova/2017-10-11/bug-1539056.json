Because the service information is contained within a child cell and not replicated to the api cell there is a requirement that child cells be available in order to respond to this query.\n\nThe challenge with fixing this is that there is no way to indicate in the API if a partial response is being provided.  So while I agree that it would be preferable to return a response rather than fail under these conditions it is not a good idea to return a partial list of service information.  For now you'll need to ensure that all cells services are running properly in order to keep the API fully functional.",
