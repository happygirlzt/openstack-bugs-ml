So the exception handling needs to be broadened\n\n(2) The fix for bug #1288049 (review https://review.openstack.org/#/c/78806) switched from copying each key to copying the whole dictionary, but with the fix, if deep copy fails, the entire dictionary is turned into unicode and can no longer be used for keyword replacement.  \n      In particular, when the unicode is passed it treats the unicode as an iterable, takes the first element and sees that it only has one element (it expects a key and value) so it returns: \" ValueError: dictionary update sequence element #0 has length 1; 2 is required\"\n      There are no test cases for the deep copy failure scenario.\n",
