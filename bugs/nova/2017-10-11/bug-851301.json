If local_gb == 0 (m1.tiny), then this check will let *anything* through.  \n\nnova/virt/libvirt/connection.py is consistent in its non-checking of any size for m1.tiny, but worse, it does it explicitly based on name ==  'm1.tiny'.\n\nComments like the following in manager.py indicate that 'local_gb' is actually supposed to be the size of the root disk, which seems to make more sense:\n             # NOTE(jk0): Since libvirt uses local_gb as a secondary drive, we\n            # need to handle potential situations where local_gb is 0. This is\n            # the default for m1.tiny.\n\nThe result of this is that in libvirt:\n * the root disk size is actually determined by the flag 'minimum_root_size' which defaults to 10GB.\n * [not verified with test] any image size can be run on an m1.tiny, the image will be neither resized up or down\n * [not verified with test] for all other types (where local_gb != 0) the image size is checked against 'local_gb', not against the size \n\n\nlibvirt needs to start using local_gb in an instance_type size to be the root disk, rather than ephemeral0.",
