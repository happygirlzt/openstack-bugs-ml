I will keep exploring how to repro.\nNote that the full tempest jobs are run daily and the database backend is Galera cluster.\n\n(On Horizon side, it brings bad user experience as the default page after login is affected, so a workaround to replace negative values in total*Used with 0 is under review and it will be backported to Icehouse.)",
