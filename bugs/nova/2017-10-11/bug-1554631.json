Nova currently only returns a 403 when it runs into a policy\n    exception from its own policy (which is a subclass of Forbidden). This\n    changes the handler over to return a 403 when any Forbidden comes in.\n    \n    Also, the volume helper methods in the function API client had incorrect\n    URLs, so those were also fixed (/volumes --> /os-volumes)\n    \n    Change-Id: If9dd002454338d07fcea0c2092c12f3961c3dcdf\n    Partial-Bug: #1554631\n    Closes-Bug: #1555826\n",

The OverQuota is different in volumes vs. snapshots, so they\n    need to be separated out into the different wrappers. But also, because\n    in snapshot creations, we need to catch a NotFound as a VolumeNotFound\n    and an OverLimit as an OverQuota for snapshots, we need to make a new\n    wrapper that mixes those two together for when we create snapshots.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia03f15232df71ca9a31ffbcca60f33949312a686\n    Partial-Bug: #1554631\n",
