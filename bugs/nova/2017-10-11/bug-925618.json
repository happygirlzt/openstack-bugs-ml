I don't believe the melange stuff has had anything but fairly basic manual testing up until the work your team has started doing.  \n\nWith Quantum, we're taking the first baby step in this direction using excercise.sh within devstack.  We will be extending these tests to verify tear-down as well.  Now that melange is in devstack (hooray!), it should be pretty easy to have a similar exercise file for melange.   My real goal is to get such tests into tempest so that checks are all in python and directly against the API, but the exercise.sh stuff is a big improvement over our status quo :) ",
