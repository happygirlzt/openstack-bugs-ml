    "description": "Two of the decorators in compute/manager.py do not return the values from the functions they wrap. This means that calls to those manager methods do not correctly return a value.\n\nThis is needed to use these methods in call. Currently none of the wrapped methods do this, but I need to add one. Also, it is non-obvious for a decorator to eat a return value.",
