So is it necessary to specify the subnet during VM creation? \n\nThe issue is that more than one subnet can be associated with an net-uuid - in which case it becomes impossible to select which of the possible subnets a VM should be created in.\n\nI don't think replacing net-id with subner-id is the right approach as having multiple subnets on the same network is an unusual configuration, and most of the time the user only needs/wants to specify the net-id.\n\nI'd like to see subnet-id as an optional, additional qualifier (think of it as an optional alternative to  v4-fixed-ip)\n",
