It happens\n    because parameter project_only=True in sqlalchemy query was missed.\n    Also this method must check instance existance in ANY tenant\n    if method was called with admin context.\n    \n    Due to new behaviour method was renamed to\n    _check_instance_exists_in_project\n    \n    Tests for _check_instance_exists_in_project were added.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1475663\n    \n    Change-Id: Iad99a41823bb538a880b7cc67afc92cc97f09377\n",
