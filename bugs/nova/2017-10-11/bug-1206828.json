This change follows on from that simplification.\n    \n    As before, if I user wants to use PV mode, or HVM mode, then can set\n    vm_mode=xen or vm_mode=hvm, respectively. This will override any other\n    way of selecting the mode.\n    \n    For consistency, we now check the os_type to be either windows or linux,\n    which, without vm_mode, chooses HVM or XEN mode respectively.\n    \n    For backwards compatibility, all VHD and DISK type images default to\n    vm_mode=xen.\n    \n    In all other cases, we default to HVM, as this is the safest option\n    that works with most images.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1206828\n    DocImpact\n    Change-Id: Iab2ffdc7ad396b853c7aed20d46bf12320b76c21\n",
