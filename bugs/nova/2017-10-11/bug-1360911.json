This\n    eventually calls context.to_dict() in nova/rpc.py, which breaks\n    for a NoneType object. So we should pick the current context\n    from oslo_context or switch to the admin context.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Pranesh Pandurangan <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: 1360911\n    Change-Id: Ic37e184a56377739cd7cda5ba4bde236990fef9e\n",
