This\n    does not provide a full set of installations instructions. This is\n    somewhat intentional:\n    \n    * there are many ways to deploy a wsgi application and we'd like the\n      packagers and deployers to choose a way that works best for them,\n      not impose one, and there's no way for us to document them all. It\n      is better to point to resources that explain some of the options\n      and allow people to inform themselves so they can make informed\n      choices\n    * we're no longer that keen on the mod_wsgi, but it tends to be the\n      easiest to document (fewer moving parts)\n    * the uwsgi+systemd method in devstack, while great, is abstracted\n      enough that the moving parts are not entirely visible and is one\n      of several ways for that scenario\n    \n    Change-Id: Ief07c313e012df63558de632047258e8e11736c1\n    Related-Bug: #1692375\n",
