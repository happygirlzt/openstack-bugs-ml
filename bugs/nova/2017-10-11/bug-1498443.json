Froloff <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Sep 22 14:39:40 2015 +0300\n\n    Fix more inconsistency between Nova-Net and Neutron\n    \n    The commit c62f698ef1f1e69bd5eb3c6544ee305f96488d42 fixed one\n    incosistency between Nova-Net and Neutron, when Neutron returns 404\n    error for list_floatingip and Nova translates it into 500 computeFault.\n    However, there are two other places where list_floatingips is called.\n    \n    Move common code into private helper function, where 404 Error from\n    Neutron is gracefully handled, and use it where appropriate.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1498443\n    Related-Bug: #1163670\n    \n    Change-Id: I9229d882712df1ad57afbda7477fa4d72f4fd83c\n",
