    "description": "Previously (bug 1013689) there is a little shell script at the end of guestfs.py that attempts to wait 10 seconds for the guestfs process to 'die'. When that does not occur a process execution error gets raised which raises a useless error message. We are still seeing that issue with the following:\n\n$ guestmount --version\nguestmount 1.16.19rhel=6,release=1.el6\n \nIt might be nice to make that 10s configurable in the future + better logging??",

We are still seeing that issue with the following:\n\n$ guestmount --version\nguestmount 1.16.19rhel=6,release=1.el6\n\nSo instead of running a little shell script how about we check for the process in /proc, use python to test if its alive, use the logging system to know what is happening here so that it can be easier to identify what is the root cause of this issue (and how often it occurs) instead of silently ignoring it (no logging..., un-obvious exceptions/messaging...)",
