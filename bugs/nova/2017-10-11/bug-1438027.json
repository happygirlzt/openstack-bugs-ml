Per the libvirt folks, this is not by design,\nbut a side effect of how/when the snap chain was created. For the Cinder-Nova\nonline snapshot case, it's broken for sure.\n\npost-1.2.7 (eg: v.1.2.9) behaviour:\n    Although the pre-1.2.7 behaviour is seen in this case too, per the\nlibvirt folks, _RELATIVE flag _must_ be used to guarantee qemu maintains\nrelative backing paths.\n\nWithout this patch:\n    _RELATIVE flag was used only for blockCommit of a network disk and\nraises excp if this flag isn't present. For file-backed disks case, Cinder\nis broken as qemu can't maintain relative paths.\n\n    For blockRebase this flag is never used, probably because blockRebase\nmaintained relative path (see above) even before this flag came into existence.\n\nWith this patch:\n    _RELATIVE flag if available, is used for both blockCommit & blockRebase\ncases for both file and network backed disks.\n\n    If unavailable, it means we are dealing with pre-1.2.7 libvirt, and\nit raises excp for blockCommit case (since we can't get relative paths and\nCinder flow is broken), but only puts out a warning message for blockRebase\ncase (since relative paths works even for older libvirt)\n\nSummary:\n    1) Uses _RELATIVE for blockRebase if available, for both file and network\n       disks. Don't raise excp if flag isn't present, thus preserving older\n       behaviour.\n\n    2) Uses _RELATIVE for blockCommit if available, for both file and network\n       disks. Raise excp if flag isn't present to ensure Cinder flow isn't\n       broken (old behaviour changes here, for file backed disks only)\n",
