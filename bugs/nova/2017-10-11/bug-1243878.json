Both of them were returning only the response\n    data which is obtained from the nova-metadata-service. Since they were returning\n    only the response data, the Content-Type returned to the clients has the default\n    one which is - \"text/html\". Ideally this should be set to the data type which is\n    present in the HTTP Response. The fix now includes the Content-Type which is\n    returned by nova-metadata-service\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1243878\n    Change-Id: If68f0b508fbea4ecd1eb0e58d602b5ba6ccbe263\n",
