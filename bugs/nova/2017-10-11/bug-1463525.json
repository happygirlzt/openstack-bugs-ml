That call is\n    based on the 'encrypted' key in connection_info['data'] returned from\n    the os-initialize_connection Cinder API.\n    \n    However, just because the volume has an encryption key in Cinder does\n    not mean that the corresponding volume driver in Nova supports\n    encrypting the volume, like in the case of RBD volumes.\n    \n    Tempest has tests for encrypted volumes which succeed today in the Ceph\n    job but they are actually false positives since without Cinder change\n    I03f8cae05cc117e14f7482115de685fc9f3fa54a, the 'encrypted' key is not\n    set in the connection_info dict and Nova doesn't attempt encryption of\n    the volume during attach.\n    \n    The Ceph job fails when encrypted=True is in connection_info because\n    cryptsetup (and luks which extends cryptsetup) requires the\n    'device_path' key in the connection_info dict, which is set when\n    connecting the volume during attach via the corresponding Nova volume\n    driver. In the case of RBD and libvirt, the LibvirtNetVolumeDriver is\n    used and the 'device_path' key isn't set, so a KeyError is raised when\n    trying to construct the CryptsetupEncryptor or LuksEncryptor objects.\n    \n    This change adds a check in CryptsetupEncryptor such that if the\n    device_path is not in connection_info, a VolumeEcnryptionNotSupported\n    error is raised rather than KeyError.\n    \n    Note that this doesn't fix the encrypted volume tests in Tempest. Those\n    tests fail due to a timeout waiting for the volume status to be 'in-use'\n    which doesn't happen since the compute manager rolls back the\n    reservation on the volume when the error occurs. The Tempest tests will\n    have to be skipped in the Ceph job until volume encryption is supported\n    for RBD in Nova, which will be a separate set of changes.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1463525\n    \n    Change-Id: I8efc2628b09d4e9e59831353daa080b20e17ccde\n",
