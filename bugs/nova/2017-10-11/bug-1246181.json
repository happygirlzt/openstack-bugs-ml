If we soft reboot an instance, and then delete it, the instance may not be deleted and stand on deleting task state, this is because the bug below,\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1111213\nand I have fixed this bug yet several months ago(just for libvirt driver).\n2. The other issue is, if the instance is rebooted just before deleting the files under instance dir, then it may become to a running deleted one, and this bug is at below:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1246181\nI want to fix it now, and I need your advice.\nThe commit is here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54477/ , you can post your advice on gerrit or mail to me.\n \nThe ways to fix bug #2 may be these(just for libvirt driver in my mind):\n1. Add a lock to reboot operation like the deleting operation, so the reboot operation and the delete operation will be done in sequence. \nBut on the other hand, the soft reboot operation may cost 120s if the instance doesn't support graceful shutdown, I think it is too long for a user to delete an instance, so this may not be the best way.\n2. Check the instance state at the last of _cleanup method in libvirt driver, and if it is still running, destroy it again.\nThis way is usable but both Nikola Dipanov and I don't like this 'ugly' way.\n3. Check the instance vm state and task state in nova db before booting in reboot, if it is deleted/deleting, stop the reboot process, this will access db at driver level, it is a 'ugly' way, too.\n \nNikola suggests that 'maybe we can leverage task/vm states and refactor how reboot is done so we can back out of a reboot on a delete', but I think we should let user delete an instance at any time and any state, so the delete operation during 'soft reboot' may not be forbidden.\n \nThanks and waiting for your voice!\n",
