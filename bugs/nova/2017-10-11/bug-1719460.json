    "description": "Microversion 2.16 adds the ability to show the host status of an instance when listing servers with details or showing a single server's details. By default that is only shown for an admin.\n\nChange https://review.openstack.org/#/c/355558/ helped improve the performance for this by avoiding lazy-loading the instance.services column by doing the join in the DB API when querying the instances from the database.\n\nHowever, that check is not based on version 2.16, like the 2.26 tags check below it.\n\nThis means that we are unnecessarily joining with the services table when querying instances with microversions < 2.16, which happens, for example, by default in the openstack CLI which uses microversion 2.1.\n\nWe arguably should make this also conditional on policy so we don't join for non-admins by default, but that's less of an issue probably as non-admins probably aren't listing thousands of instances from the deployment like an admin would.",
