I'm also not certain I have the capacity right now to address it, due to work responsibilities.\n\nThat said, the bug report reads as a \"this is out of spec\" report, which leads me to ask the question, \"What spec is the OP expecting compliance with?\"  Additionally, the assertion that the \"Retry-After\" header should be \"Retry-At\" is incorrect, per RFC 2616 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).  Also, per RFC 2616, the value of the \"Retry-After\" header, if provided, may be either a delta seconds (as we use) or an \"HTTP-date\".  It is possible that the spec the OP is referring to specifies use of a \"Retry-At\" header, in which case we can add that at little cost, but we should not drop the \"Retry-After\" header, and we should be aware that \"Retry-At\" is not a standard HTTP header.",

I suspect we're using the delta because the time specification needs to conform to the HTTP spec.  If we look at what RFC 2616 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616) says about Retry-After, we see:\n\n  [...] The value of this field can be either an HTTP-date or an integer number\n  of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the response.\n\n      Retry-After  = \"Retry-After\" \":\" ( HTTP-date | delta-seconds )\n\n  Two examples of its use are\n\n      Retry-After: Fri, 31 Dec 1999 23:59:59 GMT\n      Retry-After: 120\n\nA search for the HTTP-date turns up section 3.3.1:\n\n  All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time\n  (GMT), without exception.
