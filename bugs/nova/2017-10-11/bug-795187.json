Notice this line:\n\n\"\n kernel:[50922.735291] general protection fault: 0000 [#1] SMP\n\"\n\nDue to the crash caught in the kernel, it has left some processes in a infinite disk wait state and thus they can't be killed.  Since the kernel is hosed, all you can do is reboot.\n\nWhat version of XenServer is this?  What kernel?",
