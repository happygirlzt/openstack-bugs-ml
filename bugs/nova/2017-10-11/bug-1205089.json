Soft reboot is not\n    supported as it requires additional configuration on the LPAR when it's\n    spawned so this patch simply performs an immediate hard reboot.\n    \n    Also adds tests for start_lpar and stop_lpar which didn't exist before.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1205089\n    \n    Change-Id: Iad64dda79f46d18c7aa5bee12ed41e7a01853d34\n",
