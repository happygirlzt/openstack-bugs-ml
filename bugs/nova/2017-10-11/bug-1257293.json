It seems that incorrect behaviour seen in https://bugs.launchpad.net/oslo/+bug/1178375/comments/26 is still present in the latest oslo.messaging.\n\nHere is what I did to verify the fix:\n\n\n1. Installed Fedora 20 with latest updates.\n2. installed  qpid-cpp-server, started service.\n3. get oslo.messaging: https://github.com/openstack/oslo.messaging.git\n4. installed oslo.messaging and requirements with pip, installed qpid-python.\n5. get oslo server and client for testing: https://github.com/kgiusti/oslo-messaging-clients.git\n6. ran two testing servers with topology=1, sent rpc request to them -> got single server action triggered (correct).\n7. ran two testing servers with topology=2, sent rpc request to them -> got both server actions triggered (wrong).\n\nIn case of topology=1, it looks as follows:\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-server.py --topology=1 server01 &\n[1] 2634\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# Running server, name=server01 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 1\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-server.py --topology=1 server02 &\n[2] 2656\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# Running server, name=server02 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 1\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nCalling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None\nMethod=methodB, args={'arg1': 'arg2'}\nUsing QPID topology version 1\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:04 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nReturn value={u'application': u'my-client', u'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:04 2013', u'cast': None}\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nCalling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None\nMethod=methodB, args={'arg1': 'arg2'}\nUsing QPID topology version 1\nserver02::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:07 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nReturn value={u'application': u'my-client', u'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:07 2013', u'cast': None}\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# \n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nCalling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None\nMethod=methodB, args={'arg1': 'arg2'}\nUsing QPID topology version 1\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:09 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nReturn value={u'application': u'my-client', u'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:09 2013', u'cast': None}\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# \n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nCalling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None\nMethod=methodB, args={'arg1': 'arg2'}\nUsing QPID topology version 1\nserver02::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:11 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nReturn value={u'application': u'my-client', u'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:11 2013', u'cast': None}\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]#\n\nIn case of topology=2, we see duplicate handlers triggered:\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-server.py --topology=2 server02 &\n[1] 2686\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# Running server, name=server02 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 2\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-server.py --topology=2 server01 &\n[2] 2692\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# Running server, name=server01 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 2\n\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# ./my-client.py --topology=2 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nCalling server on topic my-topic, server=None exchange=my-exchange namespace=my-namespace fanout=None\nMethod=methodB, args={'arg1': 'arg2'}\nUsing QPID topology version 2\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:54 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nserver02::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:54 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nReturn value={u'application': u'my-client', u'time': u'Mon Dec 23 14:10:54 2013', u'cast': None}\n[root@localhost oslo-messaging-clients]# \n\nThat said, is there a chance that the fix left the original bug intact?
