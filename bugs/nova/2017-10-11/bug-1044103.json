We might need to know the other information associated with the floating_ip after it associated with the instance. For example, instance_id, instance_name and auto_assigned. Otherwise, the client needs to get those information by calling another DB get() to obtain them from the DB after receiving the notification. It will save another call if the payload has those information.",
