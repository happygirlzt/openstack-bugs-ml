The use case was when\n    creating LOG at a module level when we have not yet called\n    logging.setup, we needed a way to delay creating actual loggers\n    \n    Added a handlers property in ContextAdapter so the existing testcase\n    can be used for lazy loggers as well\n    \n    Change-Id: Iae2e379f8a0d2d38836645e7648294dee97deaaa\n",
