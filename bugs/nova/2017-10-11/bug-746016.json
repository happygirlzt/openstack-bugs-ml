For example, uri and regex need to be pulled up into the rate element.\n\nI personally think we should not tinker with the OSAPI v1.1 when there's no overwhelming reason to, as appears to be the case here.  It shows a profound disrespect for our users, who must then update their code.\n\nKudos to Brian Lamar for finding this one.",
