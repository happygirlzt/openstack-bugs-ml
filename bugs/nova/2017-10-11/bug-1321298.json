Previously, if you set\n    resize_confirm_window to some small value, your resize instance could go\n    into error state because the periodic task was run after the migration\n    was updated but before the instance object was updated. This change makes it\n    so the instance is always updated before the migration.\n    \n    The _test_finish_resize test case has also been refactored to enforce\n    saving the instance object before the migration object. In the event\n    that the instance object is saved after the migration, like the previous\n    implementation, the test cases will fail since the states of the\n    migrations will be out of sync in the _mig_save assertions.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1321298\n    Change-Id: I0490fc4b4e03b36eb01a06a95ea761f4cf8df469\n",
