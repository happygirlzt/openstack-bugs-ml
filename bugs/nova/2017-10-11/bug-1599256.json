This can result in both a join and a separate query against the potential \"manual_join\" tables.\n\nThis appears to have been introduced with the behavior in this commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/2e68b2298e94a15d1282c0fb46804b9efa6c8b3a\n\nWhere the list of expected_attr here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L55\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L110\n\nis further extended with the expected_attr list in the compute_api here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L2092\n\nResulting in a columns_to_join list resembling:\n\n['flavor', 'info_cache', 'metadata', 'metadata', 'system_metadata', 'info_cache', 'security_groups']\n\nIn nova.db.sqlalchemy.api:_manual_join_columns(), only the first 'metadata' entry gets removed resulting in both a sqlalchemy joinedload() hint (joining against instance_metadata) and separately querying instance_metadata via _instances_fill_metadata().  The 'metadata' join in particular can be rather inefficient.  In some cases  this results in about 10x the data being pulled from the database compared to just the \"manual join\" - this problem is particularly amplified for projects with a large number of associated instances.",

            "content": "Hmm, does look like _get_instances_by_filters adds too many joins.\n\nWe could just filter out duplicates in the object layer, but maybe best to just check for duplicates and raise an exception, and fix up what we find.\n\nI think we should look why its adding those extra joins only when you add some joins. Its a bit odd, probably need to look at why the callers are doing all that. Its very possible the object layer adds everything that is needed extra now anyways.",
