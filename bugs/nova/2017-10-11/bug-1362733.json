(since it does not take into account the present task_state of instance)\n\ni.e in, \nnova/nova/api/openstack/common.py \n\n   vm_states.ERROR: {\n        'default': 'ERROR',\n    },\nAs you can see above the task_state of instance is not taken into account if vm_state is in ERROR.\n\n\nFIX:\nneed to change it to:\n   vm_states.ERROR: {\n        'default': 'ERROR',\n        task_states.REBUILDING: 'REBUILD',\n        task_states.REBUILD_BLOCK_DEVICE_MAPPING: 'REBUILD',\n        task_states.REBUILD_SPAWNING: 'REBUILD',\n    },\n\nwill wait for nova guys to let me know if they are ok with this change.",

When a rebuild\n    is issued on this instance, the status does not display as REBUILD.\n    \n    Similarly, when a rebuild is issued on an instance and the operation\n    fails, the instance turns to ERROR state. Now if we issue a rebuild\n    again, the status does not display as REBUILD.\n    \n    This patch fixes the above mentioned issues by displaying the correct\n    status i.e REBUILD.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id11c9d31683a049c61fd751dc0ddabaf22c96cb9\n    Closes-Bug: #1362733\n",
