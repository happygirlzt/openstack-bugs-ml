The log message is intended to show a path that does not represent a path, but in the case the path does not actually exist, it gives the following uninformative message:\n\n2013-10-14 06:25:21.404 45722 DEBUG nova.virt.libvirt.driver [-] skipping None since it looks like volume get_instance_disk_info /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py:4299\n\nWhen the path is not defined it should log the instance it is looking at instead.",

The first will log None if the path does not exist,\n    so reverse the order of the checks.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1239747\n    Change-Id: Ieb52ba0584ad789dc55f40e0172cf5ed41e86fbe\n",
