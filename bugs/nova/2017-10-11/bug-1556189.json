    "description": "In some cases, destroying an instance can fail, having the instance log files still in-use.\n\nThis can happen in the following scenario:\n1. The vm is powered on\n2. The vm is requested to be destroyed shortly after (less than a few seconds). This driver will now attempt to stop the serial console workers, but none exist yet\n3. The instance power on event callback is run, spawning the serial console workers\n4. The instance is powered off as the destroy operation continues. The serial console workers are not explicitly stopped now. The instance serial port named pipe should be stopped now, which will cause the serial workers to stop themselves shortly after, but before this happens, the driver attempts to delete the instance files, while the console logs are still in use, which will fail.\n\nTrace: http://paste.openstack.org/show/490196/\n\nThe easiest way to avoid this issue would be to simply retry deleting the instance files if this fails, also ensuring again that the console workers are stopped. Note that this is quite unlikely to happen in a real life deployment.",
