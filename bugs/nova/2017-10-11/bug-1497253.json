However, if that same AZ does not exist in Cinder,\n    the volume create request will fail - which is bug 1496235.\n    \n    Cinder works around this with b85d2812a8256ff82934d150dbc4909e041d8b31\n    using a config option to allow falling back to a default Cinder AZ if\n    the one requested does not exist.  By default this fallback is disabled\n    though.\n    \n    It also sounds like availability zones in Cinder were an artifact from\n    when Cinder was split out from the nova-volume service, but Cinder AZ\n    use cases are also unclear.  And it's also unclear what the relationship\n    is between AZs in Nova and Cinder.\n    \n    So given the problems here and the lack of a clear use case to justify\n    having this configuration option in tree, along with it's added\n    complexity, deprecate the option for removal.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1496235\n    Related-Bug: #1380780\n    Related-Bug: #1489575\n    Related-Bug: #1497253\n    \n    Change-Id: I52cd3d8867d3b35f5caba377302bfc52c112f1d6\n",

            "content": "I should have been more clear in the bug report, so here's another attempt:\n\n1. User has cinder AZ's and nova AZ of the same names\n\n2. AZ's physical location is different, and user wants instances to have same AZ as their volumes\n\n3. This is generally achieved by setting  cross_az_attach option to False, because since \nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/157041/ volumes are created in the same AZ as instances.\n\n4. However, what if user doesn't explicitly provide AZ when creating the instance (so the scheduler can distribute the load evenly and according to available resources)? \nThis is the situation possibly requiring a fix. In such case, nova uses the None value for availability zone at the time it calls  volume_api.create. Cinder creates the volume in some AZ it has available, and when nova finishes creating the instance it creates it in some of its available AZ. There's no relation between these two, so if they end up being different, we'll hit the error \" Instance %(instance)s and volume %(vol)s are not in the same availability_zone....\"\n\nSo, my proposal (as expressed in https://review.openstack.org/225119) is that:\n\n- if cross_az_attach is set to false, nova should ensure cinder and nova AZ's are matching, AND it should make sure this rule is true also in the case when AZ was not specified by user. Thus I propose to look for instance's real AZ BEFORE actually trying to create the volume, and use this value also for volume.",
