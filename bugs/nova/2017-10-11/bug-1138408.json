    "description": "In nova using libvirt, there is a method to create tap interface under linux_net.py but there is not one for removing them.\nUsually, nova plougins use either the delete_ovs_vif_port that invokes OVS-specific commands and will not work in an environment OVS-free, and the second available option is under QuantumLinuxBridgeInterfaceDriver::unplug but this one is attached to linux bridge. So, there is not native call for removing a tap interface based on the dev name.",
