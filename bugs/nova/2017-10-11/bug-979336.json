Currently it looks like the EC2 terminate operation can partially succeed, then throw an exception (thus signifying failure when actually some instances were terminated).\n\nSee: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/ec2/cloud.py#L1318\n\nYou will notice that the instance ids are validated inside the loop, instead of beforehand, thus if instance ids 1, 2, 3 are passed in, 3 could be invalid, but 1 and 2 would have been terminated already, but an exception would be thrown for #3, thus sending a error back to the user, when really 2 instances were terminated.\n\nThat seems bad. Possible verify before u terminate and report partial success....",
