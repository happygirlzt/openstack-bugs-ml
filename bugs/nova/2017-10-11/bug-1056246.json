    "description": "In order to avoid problems with tgtd not knowing that it should pick up iscsi target configs from /etc/cinder/volumes (formerly /var/lib/nova/volumes or /var/lib/cinder/volumes), the following commit added the --conf option to the tgt-adm command:\n\n   https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/0a09bf5f\n\nHowever this just creates a false sense of security, as problems arise if a volume is created before a tgtd restart and then we attempt to attach afterwards (on F17, this manifests as an iscsiadm login timeout).\n\nIt would be preferable to fail fast when the tgtd config is not correct from the get-go.\n\nThis would force users to correct their /etc/tgt/targets.conf:\n\n  sudo sed -i '1iinclude /etc/cinder/volumes/*' /etc/tgt/targets.conf\n\ninstead of volumes appearing to work and then inexplicably failing after a tgtd restart.\n\nThis fail-fast behavior would be achieved by reverting the commit mentioned above.",
