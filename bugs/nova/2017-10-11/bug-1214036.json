    "description": "nova/network/linux_net.py and nova/virt/libvirt/vif.py call various brctl and 'ip addr' commands to create and destroy network bridges, IP addresses, network devices, and network routes.   These are significant changes that can render the node completely unusable if they're wrong, and it would be nice to indicate that we're doing so to give admins a starting point for debugging.  Currently we log these operations at DEBUG level, which means they are not logged unless someone changes the default_notification_level in nova.conf.  We should log them at INFO instead.\n\nNone of these operations should be called frequently enough to create excessive log output.\n\nDownstream bug report https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=903504",
