Since v2.1 i meant to be identical to v2 it should not\n    appear in v2 either.\n    \n    This change disables the pci api functionality in v2.1. It will be renabled\n    soon after microversions is enabled using a microversion bump.\n    \n    Related-Bug: 1426241\n    Partially implements blueprint v2-on-v3-api\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifc1d6f24d5a637270154b996087a98b41133e014\n",

The original intent was to enable\n    it in a microversion but that never happened.\n    \n    We should just delete this API since it has a number of issues\n    anyway:\n    \n    1. It's not documented (which makes sense since it's not enabled).\n    2. The PciHypervisorController just takes the compute_nodes.pci_stats\n       dict and dumps it to json out of the REST API with no control over\n       the keys in the response. That means if we ever change the fields\n       in the PciDevicePool object, we implicitly introduce a backward\n       incompatible change in the REST API.\n    3. We don't want to be reporting host stats out of the API [1].\n    4. To make the os-hypervisors extension work in a multi-cell environment\n       we'd have to add uuids to the PciDevices model and change the API to\n       return and take in uuids to identify the devices for GET requests.\n    5. And last but not least, no one has asked for this in over two years.\n    \n    As a result of removing this API we can also remove the join on the\n    pci_devices table when showing details about an instance or listing\n    instances, which were added years ago because of the PciServerController:\n    \n    Id3c8a0b187e399ce2acecd4aaa37ac95e731d46c\n    \n    Id3e60c3c56c2eb4209e8aca8a2c26881ca86b435\n    \n    [1] https://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/policies.html?#metrics-gathering\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1426241\n    Closes-Bug: #1673869\n    \n    Change-Id: I9099744264eeec175672d10d04da69648dec1a9d\n",
