If you're not using shared storage, you're in a situation where you simply wish to delete them, forget the crashed node, and move on.\n\nIn this case, I think you would update the nova database to set those instances to deleted=1 so they no longer show in the nova list.\n\nI'm going to see if I can get more comment on this from other developers.",
