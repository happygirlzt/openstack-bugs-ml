    "description": "During initialization, the VMware Nova compute driver checks whether a VC extension with key 'org.openstack.compute' exists and if not, it registers one. This is a race condition. If multiple services try to register the same extension, only one of them will succeed. The fix is to catch InvalidArgument fault from vSphere API and ignore the exception.",
