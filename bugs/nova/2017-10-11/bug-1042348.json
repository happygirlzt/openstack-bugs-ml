I think that this is a bug and it would be interesting to know what the intended functionality should be.\n\nDan's Response: \n\nThis is something we were\nplanning on re-visiting after the initial nova/quantum v2 integration in F-2,\nbut we never did.  In Essex, which is that if no networks are\nspecified, the VM gets a NIC on each network it has access to (either\na private network owned by the tenant, or a 'public/shared' network).\n\nHere's one possible approach: the cloud operator can specify an\nordered list of network-ids as part of Nova config.  A VM with no\nnetworks specified via the API will get that ordered set of NICs.  If no such\nnetworks are specified in the config, we could either give VMs no NICs\n(probably not a great user experience) or default to giving a VM a NIC\non each shared network (would need a way to deterministically order\nthese shared networks for this to be reasonable).\n\nAnother option would be to keep the current behavior if no default  networks is specified in the nova config.",
