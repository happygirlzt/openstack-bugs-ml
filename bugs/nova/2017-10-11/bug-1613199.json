The cert-authority issue has been reported to paramiko - https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/issues/771\n\nI think this shows a gap in our current test coverage. We should add a test for the \"cert-authority\" case as described above. I am confirming this bug to add this test coverage.\n\n\n",

            "content": "Hi Guys,\nthanks for taking an interest in this bug (I was afraid it wouldn't get any interest since very few people use this very useful feature of OpenSSHd). Acouple of things I should point out:\n\n1) Augustina  identified the commit that broke things but missed a subsequent commit to the code:\n\nhttp://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/commit/?id=452fe92787ff871417846748fc13e2a6a2899325\n\nwhich moves the upstream dependency from paramiko to cryptography\n\n2) The issue of using a cert-authority in ssh_known_hosts to authenticate hosts to users is related (and indeed they should both be fixed by the upstream dependency) but I think the issue of using a cert-authority to authenticate users (via either ~/.ssh/authorized_keys of /etc/ssh/sshd_config TrustedUserCA option) is more important.\n\n3) Another related case of the use of SSH_FORCE_COMMAND in the authorized_keys file. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried this (indeed it probably makes more sense as cloud-init user data) but it might be useful to be able to set a pub key with a restricted shell in nova. For example this (take from /root/.ssh/authorized_keys)\n\nno-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,command=\"echo 'Please login as the user \\\"debian\\\" rather than the user \\\"root\\\".';echo;sleep 10\" ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDgG1+9o2Bryv/1hPfRzzrZp7GmBx4NenAxNoG5koZGV/+1Y/UyeYKp8Ho7DKp2xHQbvJTLd2PcEo+mRgknnaSX/sLoxN099hMHM2T6K9shkGRLP8m+RGSTa5kWjwaDJ5rWwtH06Oj7e84sJh1Wv2IAPCmpK0PqkNcv2GFsALhVgcIW27zBb7o2Yg5yUahnpuwBcojocG172wGSsYQw7sAXPbS+W2ohtBwPeI9aL0ET3W5isKR6zcTuLmulvgMvD9qVKJGaAQMfZrlIKyDpHNUcWCOi9xk4oLBT3nAwMfzvSxMU73nNEX29L0M1eTB6ab4Lnn54rlHPOsO538TsPjt5 hines@tun\n\nis acceptable to ssh-keygen -qlf but would fail with either paramiko or cyptography\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything I can help with or who I should submit merge requests to.

            "content": "First off, apologies, when I first glanced at your bug I initially thought you were reporting an issue with Nova not accepting valid public key files. Upon further investigation, I attempted to follow your reproduction steps by adding a public key generated by a certificate authority and did not experience the error. When I looked at that public key file, it did not have the prefix \"cert-authority\". Upon further investigation, it looks like these libraries are working as expected for the key files formatted per RFC 4253: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4253#section-6.6.\n\nSo the big question I have for you is what exactly is your workflow for generating the public key that you are trying to add to nova?",

            "content": "Thanks Augistina,\nI believe you are correct, nova does accept keys generated according to rfc4253. At issue is whether nova should accept only keys formated according to rfc4253, or all contents intended for the default users authorized_keys file. (The format of the authorized_keys file isn't covered by the RFC, but by the man page for OpenSSHD https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?sshd(8) under the section AUTHORIZED KEYS FILE FORMAT.)\n\nMy point is that keys generated according to RFC4253 are a subset of the content people expect to put in the authorized_keys. Now nova already goes beyond RFC4253 by accept a comment field on the ened of the public key matter (or more specifically both paramiko and python-cryptography go beyond RFC4253).\nIts tempting to say that nova shouldn't go beyond RFC4253 because it already support public keys, but I think this is a loss of functionality.\n\nSo my workflow was roughtly:\n\nssh-keygen -f ca\nssh-keygen -f personal\necho \"cert-authority \" > uploadthis.pub\ncat ca.pub >> uploadthis.pub\nnova keypair-add -f uploadthis.pub ca_keypair\nssh-keygen -s ca -I Chris_Key -n debian,ubuntu,ec2-user -V +520w personal.pub # this produces personal-cert.pub\neval `ssh-agent`   # note that gnome-ssh-keyring doesn't work, Mac OS keyring does, OpenSSH ssh-agent does\nssh-add personal\nnova boot .....\nssh ...\n\nI then collect pub keys from my colleagues and repeat the ssh-keygen -s and lock up the file \"ca\" (the private part) in a safe. My colleagues don't need access to the private part of ca because they have their own cert (in the same way my web server doesn't need access to the private part of the x509 root cas for SSL verification). When ever we on board a new team member, the ca file comes out of the safe. Whenever a team member leaves, we update the certificate revocation list (Actually we haven't had to do this yet, since this is a new workflow). Because everyone had their own personal key we don't need to rekey the instances.\n\nOther workflows that are impacted involve pre-pending differemt material to the front of the public key. For example if you wish to use nova to setup an rsync server that no one can log into, and restrict rsync to a subdirectory you could follow instructions here\n\nhttps://www.samba.org/ftp/unpacked/rsync/support/rrsync\n\nThe full list of options is in the sshd man page\n\nThanks for your time looking at this (and reading my long comments :-)\n\nCheers,\n--\nChris.",
