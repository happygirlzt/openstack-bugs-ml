This updates the\n      param2id method to call the appropriate conversion, and doesn't\n      attempt to cast the value to an int.\n    \n      There is an additional issue with the nova-manage commands with the\n      introduction of Cinder.  The calls in nova-manage are direct to the\n      nova database which when using Cinder is not valid.  Add an error message\n      when trying to use delete or re-attach commands as they don't work.\n    \n      This change deprecates the nova-manage delete function as it's now\n      implemented as an admin extension (nova commit id: If795599d and\n      cinder commit id: I29f4b892).\n    \n      The reattach command is only valid for nova-volumes, a similar extension\n      will need to be added to cover cinder at which time the nova-manage volume\n      reattach can be deprecated as well.\n    \n      Partial fix for bug #1051603\n    \n    Change-Id: I666d4e627dee4a2025f7135560ee36c40f4bf17a\n",
