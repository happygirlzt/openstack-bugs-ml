Stopped QPID. nov-network had an exception (below [1] - this is a separate issue and I would guess that one woud want to catch the exception and retry to connect)\n3.  When QPID restarts nova-network manages to reconnect again (with an exception and then terminates).\n\nThe example that I had with the nova-network was with packages and not devstack. Any idea why this may be different behaviour?\n\nI will take a look at devstack with Quantum service and post my findings.\n\nThanks\nGary\n\n[1] Trace of crach for nova-network when qpid terminates\n\n2012-11-03 18:54:41 INFO nova.openstack.common.rpc.impl_qpid [-] Connected to AMQP server on localhost:5672\n2012-11-03 18:54:41 DEBUG nova.service [-] Creating Consumer connection for Service network from (pid=7002) start /opt/stack/nova/nova/service.py:404\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/hubs/poll.py\", line 97, in wait\n    readers.get(fileno, noop).cb(fileno)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/green/select.py\", line 48, in on_read\n    current.switch(([original], [], []))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/eventlet/greenthread.py\", line 192, in main\n    result = function(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/service.py\", line 123, in run_server\n    server.start()\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/service.py\", line 412, in start\n    self.conn.create_consumer(node_topic, rpc_dispatcher, fanout=False)\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/openstack/common/rpc/amqp.py\", line 136, in create_consumer\n    self.connection.create_consumer(topic, proxy, fanout)\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py\", line 526, in create_consumer\n    consumer = TopicConsumer(self.conf, self.session, topic, proxy_cb)\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py\", line 187, in __init__\n    {}, name or topic, {})\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py\", line 130, in __init__\n    self.reconnect(session)\n  File \"/opt/stack/nova/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py\", line 135, in reconnect\n    self.receiver = session.receiver(self.address)\n  File \"<string>\", line 6, in receiver\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/qpid/messaging/endpoints.py\", line 619, in receiver\n    raise e\nMalformedAddress: unrecognized characters line:1,18: openstack/network.(none) ;
