    "description": "'context' is not passed to InstanceList.fill_faults() method. \n\nPreviously in sqlalchemy.api level 'instance_fault_get_by_instance_uuids' method doesn't properly used 'context' because 'model_query' inside doesn't really use context attributes. After switching to enginefacade this problem was found because we always need real 'context' to store 'session' in it. \n\nThe 'context' can be None e.g. when we create new empty InstanceList object by 'instance_list = objects.InstanceList()' and then call 'instance_list.fill_faults()'  (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py#L404-L407)",
