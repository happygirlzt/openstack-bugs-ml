However, after speaking with some of the VMware\nteam, the driver could be simplified a good bit if we just drop ESX\nsupport since there is no intention to support it in its current form.\n\nInstead of just pulling it now (based on the hypervisor deprecation\nplan that required CI), we'll mark it deprecated for Icehouse and pull\nit out for Juno.\n\nDocImpact\n\nChange-Id: I6553e8b39610cae78e5561e8d03a919476f0d99f",
