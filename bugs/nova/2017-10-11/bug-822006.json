I had to attempt multiple deletes over a 5-10 minute time period before I was finally able to delete the instance.  I'm guessing it was still attempting to make the build calls to make it active.  \n\nThis could also cause problems with the IP address being handed out again since it's assigned within the instance but not to the instance record.\n\nI'm running revision 1388 for reference.",

At least it was similar in the sense that the delete would get rid of the IPs, etc. But, the server still showed in the server list in \"SHUTDOWN\" status. I haven't been able to consistently reproduce it or diagnose what the exact cause is.",
