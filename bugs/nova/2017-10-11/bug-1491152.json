This is the intended method of disabling feature tests.\n    This first commit is to add code to lib/tempest to disable the shelve\n    feature test if the nova-cells service is enabled.  The next\n    st will remove the shelve blacklist from\n    http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/devstack/tempest-dsvm-cells-rc\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf1f9aaa63e5f17b7d8774b511940ba8421e0887\n    Partial-bug: 1491152\n",
