Sleeping 60 seconds\n- Each time nova retries the connection, it will create another connection to qpid and not close the previous connections.\n\n\nI think this exception case needs to be updated in https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/openstack/common/rpc/impl_qpid.py to close the connection:\n\n            except qpid_exceptions.ConnectionError, e:\n                msg_dict = dict(e=e, delay=delay)\n                msg = _(\"Unable to connect to AMQP server: %(e)s. \"\n                        \"Sleeping %(delay)s seconds\") % msg_dict\n                LOG.error(msg)\n                time.sleep(delay)\n                delay = min(2 * delay, 60)\n\nNote that quantum uses the same code for qpid.",
