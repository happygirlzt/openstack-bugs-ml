Instances can be launched from it perfectly, except that nova cannot mount it (I'm using loop and nbd as img_handlers) so as to inject files. From the logs it fails complaining that there are no available partitions. This is due to the fact that it \"kpartx -a\" doest not find any mapping from the disk image, although it will be possible to use the device directly (i.e. without any mappings).\n\nI do not really know if this is a bug or this is the expected behavior (namely, that images *must* contain partitions).",

            "content": "For file injection, if you have a whole disk image it tries to inject into partition 1.  If you have a separate kernel and ramdisk, it will try to inject without a partition. This means that you have to put your data in the first partition for a whole disk image.  If you don't care about injected files, you can safely ignore the warning.\n\nOn Feb 8, 2012, at 9:31 AM, Alvaro Lopez wrote:\n\n> Public bug reported:\n> \n> Hello there.\n> \n> I have a disk image with no partitions inside.
