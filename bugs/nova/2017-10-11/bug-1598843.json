This method creates a new Whitelist (based on the config\n    CONF.pci_passthrough_whitelist) and parses it every time it is called.  This\n    is not a huge overhead but this is obvioulsy not needed and a waste of cycles.\n    \n    Since only neutronv2 API uses get_pci_device_devspec(), this commit removes\n    the method in favor of using the Whitelist object directly (like it is done\n    in the PciDevTracker).\n    \n    Change-Id: Idee4e9edecff0672680f323a916201aee8eeeabd\n    Closes-Bug: #1598843\n",
