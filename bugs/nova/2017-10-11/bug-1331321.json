I'm going to move it to \"Opinion / Wishlist\", which is an easily-obtainable queue of older requests that have come on. \n\nIn case you want to work on that, consider writing a blueprints [1] and spec [2].

The effort to implement the requested feature is then driven only by the blueprint (and spec).\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
