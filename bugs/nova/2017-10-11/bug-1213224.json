(Since aggregates can have different metadata.)\n\n2) Since availability zones are used for exposing aggregates to the end user, I think it would actually make sense to allow one host to belong to different zones.  Imagine if I have a zone for \"has SSD local disks\", and a zone for \"has 10G networking\".  If a host has both, it should be possible for it to be part of both.  And the end-user should be able to select multiple zones for a given instance--the intersection of all specified zones would define the valid hosts for that instance.",

            "content": "As somebody trying to understand how to best leverage host aggregates, and availability zones, I stumbled upon this bug and that it is \"Confirmed\" raises a concern for me. I see the purpose of availability zone as being about \"availability\" more than being about \"hypervisor features\", and I would like to use it for this purpose. If this bug is addressed by preventing an availability zone from having multiple host aggregates, then I don't see the value of having an availability zone in the first place.\n\nThis document:\n\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/aggregates.html\n\nSeems to spell out the original intent. \"Availability Zones are the end-user visible logical abstraction for partitioning a cloud without knowing the physical infrastructure\" and \"one host can be in multiple aggregates, but it can only be in one availability zone\".\n\nChris' concerns that raised this issue seem to be:\n\n- User can select availability zone, but cannot select host aggregate. If they are using availability zone to select a host aggregate, and the availability zone matches multiple host aggregates, the decision is ambiguous. How does a user specify \"only SSD\" or \"only 10GbE\"?\n\nI think these requirements are met through host aggregates and flavor keys, are they not? The flavour would specify that it requires a solution that has the \"SSD\" feature or the \"10GbE\" feature, and this would match against the host aggregates to find the host aggregate that meets these requirements. The availability zone is then about choosing whether you want to choose from the equipment in availability zone A or availability zone B, with the expectation that a failure in one availability zone should have minimized impact on another availability zone.\n\nIf you agree with my conclusion here, I think this bug should be closed as \"Won't Fix\". Then, I can proceed with comfort to use availability zone in the way that I think it should be used...\n\nThanks!",

Rather, some host aggregates *are also* availability zones, but a given host can only be in one availability zone.\n\nI went and looked at the code, and the way it is currently written I think it is actually okay to have multiple host aggregates specifying the same availability zone.\n\nThe logic in the AvailabilityZoneFilter is basically to loop over all host aggregates for the host in question, and if one of them has an availability zone (there should be only one) then the filter will check it against the availability zone specified by the user.\n\nAs such, I'm going to close this bug.",
