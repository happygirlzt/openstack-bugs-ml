If you specify this hint, the instance created will get added to that group.  Policy set on that group will be enforced when the scheduler goes to schedule the instance, without any changes needed to scheduler config.",

The group would get stored in the instance's system_metadata.  Any other instances with that same group in their system metadata would be put into a list to be used by the filter for enforcing affinity.\n\nIn Icehouse:\n\nYou can enable both GroupAffinityFilter and GroupAntiAffinityFilter for the filter scheduler at the same time.  You must define an instance group named 'foo' with a policy of 'anti-affinity'.  Then, you can boot an instance with a scheduler hint of group=foo.  That instance will get added to the group and the anti-affinity filter will automatically get used since it's in a group with that policy set.\n\n\nThis is certainly a change in behavior.  The problem really is that we released incomplete group support without the API in Havana.  Technically you could have used it, and the changes we've made break you if you used it the way it was.",

            "content": "Proposed solution to be backwards compatible:\n\n1) if group=foo is specified and group 'foo' does not exist, automatically create it.  Set a special policy type of \"scheduler\" on the automatically created group.\n\n2) Rename the group scheduler filters that work on the 'affinity' and 'anti-affinity' policies of instance groups.\n\n3) Add new filters with the old names that apply affinity/anti-affinity for instances in groups with the policy of 'scheduler'.  They will get applied if you configure the scheduler to use them.\n\nThat should result in allow both the new style behavior if you enable the new filters, as well as retain backwards compatibility with the old code / behavior.",
