    "description": "When using an external gateway for fixed ips as mentioned in option 4 here:\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-compute/admin/content/existing-ha-networking-options.html\n\nIt is possible to setup the gateway to route traffic properly, but the traffic will be snatted by default by nova-network. In many configurations using an external gateway, this is not desired, so there should be a way to disable the snat rule and/or limit it.\n\nThere is also an issue with snatting multiple floating ips. Picture the following scenario:\n\nTwo floating ip pools 10.1.0.0/24 on vlan10 and 192/168.0.0/24 on vlan11\nvm has 10.1.0.2 and 192.168.0.2\nall traffic will be routed to one of the two ips (depending on the order they were added)\n\nWhat should happen:\ntraffic to flat_interface should not be snatted\ntraffic to vlan10 should be snatted to 10.1.0.2\ntraffic to vlan11 should be snatted to 192.168.0.2",
