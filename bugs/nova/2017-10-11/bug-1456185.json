As a result, I don't see how this feature could have been marked as implemented without changing the spec or adding these features. Since neither was done, this feature should be added to truly complete the specification.\n\nThis information was accurate as of the latest HEAD of 'stable/kilo' (36fb002) and 'master' ('e77541c').",
