            "content": "the problem is that the manager (and probably in the future the api) is the one that calls initialize_connection.  It has to pass in info about where the connection will be coming from, but perhaps we could make initiator optional, as in if it can't find the initiator name, it won't pass it in initialize_connection.  If the receiving volume driver needs iscsi and it isn't set it can return an error.\n\nWould that work?",
