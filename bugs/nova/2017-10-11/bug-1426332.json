Use it only on test environments):\n1) stop nova-compute service\n2) remove nova-compute service from DB, for example node-foo:\nuse nova;\ndelete from compute_nodes where hypervisor_hostname='node-foo';\ndelete from services where host='node-foo';\n3) Set enable_new_services=False in nova.conf\n4) start nova-compute service\n5) check nova service-list and launch instance, as an option",
