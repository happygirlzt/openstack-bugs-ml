In this case we should still\n    be injecting the instance metadata.\n    \n    The current code is inconsistent between spawn and migrations.\n    \n    The correct approach is to always inject the data into xenstore.\n    \n    fixes bug 1188618\n    \n    Change-Id: I253b34234544cff353985a5b53ec084ea332535a\n",
