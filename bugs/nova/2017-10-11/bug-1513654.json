    "description": "I use qcow images and have disk_allocation_ratio == 2.1 to allow large amounts of overcommitting of disk space.  To quote the nova config reference:\n\n>  If the value is set to >1, we recommend keeping track of the free disk space, as the value approaching 0 may result in the incorrect \n>     functioning of instances using it at the moment.\n\nGood advice, but 'keeping track' can be a bit impractical at times.  I just now had the scheduler drop a large sized instance onto a server with a 98% full drive since the behavior of disk_allocation_ratio intentionally ignores the actual free space on the drive.\n\nI propose that we add an additional config setting to the disk scheduler so that I can overschedule but can /also/ request that the scheduler stop piling things onto an already groaning server.",
