It does the host OS integration/setup tasks, and it returns\n    the libvirt xml. In some cases, only the libvirt xml is required,\n    and the setup tasks are not necessary.\n    \n    The following patch separates the setup tasks and libvirt xml return\n    in connect_volume. A new method, called get_config, is added to just\n    return the xml config, separate from the connect_volume method.\n    The connect_volume method will continue to return the libvirt xml,\n    so that existing functionality is not broken. This way, get_config\n    can be used to get the libvirt xml without any side-effects, e.g.\n    re-running shell commands to setup the volume.\n    \n    There will be a follow up patch, where libvirt's driver.py will\n    switch over to use get_config and connect_volume will no longer\n    need to return the libvirt xml.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5d300f8fe99f714d63d51197dc89f556c3a5d43b\n    Related-Bug: #1359617\n",

The following patch changes libvirt driver\n    to call the appropriate volume method, get_config or\n    connect_volume, instead of the old monolithic call to\n    connect_volume. connect_volume will no longer need to return\n    the libvirt xml after this switch over. This will improve\n    performance and eliminate possible race conditions.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0d0d7ba98c53ad7509c28bb4866c488c0a049d2f\n    Closes-Bug: #1359617\n",
