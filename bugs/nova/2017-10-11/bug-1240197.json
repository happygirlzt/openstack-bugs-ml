            "content": "I was looking for something to implement as my first patch and this sounds interesting. I did some poking around and found that nova uses Oslo.config which doesn't seem to support an `auto'-like feature. However, I do see this line[1] in nova/cmd/all.py -\n\n    launcher.launch_service(server, workers=server.workers or 1)\n\nwhich essentially starts worker processes. Does it make sense to detect the number of CPUs here and set that instead of 1?\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/cmd/all.py#L59",
