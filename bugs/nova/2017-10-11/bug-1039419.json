It is no problem.\n\nWhen it is called with admin role, list_networks() returns networks owned by other tenants in addition to the above. To eliminate networks owned by other tenants, nova calls list_networks() with tenant_id filter. But by this filter, public networks are also eliminated.\n\nIn my  patch, nova calls list_networks() twice: One call is with tenant_id filter and the other call with shared=True.",
