This operation will require the guest agent to be\n    configured and running in order to be able to run. However, this operation\n    will not be disruptive.\n    \n    This code is similar to a change that has been commited to oVirt.\n    https://gerrit.ovirt.org/#/c/50426\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1593745\n    Change-Id: I2732af50aab238502ccdc067f62290fd962c8c64\n",
