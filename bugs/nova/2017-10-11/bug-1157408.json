To be compatible with\n    cells, volume_detach() should as well.  Also change it to accept the\n    volume object, instead of just a volume ID.  This lets us proxy the\n    volume object to child cells a bit more easily.\n    \n    This removes 2 skipTests that we have related to volumes and cells.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1157408\n    \n    There was also a check that if instance_get_by_uuid() returned no\n    instance, it VolumeUnattached should be raised.  However, this check\n    would never work as InstanceNotFound would have been raised.  This\n    patch also corrects that.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ide35ad5d8e147f6bd21b5840b901363dab0eae38\n",
