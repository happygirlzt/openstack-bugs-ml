You can enter following command to verify.\n> sudo iscsiadm -m node --rescan\nIt will display the session which was build in previous steps.\nOf course, you can also find device will still exist in /sys/block\n\nBecause of nova will search all block devices which are defined in xml for all guest.\nThen nova will disconnect ISCSI block which was existed in /dev/disk/by-path and didn't been define in any guest.\nBut paused instance's xml define will still contain dev which prefer to remove.\nTherefore nova will not disconnect with this volume.\n\nThere are two kind solution:\n1. Logout iscsci connection manually. (sudo iscsiadm -m node -T Target --logout)\n2. Reattach same volume.(lol)\n\nBut we still need to handle this bug with paused instance.",
