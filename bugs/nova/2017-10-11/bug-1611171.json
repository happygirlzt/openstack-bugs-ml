Looking at the original bug - bug #805695 - I suspect the reasoning for this was logfiles ending up as owned by the root user, so sudo'ing to nova meant they were created as the correct use.\n\nI'm left wondering how this affects services today, do we still have this issue? I've marked my Designate patch WIP as I'd like to walk through that possibility and see what other use cases shake out from others on this bug.\n\n(That said - I'd very much like to remove this, there rarely a good reason to sudo on behalf of a user like this, and it's a pet peeve of mine with the typical `curl | bash` quick installs  - that and running apt-get install with --yes without asking me ;))",
