As a result, calls that reference or join SecurityGroup.instances (such as security_group_get_by_name()) become slow for a project over time.\n\nThis becomes a serious performance issue for highly active projects that add and remove instances with great frequency.  On Nebula, one highly active project takes over 23 seconds to perform a describe-groups call, and several minutes for run-instances to return to the api caller.\n\nSome related issues:\n\n* The SecurityGroups.instances association does not filter deleted security_group_instance_association's\n* Deleting a security_group does not delete related security_group_instance_association's",
