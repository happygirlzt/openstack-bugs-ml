    "description": "The nova code has a mixed usage of `range` and `xrange`.\n\nThe `xrange` usage is preferred on py2 environments because it makes use of a generator rather than attempting to construct an entire list in memory. In py3, however, the `xrange` built-in no longer exists because it has been renamed `range`.\n\nThis could cause several problems. The use of `range` in py2 for any significant size input will have a noticeable impact on performance. The use of `xrange` in py3 will cause a `NameError`.\n\nThis is a case where the most appropriate solution is to break from the HACKING.rst guidelines and shadow a built-in and make `range` and alias for `xrange` in py2 environments. This would allow us to normalize the usage of `range` vs `xrange` as well as ensure that all calls to `range` are using the version with the best performance.",
