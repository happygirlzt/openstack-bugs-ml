Right now oslotest is a runtime dependency of nova which is wrong since oslotest.base is only used for nova unit tests, so it should be in test-requirements.txt.\n\nThis is especially bad for downstream packagers/deployers because the runtime dependencies for oslotest include things like mock and mox, which shouldn't be in a production install of openstack.",
