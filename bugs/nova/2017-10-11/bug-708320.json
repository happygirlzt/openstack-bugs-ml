I don't think a fix is necessary.\n\nI alto think that in the case of the call by admin it's reasonable displaying all allocated floating/elastic IPs  regardless of the owner.\n\nMy point is that only Floating IPs/Elastic IPs allocated by AllocateAddress call should be displayed.\nIn other word, DescribeAddresses call should not return any address without AllocateAddress calls in the case of EC2 API.\n\nAt this moment, all floating IPs are displayed even including network address and broadcast address by euca-describe addresses.\n\nI know Floating IP and Elastic IP(or public IP) are different somehow, and I will check both cases. \nGive me time a little bit.\n\nRegards,\n\n-Masanori\n\n\n\n\n",
