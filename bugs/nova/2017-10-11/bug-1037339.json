I had already planned to send a patch to remove the arch filter if/when this was accepted, and I decided it was best to just fold into the existing arch filter after reading Vish's suggestion in the review comments.\n\nStill, much of commit 31336b35 can be removed since arch is one of the triplets in the supported_instances list. \n\nI'll see about posting some patches later tonight or tomorrow.",

E.g. a qemu host can support the following types of instances\n\n[(i686, qemu, hvm), (x86_64, qemu, hvm), (arm, qemu, hvm), (microblaze, qemu, hvm), (microblazeel, qemu, hvm), (mips, qemu, hvm), (mipsel, qemu, hvm), (sparc, qemu, hvm), (ppc, qemu, hvm), (ppc64, qemu, hvm), (s390x, qemu, hvm)]\n\nwhereas a kvm host supports \n\n[(i686, kvm, hvm), (x86_64, kvm, hvm), (i686, qemu, hvm), (x86_64, qemu, hvm)]\n\nand a Xen host supports\n\n[(i686, xen, xen), (x86_64, xen, xen), (i686, xen, hvm), (x86_64, xen, hvm)]\n\nSo I will move d39137fa to the arch filter and remove permitted_instance_types from the libvirt driver.",

I'm surprised the pep8 tests are passing due to excessive line lengths in doc/source/devref/filter_scheduler.rst and etc/nova/nova.conf.sample.   Perhaps such files aren't covered in the tests?   Not sure the best way to handle wrapping long lines in those files, so any advice is appreciated.\n\nI'll still need to cook up a patch to remove permitted_instance_types.  It is late here, so will take care of it tomorrow.",

The existing ArchFilter\n    already filtered on architecture. This patch merges the ComputeFilter\n    functionality introduced in d39137fa with the ArchFilter to create the\n    ImagePropertiesFilter.  The ImagePropertiesFilter uses image properties\n    specified in the request_spec to filter hosts.\n    \n    This patch also adds the ImagePropertiesFilter to the list of default\n    filters specified by the scheduler_default_filters FLAG.\n    \n    Fixes LP Bug #1037339\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifa6fccf2db266b0fe3457d58fc81fdb50ffcbc0f\n",
