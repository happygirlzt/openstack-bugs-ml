Modifications and another \"raise\" work just fine.\n\nAnother issue is with stacked exception handling - the following pattern will always throw Exception('bad'), rather than what's in e1. This can be fixed by moving cleanup to a different function.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0try:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0f()\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0except Exception, e1:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0try:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0raise Exception('bad')\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0except Exception, e2:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pass\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0raise\n\nThose patterns may be nice candidates to check in hacking.py in the future.",
