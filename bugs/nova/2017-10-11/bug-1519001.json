It should reset\n    the count to 0 before counting the resourcet racker's\n    view. this is done for other resources (memory, disk)\n    in _update_usage_from_instances().\n    \n    This was not caught in unit tests because they always\n    provide a virt driver view with no resource used for\n    tests that assume instances are already running.\n    \n    This patch adds the reset to 0 and modifies the\n    tests to provide correct counts of used resources\n    from the virt driver.\n    \n    Change-Id: I21acfd7d5b5ed442cd1e9049c986a06bd2b59b81\n    Closes-Bug: #1519001\n",
