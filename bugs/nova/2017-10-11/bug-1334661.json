In cinder also it is trying to import 'rpc' module from\nopenstack comman packge, but 'rpc' module is present in cinder package.\nhttps://github.com/openstack/cinder/blob/master/cinder/openstack/common/service.py#L47\n\nBecause of this I taught that we fix this in oslo-incubator and then sync to specific projects.",
