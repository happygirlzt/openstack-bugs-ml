This means that in the event of a host\n    crash we may be left with only the file metadata when the host comes\n    back up: i.e. an empty file of the correct size. Nova cannot detect\n    this data corruption, so operator intervention is required.\n    \n    By adding an fdatasync() before closing the file handle we ensure that\n    the downloaded file is either entirely present, or entirely not\n    present.\n    \n    See also change I33bd99b0, which fixes this issue for downloads\n    requiring a subsequent conversion step.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1669844\n    Change-Id: Id9905a87f16f66530623800e33e2581c555ae81d\n",

A host crash at this point\n    will leave a file with the correct metadata (name, size, ownership,\n    permissions), but no contents. This will prevent qcow2 instances on\n    that compute host which use that image from restarting, and requires\n    manual intervention from an operator to fix.\n    \n    See also change Id9905a87, which fixes this issue for downloads\n    without a conversion.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1669844\n    Change-Id: I33bd99b0752111ff7057f9bd40e58dcde77c7d95\n",
