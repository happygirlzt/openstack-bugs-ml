    "description": "While testing some error message responses on the Nova floating-ips API extension, I found that if an IP is requested from a pool that has no more IPs and if the OpenStack is configured to use Neutron, the server throws back an HTTP 500 because the extension doesn't handle the NeutronClientException. The extension looks like it expects a Nova exception for not enough floating IPs instead.\n\nSeems like the extension just needs to be updated.",
