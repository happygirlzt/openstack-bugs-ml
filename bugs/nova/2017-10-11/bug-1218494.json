Everything seems to work perfectly: VM's have external access, I can ping the VM's from the virtual router, VM's can communicate between themselves...\n\nHowever, I am unable to ping the VM's from any compute node to the VM's. I have added the virtual router to the routing table, I changed the default security permissions... \n\npracticas@lemarq:~$ route\nKernel IP routing table\nDestination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface\ndefault         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 br-ex\n10.5.5.0        192.168.0.100   255.255.255.0   UG    0      0        0 br-ex  # VIRTUAL ROUTER\n192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 br-ex\n192.168.100.0   *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth1\n\npracticas@lemarq:~$ nova secgroup-list-rules default\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+\n| IP Protocol | From Port | To Port | IP Range  | Source Group |\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+\n| icmp        | -1        | -1      | 0.0.0.0/0 |              |\n| tcp         | 1         | 65535   | 0.0.0.0/0 |              |\n+-------------+-----------+---------+-----------+--------------+\n\n\nIn order to prove that it is a problem with nova security permissions I have done the following experiment.
