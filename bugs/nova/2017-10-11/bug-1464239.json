The nova metadata server started to return /dev/sdb as the ephemeral0 path, whereas before it returned /dev/sda1, which was the default set in the Ironic driver.  The patch caused this default to be overridden.\n\nMy proposed patch only fixes the regression, but there's still an issue here because if the ephemeral partition doesn't end up on /dev/sda1 the metadata will still be wrong.  I've opened https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1478065  to track that.",
