    "description": "AWS CLI is a recommended Amazon's CLI and it uses botocore library instead of boto to access EC2 API:\nhttp://aws.amazon.com/cli/\n\nAmazon's URL for AWS EC2 API is: \nhttps://ec2.amazonaws.com/\n\nOpenStack nova's EC2 API service URL is: \nhttp://some.server.com:8773/services/Cloud\n\nAWS CLI works with the root URLs (without something trailing, like ../services/Cloud). This is so because of the following bug in botocore:\nhttps://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/420\n\nWe did supply the fix here:\nhttps://github.com/Andrey-mp/botocore/commit/162bdc22de3ff3d6243459c132ca9bd01e02533f\n\nHowever, we do not control botocore and cannot predict when this fix is going to be applied or guarantee that in the future nothing alike happens again (in fact, older botocore didn't have this bug).\nAnother problem is that there is a set of Tempest tests currently used to work against stackforge/ec2-api but which is about to be employed against nova's ec2-api. These Tempest tests use botocore too. And won't work with the nova's EC2-API until either botocore or nova is fixed.\n\nSo we suggest to fix the situation in nova by changing the URL to http://some.server.com:8773/.\nIt'll provide the solution for OpenStack independent of botocore bugs and fixes in this area, and will make the service URL more alike (compatible, sort of) with the AWS EC2 API.",
