    "description": "\nI am using a two node setup/ install of Openstack with Quantum (using devstack). \nThe devstack cloned the code on Oct 29th. I am running ubuntu-12.04 on two 1RU servers with Intel Xeon processors (64 bit) with 4 cores. \n\nThe first node (node-1) is the nova-controller and also the quantum server (dhcp agent, l3 agent, ovs plugin). \nThe second node (node-2) is the compute node and runs n-cpu along with the quantum agents for ovs plugin. The connectivity is based on VLANs. \nnode-1 also runs n-cpu so vm instances can also be placed on the controller. \n\nI booted up two instances as follows: \n\nnova --os-tenant-name vinay --os-password vinay boot --flavor 1 --image ea777c38-5eca-4f07-a677-83ea4f8c2c7c --nic net-id=142207b2-e6cf-427d-aa91-8b2ba1788bb5 demo-vm-2\n\n\nnova --os-tenant-name vinay --os-password vinay boot --flavor 1 --image ea777c38-5eca-4f07-a677-83ea4f8c2c7c --nic net-id=142207b2-e6cf-427d-aa91-8b2ba1788bb5 demo-vm-2\n\nOne vm lands on node-1 and the second vm lands on node-2. They get their IP address from DHCP server and both vm's can ping each other and everything is fine. \n\nHowever, when I try to access novnc console using the following command :\nnova get-vnc-console fd6c6d07-c950-41c9-b7c4-da40288e63f5 novnc\n\nI am always getting getting connected to the vm on node-1. The \"nova get-vnc-console ...\" returns separate urls for novnc console access. However they always connect to the vm on node-1. \n\nIs this a known issue? Has anyone else seen it?",
