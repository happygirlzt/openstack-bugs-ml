    "description": "Using CEPH RBD as our ephemeral drive led to an issue when upgrading from Kilo to Liberty. Our environment has \"force_config_drive = True\".\n\nIn Icehouse, Juno, and Kilo, this uses an ISO 9660 image created in /var/lib/nova/instances/$UUID/disk.config\n\nHowever, in Liberty, if using CEPH RBD for ephemeral, there is a switch to putting this in rbe like this:\n\nrbd:instances/${UUID}_disk.config\n\nWhile this works GREAT for new VMs, it is problematic with existing VMs as not all transition states were considered. In particular, if you do a \n\nnova stop $UUID\n\nfollowed by a \n\nnova start $UUID\n\nyou will find your instance still in the stopped state. There is something in the start code that ASSUMES that the new rbd format will be in place (but it doesn't actually create it.)\n\nThere is a work around if you find instances in that state, simply cold migrate them with\n\nnova migrate $UUID\n\nwhich redoes the config.drive plumbing and creates the rbd:instances/${UUID}_disk.config\n\nOur permanent work around has been to prepopulate the rbd via a script though getting this bug fixed would be much better.\n\nLiberty is a stable release and this is a loss of service type of bug so should get fixed. Not clear if this is also an issue (likely so) in Mitaka/Newton as we haven't got an environment yet to test it, but presumably with long running VMs from early config drive, it would also exist in Mitaka.\n\nSpecifics:\nLiberty Nova\nnova:12.0.2-38-g7bc3355.13.1b76006\n\nCEPH:\n0.94.6-1trusty\n\nHost OS:\nUbuntu Trusty",
