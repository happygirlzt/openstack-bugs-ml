Before, traceback info were\n    converted to a string before being sent to the conductor. Now, since\n    the object method being used remotes itself, the order becomes the\n    opposite and any captured tracebacks are sent as is, resulting in\n    errors during messaging.\n    \n    This adds a serialize_args decorator for this case, which handles\n    this specific case for the event_finish_with_failure() classmethod.\n    A more generic approach is needed, and that will be applied to the\n    also-affected but currently-unused finish_with_failure() instance\n    method.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibedddd606b9d25ffbbb2b1b5358cf0aa4741083f\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: #1317804\n",
