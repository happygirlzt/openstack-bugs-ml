And then I got a response with code 500.\nIn nova CLI, when params are wrong you will get a notice, but in REST you get nothing.\nIf openstack use json schema to describe every REST API and verify json requested , users can easily know how to use these API and which attribute was wrong.",

We don't want 500's occurring because they cause big LOG messages.",
