This sets up a circular dependency\n    which prevents driver.py importing vif.py in the top of the file,\n    since the CONF.libvirt.virt_type parameter won't have been\n    registered yet.\n    \n    It is generally bad design practice to rely on global variables,\n    which is effectively what the CONF.* parameters are, so change\n    the VIF driver get_config() API to accept 'virt_type' as a\n    parameter instead.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1302796\n    Change-Id: I023851df96640eeeb54124add8cc5c725b8d13be\n",
