Currently they are zeroed every time\n    we change something in the table.  This will allow users to better\n    analyze usage for instances over an extended period of time, for\n    example, for billing purposes.\n    \n    Change all applicable iptables, libvirt and Xen tests to account\n    for the changes made to support the packet:byte counts.\n    \n    This work uncovered two bugs in the existing implementation\n    found during my testing, specifically:\n    \n    1. Fix IptablesManager to clean-up non-wrapped chains correctly,\n       instead of leaving them in the kernel's table.  We now keep a\n       list of chains and rules we need to remove, and double-check\n       in apply() that they are filtered-out.\n    \n    2. Fix IptablesManager to honor \"top=True\" iptables rules by only\n       adding non-top rules after we've gone through all the top rules\n       first.\n    \n    Implements first work item of blueprint libvirt-network-usage.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1037127 and bug 1037137.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia5a11aabbfb45b6c16c8d94757eeaa2041785b60\n",
