This patch fixes it up by\n    adding new methods in network.api to moving them to the destination\n    node.\n    \n    Also adds the new methods to network/quantumv2/api.py. They do nothing\n    but pass for now.\n    \n    This patch updates network RPC API to version 1.1\n    \n    Fixes bug 1053344\n    \n    Change-Id: If9f30050d37831f108ac4a1c8a018d820818f3b6\n",
