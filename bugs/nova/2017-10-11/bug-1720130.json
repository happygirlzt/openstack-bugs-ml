    "description": "In order to map instances, nova-manage takes the DB info of the cells from the config file (so by default this points to cell0 in nova.conf) and so for every new cell created, in order to do the map_instances, the correct config file has to be specified in addition to the --cell_uuid option that is provided i.e like this :\n\nnova-manage --config-file /etc/nova/nova_cell2.conf cell_v2 map_instances --cell_uuid \"\"\n\nSo it is better if this info is taken from the cell_mappings table inside the API database. Basically query for the database_connection column value of the cell provided, from the cell_mappings table in nova-api DB and map the unmapped instances to the --cell_uuid that is provided.",
