According to NIST, key lengths shorter than 2048 bits have been regarded as deprecated since 2011, and will be disallowed after 2013:\n\nhttp://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-131A/sp800-131A.pdf\n\nIndeed, the ssh-keygen utility in recent versions of both Ubuntu and Fedora already generates 2048-bit keys by default.\n\nRather than force a particular key length, Nova should defer to the distro's default RSA key length in ssh-keygen, since this is more likely to be updated in accordance with the latest appropriate security advice.",
