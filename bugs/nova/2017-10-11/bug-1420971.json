Also fixes a typo in\n    param help section.\n    \n    Also added code to ensure that non-existing transport_iface is not\n    provided, in which case we we log a warning and fall back to the\n    default instead of failing as would have previously happened.\n    \n    There is no change in functionality, this will just ensure that\n    documentation is not misleading.\n    \n    Originally added in commit 554647a4deee6ece221eb79fc93551de72b17ae3.\n    \n    DocImpact - due to the renamed config option\n    Closes-Bug: #1420971\n    Change-Id: I6c190328803e8efcde34d522e2c1814ef6afc220\n",
