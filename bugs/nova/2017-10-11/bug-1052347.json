It appears that ignoring the host parameter when the user is not admin is by design. According to the current implementation when there is any parameter not applicable to a non-admin user, it is removed and the rest of the command options are processed. I'll try to bring this to notice to a reviewer/approver.\n\nThanks,\nSubashini",
