We know that duplicate floating rules will never work, so\n    even if we have had other failures there is no need to create duplicate\n    forward rules. This patch fixes the issue by removing all existing\n    forwards for a floating ip before adding new ones. It adds a method\n    to IptablesTable to remove rules by regex and includes tests for new\n    method and the specific case of a duplicate forward.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1133527\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf5df8406fc49e92bac328cd81ffda1969b77d68\n",
