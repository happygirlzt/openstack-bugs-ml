And when the unrescue logic is run all rescued instances are unrescued no matter how short of a time they have been in that state.  At least with the Xen driver.",

It also now performs the unrescue through the compute api in\n    order to make sure the database is left in a consistent state.\n    \n    The poll_rescued_instances method is no longer necessary in the virt\n    driver interface and has been removed.  And also removed from the\n    different virt drivers, since it was just doing a 'pass' in each of\n    them.\n    \n    bug 1088625\n    bug 1088627\n    \n    Change-Id: I75f7dc188cc49e5f6e5c8a3cb256d1c42ff7d882\n",
