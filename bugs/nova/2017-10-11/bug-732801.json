The first step is to figure out why the failed VMs are showing up as 'active' instead of 'failed'\n2. Once that's fix, planning to write a test harness that spins up 10 instances and see how many fail.",

In the case of my system, it appears to be a race condition where the device node isn't created quickly enough.\n\nudevsettle (or udevadm settle) is likely to work, but it assumes a system is running udev. I've attached a patch which just polls until the device is created, which appears to be what most other code in nova does already in similar situations.",
