It also seems to stop further consumes from the rabbit queue.\n\nEssentially what happened here is that there was some old messages in the rabbit queue that had the previous version of RequestContext encoded. Ie, 'strategy' was in the message.  Due to how RequestContext.from_dict() creates a class instance by doing cls(**kwargs)... this traceback occurs.",
