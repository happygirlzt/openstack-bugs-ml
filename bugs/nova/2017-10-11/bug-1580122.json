Citing from the MS documentation, this is not supported:\n\n\u201cAccessing a continuously available file share as a loopback share is not supported. For example, if Microsoft SQL Server or Hyper-V store data files on SMB file shares, they must run on computers that are not a member of the file server cluster for the SMB file shares.\u201d\n\nThis is troublesome for the Hyper-C scenario, as Hyper-V will attempt to modify the image ACLs, making them unusable. The easy fix is to simply check if the share is local, and use the local path in that case.",
