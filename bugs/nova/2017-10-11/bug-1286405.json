            "content": "That the boot actually appears to 'succeed' was a source of confusion on more than one occasion.\n\nThere are actually two issues:\n\n1. The ova file uploaded to glance it actually a tar bundle containing within it the actual disk image that we need to boot the instance with. So the OVA image downloaded from glance will require further processing to extract the needed file.\n2. The extracted VMDK is in the streamOptimized format, which until recently, cannot be properly handled by the VMware drivers.\nWith the introduction of the oslo.vmware (https://github.com/openstack/oslo.vmware) library, it is now possible to use said format.\n\nI will provide a fix to do the necessary processing in 1. as well as leverage the functionality provided by oslo.vmware",
