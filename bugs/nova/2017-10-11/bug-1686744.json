    "description": "After the cell-ification of the aggregates API, it is not possible to add a compute to an aggregate if that compute does not expose any ComputeNode objects. This can happen  if the hash ring does not allocate any ironic nodes to one of the computes (i.e. more services than ironic nodes) or if there are not yet any nodes present in ironic. You get the following message:\n\n openstack aggregate add host baremetal-hosts overcloud-controller-0.localdomain\n\n Result:\n Host 'overcloud-controller-0.localdomain' is not mapped to any cell (HTTP 404) (Request-ID: req-\n 42525c1d-c419-4ea4-bb7c-7caa1d57a613)\n\nThis is confusing because the service is exposed in service-list and should be a candidate for adding to an aggregate.",

This is normally fine, but for weird drivers such\n    as ironic, there may be valid cases (i.e. during setup) where no ironic\n    nodes are present, thus one or more services may not have any compute node\n    records, and thus cannot be added to aggregates.\n    \n    This adds a cell scan, only if necessary, to find the desired service so\n    that the operation may proceed as it did before. To do this, we refactor\n    the _find_service() helper to a more generic utility and use that if we\n    don't find a HostMapping during the add operation.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idc97126d63684e7d638b974d7226ff210c744404\n    Closes-Bug: #1686744\n",
