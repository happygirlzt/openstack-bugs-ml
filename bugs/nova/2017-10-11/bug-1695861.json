    "description": "According to the parse_availability_zone() of the API class [1], Nova has a legacy hack to allow admins to specify hosts via an availability zone using az:host:node. That means ':' cannot be included in the name of an availability zone itself. However, the create aggregate API accepts requests which have availability zone names including ':'. That causes a following bad scenario:\n\n1. An admin creates a host aggregate with availability_zone = bad:name:example\n2. An admin tries to create a server with availability_zone = bad:name:example\n3. The nova-api parse the request and split the availability_zone value with ':'\n4. Then it recognizes az=bad, host=name, node=example\n5. Nova returns 'No valid host found' because there is no availability zone whose name is 'bad'.\n\nTo solve this problem following fixes are needed:\n\nOption A:\n* Do not allow admins to create a host aggregate whose availability_zone name including ':'.\n* Document this specification.\n\nOption B:\n* Deprecate the legacy admin hack which uses  az:host:node and allow ':' for az name.\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/gitweb?p=openstack/nova.git;a=blob;f=nova/compute/api.py;h=46ed8e91fcc16f3755fd6a5e2e4a6d54f990cb8b;hb=HEAD#l561",
