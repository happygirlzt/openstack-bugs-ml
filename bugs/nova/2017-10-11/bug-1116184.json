I'd consider this a minor information leak (since in most cases the attacker would already know he is attacking a Nova service so he should only retrieve info he already has), and not worth a formal advisory. Feel free to propose a patch publicly to fix this.\r\n\r\nI'll open this bug unless someone thinks it's a bad idea.",
