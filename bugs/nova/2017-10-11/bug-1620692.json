    "description": "When using the filter_scheduler with 400 hosts (not a very large number) and debug logging turned on, scheduling times start taking a very long time. With debug logging on, select_destinations() can swing anywhere between 3 and 18 seconds. With debug logging off, select_destinations() takes 0-4 seconds (http://paste.openstack.org/show/566153/).\n\nThe main problem is https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/scheduler/host_manager.py#L162-L178 because in a 400 host environment, it's trying to log debug 1600 times on every instance boot.",
