Run nova-api service as a daemon.\n2. Send SIGHUP signal to nova-api service.\n   kill -1 <parent_process_id_of_nova_api>\n\nAfter getting SIGHUP signal all the processes of nova-api stops instantly, without completing existing request, which might cause failure.\nIdeally after getting the SIGHUP signal nova-api process should stop getting new requests and wait for existing requests to complete before terminating all the processes and restarting all nova-api processes.",
