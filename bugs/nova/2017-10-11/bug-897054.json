This is no longer being caught though, because some idiot (Bug #884018) put a URLError handler above the HTTPError handler, but HTTPError is a subclass of URLError, so the HTTPError handler is no longer reached.\n\nInstead, you get an AttributeError on e.reason, because HTTPError does not have a reason field.
