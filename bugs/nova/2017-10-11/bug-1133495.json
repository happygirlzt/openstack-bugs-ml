It reduces the sql queries down a lot but it still isn't 100% correct.\n\nThe number of rows will be the number of hosts that are in the same aggregate as the host you choose. Not ideal but still better than the 300K+ rows being returned originally.\n\nWould be nice to get it to return the correct result. It can produce the correct sql when you remove the primaryjoins too but it breaks a lot of tests and  I don't know enough about sqlalchemy to figure out what's going on.",
