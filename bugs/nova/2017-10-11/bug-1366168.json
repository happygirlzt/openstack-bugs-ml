            "content": "@Sean Dague thank you for your comment.\n\nCopy the flavor info into metadata is definitely a good idea to do the show case.\n\nYou mentioned \"accurate\", just like  https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1276371, copy flavor info from beginning is one method, and disable creating instance with the same flavor id is another more simple way. And there won't be update operation for a flavor.\n\nMy concern about my current solution is it didn't disable create flavor with the same uuid - but it won't break things as in the access now using auto-increased id as foreign key. Further, some other parts need to be update as well - only do accessibility checking while boot instance and list flavor operation,  \n\nAnd never delete the flavor access means keep the relationship between tenant and flavor they used to have, and delete a flavor (if I'm not wrong) means no more instances could be created with it. And copy flavor info into metadata is a sort of dis-connect the relationship of instance and flavor ( is that our expected ?) - if one day there is a requirement querying all instance with the same flavor.\n\nFor long term, regarding to \"copy\" flavor info into metadata, I think you want say change how user retrieve their instance profile - from flavor to instance metadata, and to avoid data copy what we probably want to do is \"when people retrieve instance profile via metadata api, don't check their flavor accessibility\" - since when they created it they already got access for sure.  I think change set in nova part won't be too much, but it would impact all related projects's behaviours.  I believe it will take longer, and definitely a BP level update instead of bug fix.  And if there was already a BP aiming to achieve that, glad to contribute !\n\nLet me know your opinion. Thanks advanced.\n---\nWei Tie\n\n\n\nOn 8 Sep, 2014, at 10:01 pm, Sean Dague <email address hidden> wrote:\n\n> I think we need to do what we did with other InstanceType info and copy\n> it into the Instance metadata so it lives with the instance.
