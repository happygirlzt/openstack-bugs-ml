The current code store the connection_info in memory or in memcached if available.\n\nLooking at the code, we need to update Console classes to use the objects framework and let them handle the connection_info also remove the way that we use to store it in memory to use a real database. This is more than a but and a spec needs to spec provided for lemming.\n\nI will work on it.",
