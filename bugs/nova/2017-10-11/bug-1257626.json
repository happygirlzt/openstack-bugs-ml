For things that don't need\n    to be run as root, we should avoid this hit. Nova network does\n    this a lot and is also slow enough to cause trouble, so this\n    patch attempts to address that for a few situations.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1257626\n    \n    Change-Id: Idc26776bf96ccfd9f50383e9d40aa47397d4e2cf\n",
