We\n    should retry the upload on these types of errors.\n    \n    It is currently unclear where the signal comes from, so further\n    investigation is required to determine why the signal gets raised. It\n    does not appear that any services are restarting at the time the signal\n    gets raised.\n    \n    This change has also increased the coverage around the unit tests for\n    the glance upload, so we now test the try logic.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1207746\n    Change-Id: I116be92e153cf27c353cb20168a67b2c0b3cd595\n",
