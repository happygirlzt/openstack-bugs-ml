It could be reproduced by run command \"nova --debug resize\".  The response code of NoValidHost shoud be 500, I'm curious why the result is 202.\n\n2.I create another flavor to test if the number of vcpus is too many. \n\"flavor\": {\n              \"vcpus\": 1000,\n              \"ram\": 1024,\n              \"disk\": 20\n}\nThen I run \"nova resize\" with above flavorid. I found that /nova/filters.py  method \"get_filtered_objects\" does not check the vcpu resource. (I mean even the requested vcpus is too many, it does not raise the NoValidHost exception.)\n(Pdb) pp filter_classes\n[<class 'nova.scheduler.filters.retry_filter.RetryFilter'>,\n <class 'nova.scheduler.filters.availability_zone_filter.AvailabilityZoneFilter'>,\n <class 'nova.scheduler.filters.ram_filter.RamFilter'>,\n <class 'nova.scheduler.filters.compute_filter.ComputeFilter'>,\n <class 'nova.scheduler.filters.compute_capabilities_filter.ComputeCapabilitiesFilter'>,\n <class 'nova.scheduler.filters.image_props_filter.ImagePropertiesFilter'>]\n\nCould someone help answer my question 2?
