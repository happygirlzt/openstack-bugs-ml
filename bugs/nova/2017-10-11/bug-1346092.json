It's safer to use the library that only raises an exception in\n    case of a real problem.\n    \n    The only case where rbd CLI is still justified is import, which is\n    needed to correctly import sparse image files.\n    \n    All code related to cleanup of RBD volumes is moved to rbd.py, this\n    fixes a yo-yo problem with single-use methods scattered across 3\n    different files, and minimizes impact of this fix on imports in\n    imagebackend and utils.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1346092\n    Change-Id: I92cd6b16fbd93b377fe47b15d22efbbf68d02513\n    Signed-off-by: Dmitry Borodaenko <email address hidden>\n",
