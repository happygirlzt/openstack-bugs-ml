    "description": "Let's go in codes directly, to get resources from extension, the child class[0] has an __init__() to register itself, and the farther class [1]'s __init__() has already did this. If there are no some specified variables needed by child class, the child's __init__ could be removed. In <nova>/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/, nearly all of extensions class don't have such a duplicate __init__(). Removing the __init__() in child class could help keeping codes consistent and clean.\n\n[0] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib/fixed_ips.py#L88\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/api/openstack/extensions.py#L63",
