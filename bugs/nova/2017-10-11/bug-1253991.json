However changes to flavor defintions and supported os_types may make them obsolete.\n\nThe image clean-up code should recognise at least obsolete unused files (i.e size doesn't match any flavor, os_type doesn't match a defined mkfs command, not used by any instance) and remove them.\n\nIt woudl be nice if it also had an option to remove files that are not obsolete but are unused after some period.",
