This change is required to make that happen.  In a live\n    upgrade situation, you have icehouse nova infrastructure, with a mix of\n    havana and icehouse compute nodes as you roll through and upgrade them.\n    While in this situation, the havana compute nodes must be able to accept\n    3.0 messages.\n    \n    Accepting 3.0 messages is trivial to do and extremely low risk.  It does\n    not change the behavior of a havana-only deployment at all.  The only\n    additions is some pass-through code to the current compute manager.\n    This code will only get hit during a live upgrade situation.\n    \n    Note that there is one other change needed to complete this.  With only\n    this patch, live upgrades are supported, but any operations that require\n    compute nodes to talk to each other will not work.  This includes\n    resizes and migrates.  That would be unfortunate, since live migrations\n    are something that people *definitely* want to be able to do during an\n    upgrade procedure.\n    \n    The additional changes needed to allow resizes and migrates during live\n    upgrades are included in another patch.\n    \n    Partial-bug: #1258253\n    Change-Id: Ia801609b6b3fe88e0d0b16f4c0d37bf25dbfa842\n",

Specifically, these changes are needed\n    to allow resizes and migrates to work.  Before havana compute nodes get\n    put in a mixed environment with icehouse compute nodes, they need to be\n    speaking version 3.0 messages.\n    \n    Change-Id: If09bd38c9d8c3beb5b95107c497699dec47aa3ef\n    Closes-bug: #1258253\n",
