So while this is still an error (and the error message is indeed rather misleading), it doesn't affect the way quotas work. To reproduce the bug ensure that /etc/nova/nova.conf on controller node has 'quota_driver=nova.quota.NoopQuotaDriver' setting (restart nova-api service if you have changed it). \n\nHorizon user experience (as of J2 milestone) is probably not very good here, as it makes users think they *can* modify the quotas, when they actually *can't* do that, given the fact that NoopQuotaDriver is chosen. The proposed fix is to disable 'Modify Quota' button when quotas are disabled that way in Nova.",

This allows to avoid errors while trying to update\n    quotas which are disabled on service side. Also make disabled_quotas\n    collection to be a set instead of a list - this removes duplicate\n    fields that appear due to some possible quota overlaps between Nova\n    and Neutron.\n    \n    Also, since we dropped out python2.6 support fancy set literals and\n    dict comprehensions can be used.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Paul Karikh <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: #1286099\n    Change-Id: I10923f147e4c323aba8bbcc130d2016ad6725e86\n",
