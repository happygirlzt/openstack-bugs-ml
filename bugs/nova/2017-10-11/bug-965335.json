A single top level bullet for each extension would be more intuitive.\n\nA suggested fix is to update the template page so that\n - top line is extension name only (and make it obvious it must be edited)\n - there is an \"About This Extension\" sub section containing existing content\n - demote \"Summary of Changes\" so that it appears at same level as the new \"About This Extension\" sub-section, below the level of the name of this extension\n\nExisting extension documentation pages would then have to be updated to make them consistent.",
