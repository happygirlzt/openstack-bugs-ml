This practice makes it much more\n    difficult to discover the root-cause of issues in production by making\n    the message in the instance-faults table less useful.\n    \n    The solution is to have the original root-cause exception propogate all\n    the way up to the instance-faults table where the developer will be able\n    to make sense of it.\n    \n    Other cleanups:\n    \n    * Remove useless logging and stop logging opaque-refs in some places\n    \n    * Remove dead code (create_iscsi_storage)\n    \n    * Remove one-off functions (forget_sr_if_present,\n      introduce_sr_unless_present); just use forget_sr and introduce_sr\n    \n    * Removed unused `exception` import\n    \n    * Added Openstack copyright lines\n    \n    Future Work:\n    \n    There are lots of other places where unecessary exception handling is\n    occuring; this patch just addresses this in the attach/detach code-path.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1122733\n    \n    Change-Id: I8c382fb505303e604ff2e86afcf302efe3d6851d\n",
