According to Dan on\n    IRC, there's no danger here, but this is good to clean up regardless.\n    \n    From Dan: \"the only case where you'd have an issue is if you had a\n    conductor with the changeset before pci_request was added, and a compute\n    running the code after\"\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d8c1ac22fb50f25cee03bb230fccad2b18deaf5\n    Closes-bug: #1378461\n",
