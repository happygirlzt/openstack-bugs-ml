With the patch in place, the ssh session will be close during shutdown, because the sshd has the chance to close the connection before being brought down. Without the patch, the ssh session will just hang there for a while until timeout, because the connection is not promptly closed.\n\n\nTo leverage the clean shutdown feature, one can create a file named /etc/acpi/events/power that contains the following:\n\n              event=button/power\n              action=/etc/acpi/power.sh \"%e\"\n\nThen   create   a  file  named  /etc/acpi/power.sh  that  contains  whatever required to gracefully shutdown a particular server (VM).\nWith the apicd running, shutdown of the VM will cause  the rule in /etc/acpi/events/power to trigger the script in /etc/acpi/power.sh, thus cleanly shutdown the system.\n\n\n[Regression Potential]\n\n\u00a0* none\n\n\nCurrently in libvirt stop and delete operations simply destroy the underlying VM.

Some GuestOS's do not react well to this\n    type of power failure, and so it would be better if these operations\n    followed the same approach as soft_reboot and give the guest as\n    chance to shutdown gracefully.  Even where VM is being deleted,\n    it may be booted from a volume which will be reused on another\n    server.\n    \n    The change is implemented by adding a clean_shutdown parameter\n    to the relevant methods from the compute/api layer downwards\n    and into the virt drivers.  The implementation in the libvirt\n    driver is also provided.  Other drivers are modified just to\n    expect the additional parameter.\n    \n    The timer configuration value previous used by soft_reboot in\n    libvirt is moved up to virt/driver so it can be used by other drivers.\n    \n    The timer logic itself is changed from simple loop counting with one\n    second sleeps to a more precise approach, since testing showed that\n    other calls in the loop could introduce a difference of up to +50% on\n    the expected duration. This can extent the default two minute to\n    three minutes, which would not be acceptable in some environments\n    and breaks some of the tempest tests.\n    \n    A separate config value defines what the default shutdown\n    behaviour for delete should be (default False to keep compatibility\n    with current behaviour).\n    \n    This code is structured to enable a subsequent API change to add\n    clean/forced options to the stop and delete methods\n    \n    Also as a minor tidy-up moved the repeated definition of\n    FakeLoopingCall in test_libvirt be common across tests\n    \n    Partially-Implements: blueprint user-defined-shutdown\n    Closes-Bug: #1196924\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie69aa2621cb52d6fefdc19f664247b069d6782ee\n",

Some\n    GuestOS's do not react well to this type of power failure, and so it would\n    be better if these operations followed the same approach as soft_reboot\n    and give the guest as chance to shutdown gracefully.\n    \n    The shutdown behavior is defined by two values:\n    \n    - shutdown_timeout defines the overall period a Guest is allowed to\n    complete it's shutdown.  The default valus is set via nova.conf and can be\n    overridden on a per image basis by image metadata allowing different types\n    of guest OS to specify how long they need to shutdown cleanly.\n    \n    - shutdown_retry_interval defines how frequently within that period\n    the Guest will be signaled to shutdown.  This is a protection against\n    guests that may not be ready to process the shutdown signal when it\n    is first issued. (e.g. still booting).  This is defined as a constant.\n    \n    This is one of a set of changes that will eventually expose the choice\n    of whether to give the GuestOS a chance to shutdown via the API.\n    \n    This change implements the libvirt changes to power_off() and adds\n    a clean shutdown to compute.manager.stop().\n    \n    Subsequent patches will:\n    - Add clean shutdown to Shelve\n    - Add clean shutdown to Rescue\n    - Convert soft_reboot to use the same approach\n    - Expose clean shutdown via rpcapi\n    - Expose clean shutdown via API\n    \n    Partially-Implements: blueprint user-defined-shutdown\n    Closes-Bug: #1196924\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: I432b0b0c09db82797f28deb5617f02ee45a4278c\n",
