Reattempting establishment of nova-conductor connection...' error occurs in nova-compute.log if we just follow the install guide, The situation is as below:\n\non compute node\n1. no usable nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf\n2. only ipv4 of 'controller' (as rabbitmq server) is mapped in /etc/hosts\n3. use 'controller' as rabbitmq server in nova.conf\n\n==========================================================================\n\nThe eventlet greendns has been always enabled by monkey_patch since 0.20.0, and this will introduce some compatibility problems, e.g.\n\n1. We create a connection to rabbitmq server using 'controller:5672'\n2. patched socket.getaddrinfo('controller', 5672, 0) is called by amqp (0 for both ipv4 and ipv6)\n3. greendns will use '127.0.0.1' as dns nameserver if there is no usable nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf\n4. greendns will perform name resolving for 'controller', ipv6 dns lookup will be performed if there is no ipv6 mapping for 'controller' in /etc/hosts, so is ipv4. One of the dns lookup is leading to a timeout, and cause the problem mentioned above.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLooks like 'EVENTLET_NO_GREENDNS' option is disabled only in eventlet 0.20.0~0.20.1, and it's back in 0.21.0.\nBut for now eventlet 0.20.0 (from global-requirements) is used by all openstack services, temporarily we need to change the install guide for nodes to work well under greened dns:\n1. put a usable nameserver in resolv.conf on all nodes that install guide mentioned.\n2. or map both ipv4 and ipv6 address for rabbitmq server(e.g. controller) in /etc/hosts.",
