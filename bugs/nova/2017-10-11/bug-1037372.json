There might be two race conditions:\n    \n     1) two tasks are concurrently accepted by api, check task_state to be\n     None and allow the tasks to be executed concurrently.\n    \n     2) one ordinary task is running, so that task_state is set. The delete\n     task is accepted at API, and will \"take over\" and change task_state to\n     DELETING. However the first task may continue to update task_state or\n     set it to None as it finishes.\n    \n    This patch specifies current expected task_state when updating task_state.\n    If unexpected state is met, abort the task without updating. Various\n    compute tests are fixed accordingly to set the pre condition of the\n    task state.\n    \n    Part of bug 1037372\n    Change-Id: I5fdf0946c728a47febb56ad468043a828b2736c8\n",
