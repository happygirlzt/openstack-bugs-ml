Each element of this list has the same structure as the 'provider\n    network attributes'.\n    These attributes are:\n    - provider:network_type\n    - provider:physical_network\n    - provider:segmentation_id\n    \n    This patch will retrieve the relevant physical network name from a\n    multi-provider network\n    \n    Change-Id: Icb9a546e6fcbf399fcef3e9ea686b35ec3817cd5\n    Closes-Bug: #1659467\n    (cherry picked from commit b9d9d96a407db5a2adde3aed81e61cc9589c291a)\n",
