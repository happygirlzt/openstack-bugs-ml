    "description": "Kind of annoying, as we've had to go through a few iterations of fixes to get this right.  However, it seems openssl behaves rather weirdly.  When decrypting a base64 string, there needs to be a newline at the end.  When you're encoding, it encodes everything sent, including a newline.  The latter makes sense.  The former... eh, I dunno.  In any case, right now because we're always appending a newline when writing to stdin, openssl is encoding it with the password.  We need to only send a newline when decoding base64 data.",
