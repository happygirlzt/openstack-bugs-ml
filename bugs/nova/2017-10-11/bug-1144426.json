My vote would be what you propose to change source_group_id to remote_group_id and source_ip_prefix to remote_ip_prefix. \n\nI think remote_ip_prefix is also a better choice than ip_prefix because this value is never oneself. For example: \n\nremote_ip_prefix=1.1.1.1, direction=ingress # 1.1.1.1 can talk to you\nremote_ip_prefix=1.1.1.1, direction=egress # you can talk to 1.1.1.1\n\nI think remote_ makes things even more clear here.
