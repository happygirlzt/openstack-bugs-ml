Not doing so effectively makes the min/max options useless for anyone who wants to add their VMs into a DNS domain.\n\nWhen creating only instance its possible that the user wants to duplicate a name (they might be going on different networks and domains), but in the multiple instance case where all other parameters are identical its hard to see any advantage to having all instances start with the same hostname.\n\nIdeally the suffix would be configurable in some way by the user, but that would require an API change or extension, rasing this to the status of a blueprint.",
