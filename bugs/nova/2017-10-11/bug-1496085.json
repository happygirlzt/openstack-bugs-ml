If the MTU value is not supplied for Neutron then the instance has no way of determining what the correct MTU will be. The instance will use the default linux value, which may or may not be correct. Setting to 1500 is not safe, and is no better than using whatever the default linux value is.\n\nProbably not a nova bug. MTU value should be broadcast by neutron if having issues.",
