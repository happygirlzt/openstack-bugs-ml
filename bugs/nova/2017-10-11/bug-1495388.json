And the host update problem, I think you are right also, that isn't a problem.\n\n\n@Eli, thanks for working with me on this.\n\nAlso the display_name = \"-----\", will lead to instance.hostname = \"\"\n\nI think we should fix this.\n\nMy first idea is if the hostname become empty after strip invalid characters, we use \"server [uuid]\" instead of it.\n\nBut that still not good for non-english users. Maybe we can enable user to set hostname in the future with microversions",
