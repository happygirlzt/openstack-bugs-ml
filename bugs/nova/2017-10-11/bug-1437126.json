So you have just one conductor process.\n\nIf workers is more than 1 (say 3), then the parent starts as many workers specified, say 3 workers, so you will see a parent + 3 children.\n\nLet's take yet another case i have not specified any workers in my conf, so it picks up the numbers of processors which is 8 and then you will see 9 process(es), i.e. 1 parent and 8 workers!\n\nstack@dims-ubuntu:~$ ps -ef | grep nova-cond\nstack    25482 25431  0 10:48 pts/5    00:00:00 grep --color=auto nova-cond\nstack    31794 31682  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:00:01 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31836 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:06:06 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31837 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:05:58 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31838 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:07:23 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31839 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:07:27 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31840 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:06:03 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31841 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:07:22 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31842 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:06:05 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack    31843 31794  0 Mar24 pts/20   00:06:05 /usr/bin/python /usr/local/bin/nova-conductor --config-file /etc/nova/nova.conf\nstack@dims-ubuntu:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l\n8\n\nHope this helps, if this is not what you see, then please holler.",
