    "description": "Tested OpenStack version: IceHouse 2014.1, master branch still has this issue.\nHost version: CentOS 6, 2.6.32-431.el6.x86_64\n\nI have done some work to test the performance of LUN scanning with multipath, use the way like what Nova dose.\nIn my test, The host was connected with almost 900 LUNs.\n1. I use 'iscsiadm' with '--rescan' to discover LUNs, which takes almost 15s. It seems '--rescan' cause kernel to rescan all the LUNs which has already been connected to the host.\n2. I use 'multipath -r' to construct multipath devices, which takes almost 2 minutes. I found that 'multipath -r' will reconstructs all multipath devices against the LUNs \nThe two steps scans all of the LUNs, and totally costs more then 2 minutes.\n\nAccording to \"connect_volume\" in nova.virt.libvirt.volume.py: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py#L252, Nova also uses the tow steps to detect new multipath volume, this two steps will scan all of the LUNs, including all the others which already connected. So if a host has a large number of LUNs connected to it, the connect_volume will be very slow.\n\nI think connect_volume needn't scan all of the LUNs, only need scan the LUN specified by connection_info.",
