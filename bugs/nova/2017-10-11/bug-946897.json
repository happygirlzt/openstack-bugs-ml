However, I am trying to propose that nova-api should be more interactive to user requests.\n\nIt would be good if, during this long running 'euca-register [image_location]', nova-api could still respond to certain requests that can be done easily. For example, euca-describe-instances, euca-describe-volumes, and etc..\n\nIs it possible to run 'euca-register' in an additional thread, so that it is not blocked?  ",

In general registering images with ec2 semantics is painful in a number of ways, so we also tend to recommend that users use glance directly to upload images instead.\n\nVish",
