    "description": "When attaching Cinder volumes to an instance, Nova is setting the <serial> XML element to contain the UUID of the Cinder volume. The idea is that this is exposed to the guest OS, allowing it to setup a stable device path in /dev/disk/by-id/ to identify the device. \n\nThe problem of reliably identifying disks passed to an instance really applies to all disks, not merely those backed by Cinder volumes. As such Nova should apply a <serial> XML element to every disk that is configured.\n\nThe current approach of using a UUID doesn't really work for non-volume backed disks, since they have no UUIDs. Even for Cinder volumes the use of UUIDs is flawed, because they are too long to fit in the available space. As a result rather than the UUID, the guest OS is seeing a truncated UUID string. UUIDs are pretty user unfriendly too, whether truncated or not.\n\nWe ought to come up with a plan for better serial strings that can apply to all disks, and can avoid being truncated.",
