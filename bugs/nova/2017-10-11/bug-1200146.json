ISO 8601 seems to allow one to choose the separator between date and time parts (the default is 'T' char, but a space is also commonly used).\n3. We already have 3 different date time formats supported by _parse_datetime(). Adding of \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\" would fulfill the missing counterpart of \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f\" (the space is used as a separator, but microseconds part is missing).\n4. It's the format str() applied to datetime instances produces if they have the microseconds part equal to 0.\n\nSo it's completely optional. I thought, it would be convenient to have an additional datetime format here. If you think, it's not, I'll mark the bug as invalid.",
