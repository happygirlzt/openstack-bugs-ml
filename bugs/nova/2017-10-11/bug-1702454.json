    "description": "We added a new field in the RequestSpec object called 'requested_destination' and we began using it for evacuations by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/315572/ (Newton)\n\nThat object was tranformed into legacy dictionaries (called \"filter_properties\" and \"request_spec\") before being rehydrated for the rebuild_instance() method in the conductor service. That said, when transforming, we were forgetting about the 'requested_destination' field in the object so that when we were calling the scheduler, we were never using that field.\n\nThat bug was fixed implicitly by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/469037/ which is now merged in master, but the issue is still there in stable branches, and if you need to use the legacy methods, you'll not have it.\n\nAs a consequence, the feature to pass a destination for evacuation is not working in Newton and Ocata. Fortunately, given we didn't transformed the object into dicts before calling the scheduler for live-migrations, it does work for that action.\n\nA proper resolution would be to make sure that we pass the requested_destination field into 'filter_properties' so that when transforming again into an object, we set again the field.",
