Prior to this change,\n    the code would not all a PUT, POST or PATCH to not have a body. This was\n    added in I6e7dffb5dc5f0cdc78a57e8df3ae9952c55163ae which was fixing an\n    issue with how webob handles exceptions.\n    \n    This change does two things:\n    \n    * It address the problem from bug #1623517, fixed in the change id'd\n      above, in a more narrow fashion, making sure the data source that\n      causes the KeyError is non-empty right before it is used. This allows\n      simplifying the following change.\n    * If a request has a content-length (indicating the presence of a body),\n      verify that there is also a content-type. If not, raise a 400.\n    \n    basic-http.yaml has been change to modify one gabbi test to check a\n    response body is correct and to add another test to confirm that the\n    code that is doing the content-length check is passed through.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifb7446fd02ba3e54bbe2676dfd38e5dfecd15f98\n    Closes-Bug: #1674392\n    Related-Bug: #1623517\n",
