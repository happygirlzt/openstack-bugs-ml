    "description": "In Ocata, nova-compute wouldn't start if placement wasn't available, but it didn't check the version so placement from newton will still work with ocata computes. Also, the filter scheduler will fallback to not using placement if the computes aren't all new enough yet, but even once the computes are upgraded if placement is not the latest and microversion 1.4 isn't available, then the filter scheduler will not find any resource providers and it will result in a NoValidHost error.\n\nFor Pike, the fallback code for the older computes has been removed from the filter scheduler:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/436180/\n\nSo we're always calling placement from the filter scheduler. However, we don't enforce a minimum version of placement and we need 1.4 for the filter scheduler to work. We should add a check to the \"nova-status upgrade check\" command to enforce that placement is running with at least the 1.4 microversion (ocata) before upgrading to Pike.",
