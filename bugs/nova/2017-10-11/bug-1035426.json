Note that a tempdir will not work in production\n    but it is fine for testing. We set the lock_path to None in the\n    testing flags.\n    \n    Also removes the explicit cleanup in run_tests.sh. The new solution\n    works with tox and will work even if we add new locks.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1035426\n    \n    Change-Id: I613926e4288442e79df50ea5f5bd8f9eafdfe7e7\n",

Since two\n    greenthreads are used, the changes to utils.synchronized() can\n    cause a race where one thread is deleting the lock directory out\n    from under the other thread.\n    \n    An unrelated bug caused this race condition to be ignored since\n    the greenthreads were never waited on and as a result, the exceptions\n    never had a chance to be raised in the test case.\n    \n    Change-Id: I86b45414bbacd12bd3f5af323d26e0861c354ba8\n",
