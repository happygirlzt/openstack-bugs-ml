This check is only needed if we are going to\n    create a new network on the vswitch associated with the interface.\n    \n    This fix removes the check for the physical adapter and the vswitch\n    when network already exists.\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1226238\n    Change-Id: I1eecf2c339534d8694ec6a8bdfaff5217ba2f8ef\n",
