The iSCSI initiator name and FC HBA information is\n    obtained and saved in instance variables on the first call, and\n    these values are used in subsequent calls. However, if no\n    information is returned from any of these calls, this is not\n    saved, and the driver will try to get the information again in\n    every subsequent call. For a driver running on a system with no\n    iSCSI initiator configured, this means trying and failing to\n    read a file each time. For a system with no FC HBA, this\n    results in two calls to systool for each connect.\n    \n    This patch distinguishes between the case of the first call\n    and subsequent calls where the connection information was not\n    found. This speeds up connection times for systems that don't\n    have both iSCSI and FC configured. Note a behavioral change\n    that if iSCSI is not configured, or if the FC HBA is not present,\n    at the first connection, the service will have to be restarted\n    for the connection information to be used. I believe this is\n    a very uncommon scenario.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1406484\n    Change-Id: I233e4559baa0818353897e04c84501858a59febb\n",
