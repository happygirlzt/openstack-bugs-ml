The vm is technically active and could be restarted as it is available for customer interaction. \n\nIf the status of 'shutdown' or 'rebooting' or any other possible action on a vm is to be reflected in the state should it be another field in the api? The vm could be in ACTIVE status and shutdown. That seems reasonable. ",

            "content": "Sure. The issue I have here is where a catastrophic failure of happened and the node still shows up as being 'Active'.\n\nIn my case:\n\n -No VM was created\n -I have a stack trace in nova-compute explaining why\n -The openstack API shows a status of 'ACTIVE'.\n\nIn this case I would actually expect to see a state of 'ERROR' in the status log but I don't. Looking at the code there are a couple things going on here that seem problematic. On a catestrophic failure we seem to set the state to 'SHUTDOWN' instead of 'ERROR'. Additionally even if we did set the state to 'ERROR' in the virt layer there is a function in the compute manager called _poll_instance_states which will change the DB status of 'ERROR' to 'SHUTOFF' if the instance doesn't match what is in the DB. All of this leaves you with a node which marked as 'ACTIVE' in the OS API which implies the node is in a usable state.",

I don't necessary think the user should be bombarded with a bunch of power states but I do think what it says needs to be meaningful. Or like Paul said, lets show both the billing status and power state.",
