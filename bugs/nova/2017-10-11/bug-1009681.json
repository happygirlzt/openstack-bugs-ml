    "description": "We are building an Openstack Compute extension that has its own high level manager process, similar to nova-compute or nova-volume: https://github.com/gridcentric/openstack. \n\nWe want to use the common nova-scheduler to schedule requests to our manager but unfortunately the multi scheduler is hard-codeded for only compute and volume. Basically we want to have a default fall-through option so that our extension, and potentially other ones, can make use the multi scheduler. In other words, if the scheduling request is not destined for the compute or volume topic, then it will use this default driver (e.g. ChangeScheduler) to handle the request. \n\nAttached is a simple patch that defines a new config option \"default_scheduler_driver\" that defaults to the ChanceScheduler. This driver is then used for non-compute/non-volume topics.",
