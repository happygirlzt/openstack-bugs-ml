    "description": "PortLimit thrown when specifying used fixed ip\n\nThe nova/network/neutronv2/api.py _create_port will catch errors thrown from the neutron client.  The code asserts that a 409 error is an over-quota error.  However, this will hide other errors that may be occurring within the system.\n\nThe code is currently taking a calculated risk by assuming that all 409 errors that come through this code path will be over quota's. However, another high traffic code path is specifying a fixed_ip.  If a user specifies a fixed ip address, this code will now incorrectly throw a PortLimitExceeded error.  This leads the users to believe that they have run out of their quota limit.\n\nExample exception (then wrapped exception):\n\nNV-6FC38FD Neutron error creating port on network 7d360984-e12c-4bb3-819d-4b93c4ca4269\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py\", line 182, in _create_port\n    port_id = port_client.create_port(port_req_body)['port']['id']\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 108, in with_params\n    ret = self.function(instance, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 308, in create_port\n    return self.post(self.ports_path, body=body)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 1188, in post\n    headers=headers, params=params)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 1111, in do_request\n    self._handle_fault_response(status_code, replybody)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 1081, in _handle_fault_response\n    exception_handler_v20(status_code, des_error_body)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/neutronclient/v2_0/client.py\", line 93, in exception_handler_v20\n    message=msg)\nNeutronClientException: 409-{u'NeutronError': {u'message': u'Unable to complete operation for network 7d360984-e12c-4bb3-819d-4b93c4ca4269.

The client needs to provide a more granular exception so\n    nova can translate the error to it's own set of exceptions.\n    \n    Also adds a test case for the exception_handler_v20 utility method which\n    was lacking explicit test coverage before this change.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1247844\n    \n    Change-Id: I71589097ae660c3385b3f4ff93ffae99ac7042b9\n",
