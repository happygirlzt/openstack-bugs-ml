(Create new table with correct type of deleted) and copy data from old table to new.. and then drop old table and rename new to old name.\n\nUnfortunately there is probably one more bug in sqlalchemy, for some reason there is no uC in table's constraints.\nSo we lost all UC in sqlite that ware used.\n\nThere is only one table with such problem virtual_interfaces.address (Currently I am working on tests)\n\nTo fix this bug I should add one more db.migration.\n\nI think that this is not so important and could wait for Havana. How do you think?\n\nBy the way, I think that we should remove UC on address and make it on\n(address, deleted). Then we will be able to use soft_delete instead of delete. So probably it is better to fix it in Havana-1.",
