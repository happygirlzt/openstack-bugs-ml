As an example try to add below security group rule:\n\nnova --debug secgroup-add-rule default icmp -1 255 0.0.0.0/0\n\nAttempt fails and Neutron raises BadRequest. But neutron driver doesn't process exception with code 400 and reraises it again as NeutronClientException[1]. So this Exception is only handled [2], where code of this exceprion isn't processed correctly (because Neutron and Nova have different names for attribute with exceprion code), so nova throws internal server error instead of BadRequest:\n\nERROR (ClientException): The server has either erred or is incapable of performing the requested operation.
