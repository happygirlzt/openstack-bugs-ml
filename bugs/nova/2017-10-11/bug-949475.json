    "description": "A race condition exists in the creation of snapshots since we check the task_state in compute/api but don't set the task_state until compute/manager receives the message.\n\nThis can allow two (or more) snapshots to be created at virtually the same time, which, in the case of XenServer may end up causing VHDs to not coalesce properly.\n\nEven worse, when the VHD doesn't coalesce, this can cause the creation of \"bad\" images which ultimately corrupt the SR on the machine which they are restored to. This can have a cascading effect across the cluster where one bad image corrupts multiple machines.\n\nThe two pronged solution is to prevent \"bad\" images from getting created in the first place, and, 2), if we detect a bad image, bail on it before corrupting the SR.",
