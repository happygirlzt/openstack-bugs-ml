This patch fixes the problem by moving this part of code before\n    undefining the domain.\n    \n    Also 5fa74bc0b2 moves that part of code inside the method\n    _detach_encrypted_volumes which has nothing to do here.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie187748deff7b0143d1ca26e767c6665746094c5\n    Closes-Bug: #1366832\n",
