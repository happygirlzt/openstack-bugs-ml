It should really be\n    treated in the same way as MigrationPreCheckError.\n    \n    Along with fixing this bug, I have ensured the expected exceptions in\n    migrate_server are in sync with the except clause in _live_migrate.\n    \n    This goes through to the API, ensuring the errors are not treated as\n    internal server errors, but are given a slightly more appropriate error\n    return value.\n    \n    Currently the API returns 400 for all these kinds of errors. While other\n    error codes may be more appropriate, this change is concentrating purely\n    on ensuring we treat all the exceptions in the same way.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iafe5026ef5a095d76e9864b489571e7bcfeb55f0\n    Closes-Bug: #1312132\n",
