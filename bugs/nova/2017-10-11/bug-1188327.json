    "description": "The EC2 API RunInstances call supports the inclusion of a ClientToken.  The ClientToken consists of 64 ASCII characters or less. The first RunInstances call with a given ClientToken launches an instance, but future RunInstances calls with the same token have no effect. Client tokens are valid for at least 24 hours.\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-RunInstances.html\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Run_Instance_Idempotency.html\n\nI guess the way to tackle this is to add some persistent data into the CloudController class, maybe just a dict of client tokens and \"earliest expiration times\", and provide some method for periodically purging them?",
