    "description": "Using Nova-Network with use_ipv6 = True creates a problem. If an instance is spawned on a compute-node the br100 is created and the IPv4 routes are moved from the physical interface to the bridge. This does not seem to happen with the IPv6 routes.\n\nI end up with two routes for the same destination. One via the physical device and one via br100. This breaks the functionality until I delete the route that directs to the physical interface. As far as I can see in the linux_net.py#L1553 (stable/Icehouse) the \"ip -6 route del\" should be run along with ensure_bridge there.\n\nAlso the interface should not accept RAs in the future since this would set the default route again.",
