At 2.1 it's a list of dicts with a single 'id' key which is the volume id. After 2.3 the list of dicts can also contain the 'delete_on_termination' key.\n\nWe don't describe the actual contents of that dict in the list, i.e. the id and delete_on_termination keys.\n\nWe need to add os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached.id and os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached.delete_on_termination keys to the server details reference and note that delete_on_termination is only shown with microversion >= 2.3.",

The contents of the os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached list are\n       described, which are the id and delete_on_termination keys, the latter\n       being introduced in the GET /servers response in 2.3.\n    \n    2. The os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached parameters are removed from\n       the PUT /servers and POST /servers responses, since we don't actually\n       include those in the response for create and update operations, only\n       GET /servers/{server_id} and GET /servers/detail operations.\n       Note: create server is fixed in a follow up patch.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic92055e3095d220a3a11e35628f04e9e67c6b71a\n    Closes-Bug: #1675559\n",
