    "description": "There's a race condition between the shutdown and the destroy which results in the rescue VM sometimes not being destroyed.\n\nThis is caused by the use of an asynchronous shutdown but without waiting for it to finish.\n\nSince the rescue VM is not destroyed any subsequent attempts to rescue an instance will fail.\n\nAlso, the destroy is done asynchronously without any wait so any failures will be silently dropped.",
