This\n    becomes a problem when a network reset is called for instances\n    using the agent communication mechanism. In that case the\n    agent will incorrectly rename the host. Thus the\n    hostname needs to be set prior and cleared after a network reset.\n    \n    The setting of the metadata params also need to be atomic so\n    locking was added that matches to the locking provided by\n    other data (network metadata).\n    \n    Fixes bug 1236877\n    \n    Change-Id: I473870994c826f85a7c6ec1448171c4e4ee40ff0\n",
