This patch\n    ensures that the unicode is coerced to ascii so the comparison\n    is correct.\n    \n    Change-Id: I72b322e7513f7da32e8dc75c6bf0e7e016948c88\n\ncommit 4286f36a60446e322f23a329416be3ed67db1149\nAuthor: anc <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Mar 10 11:46:58 2014 +0000\n\n    Enable object system metadata on PUTs\n    \n    This patch takes a first step towards support\n    for object system metadata by enabling headers\n    in the x-object-sysmeta- namespace to be\n    persisted when objects are PUT. This should be\n    useful for other pending patches such as on\n    demand migration and server side encryption\n    (https://review.openstack.org/#/c/64430/ and\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/76578/1).\n    \n    The x-object-sysmeta- namespace is already\n    reserved/protected by the gatekeeper and\n    passed through the proxy. This patch modifies\n    the object server to persist these headers\n    alongside user metadata when an object is\n    PUT.\n    \n    This patch will preserve existing object\n    system metadata and ignore any new system\n    metadata when handling object POSTs,\n    including POST-as-copy operations. Support\n    for modification of object system metadata\n    with a POST request requires further work\n    as discussed in the blueprint.\n    \n    This patch will preserve existing object\n    system metadata and update it with new\n    system metadata when copying an object.\n    \n    A new probe test is added which makes use of\n    the BrainSplitter class that has been moved\n    from test_container_merge_policy_index.py to\n    a new module brain.py.\n    \n    blueprint object-system-metadata\n    \n    Change-Id: If716bc15730b7322266ebff4ab8dd31e78e4b962\n\ncommit 8ad37b2217c30b756bb79ead84be7c04f628ed36\nAuthor: Christian Schwede <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Aug 1 13:55:21 2014 +0000\n\n    Fix swift-dispersion-populate bug when using SimpleClient class\n    \n    Commit 7fcbbebb changed the internal client a little bit and removed the\n    class variable self.attempts in SimpleClient. This is currently still\n    needed in swift-dispersion-populate to track the number of retries, thus\n    re-adding it again.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1351323\n    Change-Id: I98ba6441607158b34708b2dbb2d1a63788681d63\n\ncommit 5a84b1cde102dac4ae5a40a20a364ada1dc547e9\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jul 31 12:18:47 2014 -0700\n\n    Put proxy-logging in object expirer's sample config\n    \n    It's generally better to have logs for something than to not have\n    logs. This way, the object expirer (if using the sample config as a\n    starting point) will log what it does.\n    \n    Note that the container reconciler's sample config already contains\n    proxy-logging, as does the proxy server's. The object expirer is the\n    odd man out.\n    \n    Change-Id: I32aac99131746501820319b94405440c1934a694\n\ncommit 4bc600ff42f254849458c77ddef9bdc47f91e4a1\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 25 18:50:19 2014 -0700\n\n    Fix \"Handoff requested (N)\" log spam\n    \n    A long, long time ago, on a GET request, the proxy would go look on 3*\n    nodes for the requested thing. If one of the primary nodes was\n    error-limited, it'd look on two primaries and a handoff. Since this\n    indicated some failure somewhere, the proxy would emit a warning:\n    \"Handoff requested (1)\". If two primaries were down, there'd be a\n    second message \"Handoff requested (2)\", and so on.\n    \n    Some StatsD messages were emitted too.\n    \n    A somewhat shorter time ago (commit d79a67eb), the proxy started\n    looking into handoffs if it got 404s from the primaries. While this\n    was a good idea, it resulted lots of \"Handoff requested (N)\" log spam;\n    you'd see these messages on every single 404. Also, the StatsD\n    handoff_count and handoff_all_count metrics shot way up and turned\n    into noise.\n    \n    This commit restores the original intent (and usefulness) of the log\n    messages and StatsD metrics: if the proxy only looks at the normal\n    number of handoff nodes, nothing is logged. However, if a primary is\n    down, then the message \"Handoff requested (1)\" will be logged,\n    indicating that the proxy looked at one more handoff than it normally\n    would, and this happened because a primary node was error-limited.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1297214\n    \n    * or whatever the replica count was\n    \n    Change-Id: If1b77c18c880b096e8ab1df3008db40ce313835d\n\ncommit 1cd14daadb40f5d76e559d874e106e9b63612689\nAuthor: paul luse <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 25 16:34:39 2014 -0700\n\n    Reuse a cursor instead of a conn.execute for better performance\n    \n    Basically the same thing as https://review.openstack.org/#/c/109694/\n    but over in the account backend.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9255f3145818da3adafc16d3bcf159608a78fe51\n\ncommit 670dc920deaf64a99f6ca3ad10ba19029493f3ff\nAuthor: David Goetz <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 25 12:16:54 2014 -0700\n\n    Reuse a cursor instead of a conn.execute for better performance\n    \n    In some limited testing it was ~10% faster.
