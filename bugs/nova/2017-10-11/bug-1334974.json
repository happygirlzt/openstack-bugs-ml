This make the usage difficult in modules which\n    do not need to call ComputeAPI by other reason.\n    \n    Besides this function does not use any of the class members. So there is\n    no reason for it to be the class method.\n    \n    This patch moves this function to compute.utils because it does not use\n    anything of the class members.\n    \n    This patch also adds support for the _get_root_bdm and\n    is_volume_backed_instance to read from a dictionary instead of an\n    Instance object. Because of this we can call is_volume_backed_instance\n    from build_request_spec and fix bug #1469179.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6d446088faf500ed39a4504794d09d0f86e2bbc3\n    Co-Authored-By: Feodor Tersin <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Ankit Agrawal <email address hidden>\n    Related-Bug: #1469179\n    Related-Bug: #1334974\n    Related-Bug: #1358566\n",
