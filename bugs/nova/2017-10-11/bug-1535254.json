And I found a problem with 'notify_on_state_change'.\n\nIn the configuration doc, 'notify_on_state_change' means that \"If set, send compute.instance.update notifications on instance state changes.\" Valid values are None, 'vm_state' and 'vm_and_task_state'. However, in current implementation,  if it's set to 'vm_state', compute.instance.update notifications will be sent for all the state changes and it will be a special state change notification when the vm state changes. So as to 'vm_and_task_state'.",

I think we'd better introduce another valid value 'all_state' to get all the compute.instance.update notifications. And if 'vm_and_task_state' is set, we only send update notifications when vm state or task state have been changed.  The same with 'vm_state'.",
