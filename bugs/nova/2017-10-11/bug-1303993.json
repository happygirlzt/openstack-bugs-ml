We have this data and would like to get\nit upstream.  \nSpecific issues covered:\n- Increase the amount of disk queued bytes by double to improve downloading (we can queue more and not stall downloads)\n- Allow download/uploads to run non-uniform since we are not a DSL Line.\n- Also the plugin logs ever second and that is somewhat excessive.  Would like to log only every 10 seconds.",

The settings are documented here:\n    http://www.rasterbar.com/products/libtorrent/reference-Settings.html\n    \n    I'm proposing to add these with dom0 environment overrides in case\n    any other adjustments are needed.  The changes effectively double the\n    download rate from the default settings.  It also allows unbalanced\n    download/upload which is preferred in openstack environments.\n    \n    No unit tests were added as plugins are not currently unit tested.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1303993\n    \n    Change-Id: I503a6a521c196e4ad58e0a16aba2988f66a9cdca\n",
