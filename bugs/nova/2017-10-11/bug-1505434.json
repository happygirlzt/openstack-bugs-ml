    "description": "HypervisorsController._view_hypervisor only sets hypervisor['servers'] when servers passed in is non empty list (if servers:). Instead it should check to see if servers is not passed in (if servers is not None:).\n\nThe reason why this is useful is that currently novaclient would return a Resource object with no servers attribute set, because it only deserializes what the API returns. Therefore, when using the novaclient to get hypervisor servers, it requires an additional hasattr(hypervisor, 'servers') check.\n\nThis is a pretty standard convention for any API that is expected to return a list to return an empty list to indicate that there is no item.\n\nGit version: 02b7e64b29dd707c637ea7026d337e5cb196f337v\nReproduce steps:\n1. Have a hypervisor with no instances on it.\n2. Call any API that is expected to return hypervisor object that also return the instances in it.\n2.1. This API should indirectly call HypervisorsController._view_hypervisor and pass the servers argument. i.e. HypervisorsController.servers\n3. Notice that for hypervisor with instances, the hypervisor object has a list of servers set. While the hypervisor that does not have any instances, it would not have the servers attribute set at all.",
