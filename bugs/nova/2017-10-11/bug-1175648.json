The dynamic volume-attach reserves the volume by changing the state from 'available' to 'attaching'. This needs to be done for boot time attachments as well. But care should be taken to rollback the state of the volume if the booting aborts.\n\nSteps to recreate:\n\n1. Boot an instance VM1 with block-device-mapping a volume V1.\n2. Around the same time volume-attach V1 to another instance VM2.\n\nIt is likely that the volume V1 gets attached to VM2 and VM1 to ends up in ERROR.",
