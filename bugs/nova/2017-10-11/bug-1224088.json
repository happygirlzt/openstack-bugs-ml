Most Nova instance operations emit\n    compute.instance.<operation>.start/end notifications, which external systems\n    can use to track changes in the state on an instance (e.g. for billing\n    purposes). Rescues change launched_at for the instance, which can prevent an\n    external system from having a consistant picture of the instances' running,\n    unless they take that into account.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3d7d334c88953ddf693c864c3e5e0746cdd2056c\n    Closes-bug: 1224088\n",
