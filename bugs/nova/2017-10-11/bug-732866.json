I was trying to communicate the idea that because the password is checked against every password in the system (not just the user's password), as the number of users/passwords in the system increases, the ease with which we can discover passwords increases.\n\nI think we're all agreed it should be fixed!\n\nAnd maybe in the future we can persuade you & your colleague to have a look at the authentication code, when the 'real' authn system is implemented :-)",
