    "description": "Currently, when rebuilding an instance with volume attached, the Nova compute manager will directly call _detach_volume() which will skip the checks of volume status (volume_api.check_detach) and setting the volume to 'detaching' (volume_api.begin_detaching) at Cinder side. This is different with the normal volume detach process.\n\nBesides, when rebuilding, we should only allow detaching the volume with in-use status, volume in status such as 'retyping' should not allowed.",
