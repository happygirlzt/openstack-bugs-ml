            "content": "Yeah so I think the problem is what you described in the bug description. The instance is owned by the demo project, but when the admin shelves the instances, the resulting snapshot image is owned by the admin project. The shelve_image_id is stored on the instance, and when we go to unshelve we try to build the instance using that image, which is owned by the admin, so the demo user that is trying to unshelve does not have access to the snapshot image and we get the 404 from Glance, and we fail.\n\nA way to workaround this is for the admin to add image membership access to the demo user on the snapshot image, but that's not great.\n\nI'm not sure if this is intentional or not. I wanted to look at the snapshot flow to see which project ends up owning the snapshot, the context performing the snapshot or the owner of the instance. The snapshot case matters less because the instance owner doesn't necessarily need access to the snapshot image if the admin created the snapshot, but for unshelve the instance owner does actually need access to the snapshot image.",

            "content": "When Nova creates a snapshot image it passes is_public=False to the nova.image.glance client wrapper, which translates that to visibility=private in glance v2 parlance.  This is legacy behavior from when nova only worked with glance v1.\n\nLooking at the image v2 API, it looks like by default the visibility on an image is 'shared':\n\nhttps://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#images\n\nReading up on image sharing:\n\nhttps://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/index.html#sharing\n\nThat sounds like what we'd want to do here, is if the context.project_id != instance.project_id, then the owner of the image is the context.project_id (admin in this case), and we'd add a shared member to the image which would be the instance.project_id. That way on unshelve, the instance user (demo) has access to the image.\n\nWhat I'm not sure about is if we have to do anything else besides create the image member, because reading further the docs say:\n\n\"When an image is shared, the member is given immediate access to the image. In order to prevent spamming other users\u2019 image lists, a shared image does not appear in a member\u2019s image list until the member \u201caccepts\u201d the image.\"\n\nSo does the demo user have to explicitly accept the image membership to be able to GET it?\n\nI think this answers that question though:\n\nhttp://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/api/v2/sharing-image-api-v2.html#one-one-sharing\n\n\"Let the \u201cproducer\u201d be the owner of image 71c675ab-d94f-49cd-a114-e12490b328d9, and let the \u201cconsumer\u201d be a user who would like to boot an instance from that image.\n\nThe producer can share the image with the consumer by making the consumer a member of that image.\n\nTo prevent spamming, the consumer must accept the image before it will be included in the consumer\u2019s image list.\n\nThe consumer can still boot from the image, however, if the consumer knows the image ID.\"\n\nIn this case, the consumer (demo user) knows the image ID, it's in the instance system_metadata via the shelved_image_id key used in conductor when unshelving the instance:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/conductor/manager.py#L656\n\nSo I think that's the answer to this bug. When we shelve, if the user doing the shelving and owning the snapshot is not the owner of the instance, then we need to add the owner of the instance to have shared membership with the image so they can unshelve it.",
