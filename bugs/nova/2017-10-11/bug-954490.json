Or do you mean that it is not useful?\nWe are using pure Diablo/stable in one of our environments and it is completely functional.\n\nAs I explained in my ML reply, we were planning to contribute all latest updates closer to Folsom.\nBut if at least this basic code will be removed it will be twice harder to perform a merge (especially if DBs will be removed).\n\nI would vote for option A (for sure :-)).\n\nPlease let us know what should be done from our side in order to leave code as is.\n\n\n",
