This is always an empty string when the protocol is http or https.\n\nThe noVNC project addressed this issue in the following patches.\n\nhttps://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/pull/245\nhttps://github.com/kanaka/noVNC/pull/252\n\nWould like to request a newer nova-novnc be built, or patch the existing package with the PR above, and backport to grizzly's UEC ppas.",
