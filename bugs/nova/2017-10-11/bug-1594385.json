    "description": "When verifying Glance image signatures, Nova does not report a meaningful error message to the end user. Instead, Nova gives the end user a \"No hosts available\" message.\n\nHow to verify this behavior:\n- Enable Nova's verify_glance_signatures configuration flag\n- Upload an image to Glance with incorrect or missing signature metadata\n- Attempt to boot an instance of this image via the Nova CLI\n\nYou should get an error message with the text \"No valid host was found. There are not enough hosts available\". This does not describe the failure and will lead the end user to think there is an issue with the storage on the compute node.",
