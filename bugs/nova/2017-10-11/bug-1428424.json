This patch removes all its occurences by using the helper\n    script at [1].\n    \n    This is a necessary step to allow us running all unit tests with\n    Python 3 (not just a small subset as it is done now).\n    \n    [1]: https://github.com/adrienverge/context_unnester\n    \n    Change-Id: I8d1de09ff38ed0af9fb56f423a2c43476408e0fb\n    Blueprint: neutron-python3\n    Closes-Bug: #1428424\n",
