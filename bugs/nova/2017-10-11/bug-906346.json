The ping being\n    sent was 15 bytes long when it should have been 14.  Removing a pad byte\n    from the format string resolves this issue.  I verified that the format\n    described in the code comments (and now the code) was correct using an\n    OpenVPN connection setup packet capture.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idbc5e48ede4a8d2836dd1b102a9a0e172540776c\n",
