I believe we need to revisit this again to see why it isn't working in all cases (maverick, libvirt, flatdhcp).",

Nova used to ensure this by removing and readding the other interface if it exists.  Not sure why this is no longer happening.  But as long as 10.0.0.1 (for example) is first, it works without bind-interface\n\nNeed to find out why it is not getting moved properly.  I will look for a fix.",
