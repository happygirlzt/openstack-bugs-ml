It contain the response sample of list keypair API. \nBelow API sample files, from their name it looks like these are for get keypair API. But in actual content of these files are written as List keypair API response. So it create the confusion that for which API these API sample file are.

This issue is in  both V2 and V3 APIs sample.\n\nSolution-\n - Here we need to rename the above sample files and their test from 'keypairs-get-resp.json.tpl' to 'keypairs-list-resp.json.tpl' etc\n - Create the new sample file and test for GET keypair.",
