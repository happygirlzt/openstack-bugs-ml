This logic is current in api/nova/ and not in api/ec2.\n\nI expected the ec2 api to have the same behavior. We currently lost user data because of this.\n\nWould be nice to have compute/api.y only a contain a single delete function which does the checking whether to soft-delete or not instead of doing it in the api level.\n\nImpact: High",
