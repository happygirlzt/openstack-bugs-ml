There is a setting in the config file (nova.conf) \"novncproxy_base_url\" that contains the full url of the vnc proxy and if it's not changed manually to https, then horizon displays a server not found error. If it is manually updated to https then it works as expected.\nI don't know if it's expected for the user to change the novncproxy_base_url by hand, but it would be convenient if it changes automatically to https when ssl/tls is configured.",
