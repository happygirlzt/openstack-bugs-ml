Call hyper visor show API for any hypervisor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, check the value of disk_available_least.\n2. Create a instance with qcow2 image on 1's hypervisor.\n3. Wait for over 1 minute.\n4. Call hyper visor show API.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, check that disk_available_least is smaller than step 1's value.\n5. Call Stop Server API for the instance.\n6.
