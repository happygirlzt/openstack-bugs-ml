This is because the encryptor requests cryptsetup\n    to create the symlink to the LUKS device with the same name of\n    the device-mapper multipath device. To avoid the name collision,\n    this patch adds the 'crypt-' prefix to the symlink.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia001204df9b14f635ab998590e8add119c1aec23\n    Closes-Bug: #1439869\n\ncommit 05827810ca931dafafd19fa4e95143fbede1a3dc\nAuthor: LisaLi <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Nov 19 08:55:36 2015 +0000\n\n    Copy encryptors from Nova to os-brick\n    \n    Currently, when creating an encrypted volume from an image, Cinder\n    writes raw data to the encrypted volume. When Cinder uploads an\n    encrypted volume to an image, it writes encrypted data to the image.\n    As a result, Nova cannot use these images or volumes.\n    To fix above problem, cinder needs to add encryptor attach/detach\n    layers.\n    As both Nova and Cinder needs to use the module, the fix is to\n    move it to os-brick.\n    It copies encryptors from Nova to os-brick, and keep all interfaces\n    unchanged except initialization.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8044183ad02110c8b2468e20327d822c0437c772\n    Implements: blueprint improve-encrypted-volume\n    Related-bug: #1482464\n    Related-bug: #1465656",
