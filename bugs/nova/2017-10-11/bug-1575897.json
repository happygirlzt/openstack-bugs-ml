    "description": "The config drive currently is only generated on initial boot. As a result of this if you have an instance that is a BFV instance and the hypervisor hosting the instance goes down you cannot issue an evacuate command on the instance because compute on the new destination will not re-generate the config drive but it will generate XML for libvirt that references the disk.config file. As a result the instance will go into an error state on the new destination.\n\nThe config drive is not regenerated because the config drive can store the admin password as passed at boot. Since admin password is not persisted to the DB for security reason it can't be rebuilt.\n\nThe best way to address this to to simply regenerate the config drive without the admin password. We should update the logic around evacuate to regenerate the config drive without the password so that the instance is at least still bootable.",
