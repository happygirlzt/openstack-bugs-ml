This is pretty tricky in general, because with latest libvirt & qemu, qemu doesn't even get acess to the log files.  It just gets given an anonymous pipe file descriptor, so it has no ability to migrate the log file even if it wanted to.\n\nlibvirt tries to only concern itself with what happens on a single-node \nso moving stuff between nodes is left to the app using libvirt which knows better what to do\".\n-------\n\nAnd, Pawel just agreed on #openstack-nova that it \"sounds fair that higher-layer should handle this, yes\".",
