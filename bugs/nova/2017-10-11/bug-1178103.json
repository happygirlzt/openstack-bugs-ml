    "description": "For two reasons : a) until we have quantum-pxe done, it won't work, and b) file injection always happens.\n\nOne of the reasons to want to disable file injection is to work with hardware that gets a ethernet interface other than 'eth0' - e.g. if only eth1 is plugged in on the hardware, file injection with it's hardcoded parameters interferes with network bringup.\n\nA workaround for homogeneous environments is to change the template to hardcode the interface name (s/iface.name/eth2/)",
