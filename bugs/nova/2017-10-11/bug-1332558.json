Go to Project --> Compute --> Images and click on 'Create Image'.\n2. Create an image with 'Raw' format.\n3. Go to Project --> Compute --> Instances and click on 'Launch Instance'.\n4. Boot an instance by selecting the 'Boot from image' as source and newly created raw image from the Image Name drop-down.\n5. Click on 'Create Snapshot' to create a snapshot of this instance.\n6. You will be redirected to image list page where you will see the format of snapshot as 'QCOW2'.\n\nIdeally the snapshot format should be same as its source image.",
