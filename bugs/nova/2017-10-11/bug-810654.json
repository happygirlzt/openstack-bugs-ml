State=8, so setting state to shutoff.\n\nThe state of whether or not the instance is running should be independent of the status of the build of the VM.  If the VM goes to error state, it should report back that the instance is now in error state.  Changing the state to ShutOff because the instance isn't built yet does not properly reflect the state of the VM.  I've also noticed that long running builds will sometimes be set to shut off from build and then they later go active.\n\nRunning rev 1271.",

I started a list on the wiki here: \n\nhttp://wiki.openstack.org/status_transition_issues\n\nMy conclusion was that the status columns are a bit overloaded and got the feeling we might actually benefit from a blueprint or something to address some of the status tracking issues across the board. As they seem to be rather widespread I wasn't sure filing tickets on each issue was the way to go about fixing these...",
