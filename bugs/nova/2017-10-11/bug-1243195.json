    "description": "The flavor-create API does validation that root_gb and other integer values are positive integers but it doesn't do an upper bounds check to make sure they aren't longs.  If a user tries to create a flavor with an integer value that is bigger than an int, the python int() method (used in the validation) will just convert it to a long but the database model for InstanceTypes defines the column as an Integer (not a BigInteger) and then the database has to handle the value.\n\nSome examples:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/48988/\n\nThe nova.compute.flavor.create() method should validate that the integer values are actually integers and not longs (I'd suggest checking to make sure the int values are <= sys.maxint).\n\nFrom the DB model, it looks like these are the fields that need the validation:\n\n    memory_mb = Column(Integer, nullable=False)\n    vcpus = Column(Integer, nullable=False)\n    root_gb = Column(Integer)\n    ephemeral_gb = Column(Integer)\n    swap = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=0)\n    vcpu_weight = Column(Integer)",
