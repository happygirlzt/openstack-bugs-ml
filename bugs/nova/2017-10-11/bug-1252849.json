Unable to delete those servers using nova delete.\n\nTempest and compute traceback here:\n  http://pastebin.com/CVjG03eV\n\nThe patch was to disable cache refresh in allocate_for_instance, allocate_port_for_instance and deallocate_port_for_instance methods. This is breaking the nova boot process when the servers are created using the above tempest test. However, we could create servers using nova boot api, manually. It is likely because the cache is disabled while allocating the instance.\n\nThe servers created using above test is left in ERROR state and we are unable to delete them. It is likely because the cache is disabled while deallocating the instance and/or port.\n\nNOTE:\nIf we restore the @refresh_sync decorator against those methods and do not use the decorate in _get_instance_nw_info, the  the above tempest test is successful. I have not tested it when deleting the VM.",
