As CoreFilter is not enabled the\n    filtering result in hosts selected without enough VCPU resource.\n    \n    This is a test for an open bug therefore it asserts the wrong behavior\n    but it has the proper assert commented out.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1708637\n    Change-Id: Ibd7f695d51b1f8497ca492968c7e5c69ada0a85c\n",
