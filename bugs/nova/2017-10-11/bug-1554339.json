And, AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter also use extra_specs to create new instance in a host aggregate. The problem is they failed to select any destinations, when the key is in non-scope format. As is shown in, https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/scheduler/filters/compute_capabilities_filter.py#L77.\n\nFor example, we may want to use host aggregate to create a new instance in some servers with specified properties. So we create a new flavor and set 'extra_specs' to {\"property\": \"balabala\"}\uff0cthe computecapabilitiesfilter will return false.  In this situation, ComputeCapabilitiesFilter failed to work with AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter\n\nI think we'd better check the capabilities only when the key for the filter is scope format in capabilities scope (i.e. capabilities:xxx:yyy), rather than non-scope format (i.e. no : contained).",
