    "description": "When lazy message translation is enabled in Nova, the check_update.sh calls generate_sample.sh, which uses a copy of oslo's config/generator.py which produces the following message: \n\nCRITICAL nova [-] TypeError: Message objects do not support addition.\n\nThe config/generator.py module installs i18n without lazy enabled (named parameter 'lazy' not specified): \n\ngettextutils.install('nova') \n\nTo gather information about the projects options, it loads the project modules looking for entry points.   When these modules are loaded, they may contain code to enable lazy.   In the case of Nova this is the nova/cmds/__init__.py which calls: \n\ngettextutils.enable_lazy()\n\nThis means that the messages returned with information for the entry points are lazy enabled.  Thus when config/generator.py tries to work with the help message for the option associated with the Nova modules: \n\nopt_help += ' (' + OPT_TYPES[opt_type] + ')'\n\nit fails because opt_help is a gettextutils.Message instance, which doesn't support addition.",
