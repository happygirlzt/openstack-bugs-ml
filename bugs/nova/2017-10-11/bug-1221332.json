    "description": "There are a few small performance issues that can easily be fixed.\n\nFirst a regression:\n* on resize down we now call resize2fs twice, once to get the minimum file system size. There is no need to call it twice, just handle the error case correctly\n\nThe other issue:\n* resize_disk uses copy, we could consider using clone (or snapshot) to save time, assuming that does not slow down the other steps\n* consider using zerofree to help reduce the filesystem size further, after shrinking the filesystem, before the sparse copy\n* while the above will take time, it should reduce the amount of data copied over the network",
