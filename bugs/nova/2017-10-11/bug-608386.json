    "description": "Doing some cleanup in the objectstore_unittest.py file, I noticed that the test case was papering over the actual exception type by just checking for the existence of an exception.  For instance:\n\n        # deleting non-empty bucket throws exception\n        exception = False\n        try:\n            bucket.delete()\n        except:\n            exception = True\n\n        self.assert_(exception)\n\nThis helps the test case pass, but unfortunately covers up some bad behaviour, like the fact that bucket.delete() actually throws a misleading NotAuthorized exception instead of, for example, a NotEmpty exception...\n\nFix for this bug is to clean up the test case to properly use self.assertRaises() and to modify Bucket.delete() to throw a NotEmpty exception.",
