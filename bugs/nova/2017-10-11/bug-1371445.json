    "description": "In EC2 classic mode AWS automatically associates a public IP address to an instance being launched. See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#differences\n\nSince Nova EC2 emulates EC2 classic mode of AWS (there is no VPC support in Nova EC2), it should associate a floating IP as well. But it doesn't do this.\n\nThough Nova has auto_assign_floating_ip parameter which does work similar AWS. But it isn't implemented for Neutron networks. And it affects both methods of running: EC2 and native Nova. Thus if we want a cloud to be AWS compatible, and we use this parameter, we change behavior of Nova in it's native part. This may be not desirable.",
