It did not ensure there was\n    no working database around when it wasn't being used, so tests which\n    leaked into the database might pass even if they were listed as a\n    NoDBTest, because there was an in memory test db from a prior run.\n    \n    This adds a cleanup path to the fixture which blows away the db at the\n    end of the test (which itself is tested). There were 46 tests which\n    failed when we got this isolation correct, and this changes all those\n    test classes containing those tests to require a db. Many of these\n    could have narrower fixes, but this returns us to an isolated state.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id0480035d8e615ae602da9737cd2c94bc7967067\n    Closes-Bug: #1431519\n    Closes-Bug: #1431551\n",
