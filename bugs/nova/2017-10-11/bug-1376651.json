Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Oct 2 10:44:35 2014 +0100\n\n    libvirt: abort init_host method on libvirt that is too old\n    \n    Nova has a declared minimum supported libvirt and the init_host\n    method will log an error message if it sees an older version is\n    installed. Unfortunately people are frequently not seeing this\n    error message and then filing bugs about things that are broken\n    on older libvirt versions.\n    \n    Turn the log message into an exception so that nova-compute\n    process startup is completely aborted so people will see the\n    problem immediately rather than some unpredictable time later.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1376651\n    Change-Id: I87d5a41145b05cc2be3559ab528497fe8355ba85\n",
