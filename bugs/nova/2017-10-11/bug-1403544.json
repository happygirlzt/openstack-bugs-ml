Froloff <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Dec 18 15:19:05 2014 +0300\n\n    Do not treat empty key_name as None\n    \n    When running instance, empty (\"\") key_name is treated as None and\n    keypair lookup does not happen.  However, empty string is written to\n    key_name field in instance's database record.  When horizon renders\n    instance info, it looks up keypair if key_name is not None.  Having\n    empty string in this property generates error and instance info is not\n    displayed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib67b124e6480f3435d31c983f1bfca769899c8e7\n    Closes-Bug: #1403544\n",
