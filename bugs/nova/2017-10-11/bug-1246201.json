I\n    don't think this makes sense for LVM, where we would be creating\n    a LV for a tens of megabytes file, which seems like overkill to\n    me. The other storage backends use local disk for their data\n    already.\n    \n    This use case was covered by the now reverted changes:\n      228d0221763b12f11ecbacde4db38b1151f96e31\n      0b01e846d40f3b343da9ebe1dae89cca8bc2ac66\n      ecce888c469c62374a3cc43e3cede11d8aa1e799\n    \n    Support this special case by moving the image to rbd once it has\n    been created in the local instance directory on the hypervisor.\n    \n    I've tested this change in devstack and it works.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1369627\n    Related-bug: #1361840\n    Related-bug: #1246201\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Mehdi Abaakouk <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Dan Smith <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia3ca5a18c79d62b71b9c042a612d12dd074b245e\n",
