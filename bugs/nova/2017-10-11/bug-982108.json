After the compute node came back, the user wasn't able to reboot the instance because:\n\n    @check_instance_state(vm_state=[vm_states.ACTIVE, vm_states.STOPPED,\n                                    vm_states.RESCUED],\n                          task_state=[None, task_states.REBOOTING])\n    def reboot(self, context, instance, reboot_type):\n\ni.e. reboot is allowed while in task_state=REBOOTING_HARD\n\nLooking at https://review.openstack.org/5090 and https://review.openstack.org/12368 I'm reading into Vish's comments that there can be problems if you do attempt hard reboot while a hard reboot is in progress\n\nISTM that if that's a concern, the compute manager should just take a lock on the instance while it's rebooting\n\n",
