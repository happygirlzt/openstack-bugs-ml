Nova need to translate those errors into appropriate HTTP error codes,\n    so that end user will be able to know the exact failure reason. Propose to\n    change the following mappings:\n    \n    PortNotFound - 400 --> 404\n    PortInUse  - 400 --> 409\n    NetworkNotFound - 400 --> 404\n    FixedIpAlreadyInUse - 400 --> 409\n    \n    In order to keep V2 api backward-compatibility, only propose to adjust the\n    error code of V2.1/V3 api.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icc80c1f847bb9c5737e7282ce8543be52cde8f89\n    Closes-Bug: 1380901\n",
