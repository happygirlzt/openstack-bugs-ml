    "description": "compute/api create() shoves 'config_drive_id' into instance properties... which get passed down during a build.. but that's not a column in the DB.\n\nIt looks like it actually makes it all the way into libvirt because we don't use the results from any instance_update() in between, which is bad because the instance we pass has old task_state, etc.\n\nAlso: This will not work when we switch to passing objects.\n\n---\n\nAdditionally it appears that all code related to supporting image ids with config drive was supposed to be removed anyway: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1029647",

This is a good indication that this functionality is not\n    used.  As far as I can tell, the docs also do not match what was\n    supported.  An image ID was required, but docs show examples with full\n    hrefs.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/api_ext/ext_config_drive.html\n    \n    References to supporting image_hrefs should be removed.\n    \n    This patch also removes the hack that passed a config_drive_id via\n    the Instance dictionary when config_drive_id is not a valid Column for\n    Instance.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1186401\n    \n    Change-Id: Iced7bc8e278cb9f208183f1dbb7a293675a47eae\n",
