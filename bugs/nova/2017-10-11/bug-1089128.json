    "description": "Currently developers need MySQL installed in order to develop locally (due to MySQL-Python being in the test-requires file).\n\nThis can result in the following error my_config missing error: \n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/27856/\n\n\nThe workaround for Mac is to install MySQL. If you use brew, `brew install mysql` will work.\n\nLong term, it would be nice to not require MySQL and instead make it optional. It looks like Monty started on this but later reverted this work with commit 6e9f3bb10a105411b0eb3e8f22a252af0784cb0b. \n\nThis bug is to track somehow fixing this, either by completing what Monty started, or finding some other approach.",
