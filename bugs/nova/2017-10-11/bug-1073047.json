I was able to get the full functionality at that time. I was able to upload images and create an instances, assign the floating IP's, etc.\n\n         After couple of days when I was trying to remove the instances then it was showing that instances was terminated but I can see that it was showing Active and trying to delete that instances. After a long time I went for reboot because it was not going anywhere. After reboot it was showing the same thing as earlier.\n\n        I saw the services of nova and found out that it was stating running but with \"XX\". Then I went to logs then found out that there was error was showing, you can see that in attachment.\n\n       After doing some search in OpenStack mailing list about this problem I found this link <https://answers.launchpad.net/horizon/+question/201069> \n\n       After reading above link I removed the nova compute database then recreated database then tried to sync then it was not given any error. After doing this I was not getting that earlier problem but after reboot I saw that mysql stopped working. After doing the \"service mysql start\" it shows \"start: Job failed to start\".\n\n       Please help me out of this. If anybody knows about this problem then reply.",
