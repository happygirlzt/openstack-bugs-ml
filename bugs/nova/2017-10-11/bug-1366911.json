Enough to just push the snapshotting of this instance over the 60 minute mark.\n3. Upon Image Upload (\"Uploading image data for image\" in the logs) Nova would then return a 401 Unauthorized error stating \"This server could not verify that you are authorized to access the document you requested. Either you supplied the wrong credentials (e.g., bad password), or your browser does not understand how to supply the credentials required.\"\n\nIcehouse 2014.1.2, KVM as the hypervisor.\n\nThe workaround is to specify a longer token timeout - however limits the ability to set short token expirations.\n\nA possible solution may be to get a new/refresh the token if the time has exceeded the timeout.",
