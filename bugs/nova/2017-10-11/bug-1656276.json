I think the reason for this is to avoid the possibility of creating orphaned cell mappings.\n\nThe command creates a cell0 mapping and single cell mapping, and maps any found hosts to the created cell.\n\nThe 'nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts' command maps unmapped hosts to an existing cell mapping. It requires compute nodes to be registered already.\n\nThe 'nova-manage cell_v2 map_cell_and_hosts' command creates a cell mapping and maps found hosts to the created cell. It requires compute nodes to be registered already.",

And then we'd change the map_cell_and_hosts command to return 1 if there are no compute nodes because that command is specifically for that part of the setup and can't be incomplete.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what that means for simple_cell_setup for it to be incomplete, because if that doesn't fail and people continue on, but forget (or don't know) to map the hosts to cells later, then they can't do anything. That might just be a communication/docs issue though.\n\nIf we compare simple_cell_setup to the 'nova-status upgrade check' command when it's checking cells v2, it doesn't fail if there are cell mappings but no compute nodes (no host mappings):\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/3ec43d81c324d8229bbb4b5db301175886a049b6/nova/cmd/status.py#L168\n\nIt prints a message, but doesn't consider it a failure. That's for the fresh install case that you've created the cell mappings but don't have any computes reporting in yet. I'm thinking we model that in simple_cell_setup also.",

Once the computes are configured, the cell_v2 discover_hosts\n    should be used to finalized the installation.\n    \n    In addition, the db syncs need to be reordered as the api db sync\n    should run before the the cell_v2 setup. The main db sync should run\n    after.\n    \n    map_cell0/simple_cell_setup now uses main nova DB connection instead\n    of the api DB connection.\n    \n    Change-Id: I591b451197dc3bd0783978f5e3d2b1c830afe54e\n    Closes-Bug: #1656276\n    Related-Bug: #1656673\n    Co-Authored-By: Alex Schultz <email address hidden>\n",
