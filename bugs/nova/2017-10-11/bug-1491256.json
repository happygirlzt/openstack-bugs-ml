This causes the log files to overlfow with data.\nAn example is http://208.91.1.172/logs/178652/3/1437935064/ the nova compute log file is 56M compared to all other files that are a few K.\nThis makes debugging and troubleshooting terribly difficult. This also has upgrade impact for people going to L from any other version and that is a degradation",
