It probably falls into either report class B2 (A vulnerability without a complete fix yet, security note for all versions, e.g., poor architecture / design) or C2 (A vulnerability, but not in OpenStack supported code, e.g., in a dependency) in our taxonomy, and so should not need an advisory: https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy",
