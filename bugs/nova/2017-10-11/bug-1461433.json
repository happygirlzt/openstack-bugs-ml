When the user dose not provide admin password, generate_password() in utils.py is used to generate an admin password. Generate_password() now uses two password symbol groups: default and easier, the default symbol group contains numbers, upper case letters and small case letters. the easier symbol group contains only numbers and upper case letters.  The generated password is not complex enough and can cause security problems.\n\nOne possible solution is to add a new symbol group: STRONGER_PASSWORD_SYMBOLS which contains numbers, upper case letters, lower case letters and also special characters such as `~!@#$%^&*()-_=+ and space. Then adding a new option in configuration file: generate_strong_password = True, when this option is set, nova will generate password using STRONGER_PASSWORD_SYMBOLS symbol group and with longer password length. If this option is not set, the password will be generated using the default symbol group and default length.",

There was no longer any point in switching it back to private security after that, so I have reset it to public security again.\n\nThis report requests a security improvement, increased complexity in autogenerated passwords, and as such is squarely class D (security hardening) in our report taxonomy: https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy\n\nI recommend switching this to a normal public bug, marking the security advisory task \"won't fix\" and adding the \"security\" tag to indicate a potential security hardening opportunity. If there are no objections, I'll do that early next week.",
