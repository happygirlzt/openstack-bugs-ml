However, now we get broken\n    again because stop_service fails when nova compute is not running.\n    This change makes it ignore failure to stop nova compute.\n    \n    Also, if n-cpu failed to start the first time, the n-cpu.failure file\n    that\n    was created will fail the service_check function in the end\n    of the deployment, although n-cpu might be in fact up, running and\n    healthy.\n    \n    Rename this file to `n-cpu.failure.before-restart-by-ironic` right after\n    stopping n-cpu so that it does not fail service_check later, but is\n    still\n    available for reference if needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idfe7d68d6ebeb786fe9e6da6a001a0ee2e10a76b\n    Closes-Bug: #1546058\n    Related-Bug: #1537076\n",
