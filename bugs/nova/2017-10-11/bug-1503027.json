    "description": "There is a configuration setting that affects the creation of quota_usages entries for resource tracking, until_refresh.  This setting is a count of the number of quota updates to allow before doing a sync of quota_usages to ensure that it is correct.  The configuration value operates by being written into the quota_usages table when a row is created, and then it is used/modified by quota tracking code thereafter.  If the value of until_refresh in the db row is None then the quota will never be checked against the actual usage and is at risk of drifting from the true usage value.\n\nWhen an instance boot request occurs part of the process is to ensure that there is a default security group created for a project.  If there is no default then one is created and a quota_usages entry is created to track the usage of the security group by the project.  This quota_usages creation sets until_refresh to None and completely ignore the configuration value that should affect that value.",

When it does that it sets until_refresh\n    to None rather than using the value of CONF.until_refresh like every\n    other quota_usages entry does.  This means that tracked security group\n    usages are at risk of getting out of sync with the actual usages and\n    bypass the healing mechanism that other quotas use.  This changes the\n    security group quota creation to honor until_refresh.\n    \n    Change-Id: I834cd09d42ed10ab7d5671c053162be2b1595f8e\n    Closes-bug: 1503027\n",
