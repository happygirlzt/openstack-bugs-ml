    "description": "When a user is created, there is a project auto-created.  However, Vpn.create is not called in UserManager::create_user (unlike UserManager::create_project)\n\nPerhaps the call to conn.create_project in create_user should actually be a call to self.create_project.  Or perhaps we need an explicit call to Vpn.create.  I think the former is better, because of DRY.\n\nThe problem manifests itself as an exception when calling nova-manage vpn list, because vpn_ip throws.  I think that code should also be fixed, so that it can cope if a project doesn't have a VPN assigned.",
