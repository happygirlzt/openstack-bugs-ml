This,\n    in turn, uses `_hard_reboot` to bring back the instances.\n    \n    The problem is that `_get_guest_xml` which `_hard_reboot` is using is always\n    making a call to Glance.show since `image_meta` isn't being passed into it. In\n    addition to this being an extra latency-heavy call, this is big problem\n    because the request is *server-generated* not *user-generated* so we won't\n    have the necessary user-request context to make the Glance call.\n    \n    In the absense of a general user-impersonation mechanism, the current\n    workaround is to use cached image-metadata, which works in this case as well.\n    \n    So the fix is to pass that `image_meta` that we already pull from instance\n    metadata in `_hard_reboot` and pass it into `_get_guest_xml` and thus avoid\n    the extra request to Glance.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2203ac709405ee784ee5ec017aa475575a46a0df\n    Closes-Bug: 1339386\n",
