    "description": "Lately when I've had to rebuild a virtual environment for testing I've had problems with run_tests.sh not working correctly.  I believe I've tracked the problem down to a problem with the latest python-subunit package.  When I let the venv use the latest (0.0.11) I get garbage output from the tests and it claims to have run 0 tests.  However, if I pin python-subunit to 0.0.10 then everything works as expected.\n\nThe problem does not seem to affect tox, which also appears to use subunit so I'm not sure whether it's a problem with the package or run_test's use of it.\n\nI'll attach the bad output from a test run.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that if I run testr directly without the --subunit flag it seems to work fine too.",

            "content": "The problem is with run_tests.sh use of subunit. Specifically with the --subunit option passed to testr and tools/colorizer.py's consumption of the resulting stream. Tox does not attempt to colorize the output which is why jenkins/tox do not have the same problem. I think colorizer.py expects the old stream version only and anything it doesn't recognize is passed through to stdout which is where the extra output is coming from.\n\nThe proper fix here would be to make tools/colorizer.py aware of the new subunit format instead of pinning to an older version. The new format was created in part to make the test result streams more robust and easy to debug (we really want to be using the new version). Robert may have ideas on how to do this properly.",
