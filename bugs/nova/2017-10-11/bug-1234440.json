Then the instance may be booted into non-trusted host.\n\nb) A flavor created specify the host aggregation requirement, but the AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter is not enabled, the user may have no idea.\n\nI think a mechanism is needed to make sure the contents in the extra_specs, or more general, all boot requirement, has been checked.\n\n--jyh",
