Deploy a VM, but force an exception in the spawn path somewhere to simulate some \"hypervisor error\u201d\n3. The scheduler correctly attempts to reschedule the VM, and ultimately ends up (correctly) with a NoValidHost error because there was only 1 host\n4. However, the instance.host (e.g., [nova show <vm>]) is still showing \u2018host-1\u2019\n\nAfter discussion on the mailing list and IRC, we decided this should be considered a bug since the instance is no longer tied to the host since it blew up in spawn and tried to reschedule.  As such, we should clear it out when the claim is aborted.",

Rather, we should nil these out at the end of the build\n    process so that the instance is not erroneously being associated\n    with stale host/node information.\n    \n    Also included are a few cosmetic updates in comments and eliminating\n    some implied 'None' parameters from \"dict.get(key, None)\" calls I\n    found during the course of investigating this change.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4d9c90b1d3fcce5237323fffcc6db1fb93d23e37\n    Closes-Bug: #1427944\n",
