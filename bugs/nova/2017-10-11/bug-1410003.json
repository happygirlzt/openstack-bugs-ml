    "description": "We have a requirement to collect quota usage information at project level with admin role account. We noticed that the only api we can work with currently is to get them one by one:\nRequest: GET     /v2/{tenant_id}/limits/?tenant_id={tenant_id}\nRefer to:\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/GET_os-used-limits-for-admins-v2_getCustomerLimits__v2__tenant_id__limits__tenant_id__ext-compute_limits_admins.html\n\nIn production env, we maintained 1K projects at least. So with this API, we have to get the summary with 1K http requests.(O(n), n is the number of projects).\n\nThis would cause low performance if we check the quota usages frequently. I would hope there's an API similar to the way we did for instances summary(/v2/\u200b{tenant_id}\u200b/servers/detail?all_tenant=True) which is use a \"all_tenants\" parameter to return the summary list we want. \n\nThat would totally solve the performance issue we met(O(n) -> O(1)). I just wrote a prototype to get this down and hope it would be helpful to describe the issue. Code link is here:\nhttps://github.com/henryzzq/nova/compare/stable/icehouse?expand=1 \n\nAlso attached a design doc about this issue.",
