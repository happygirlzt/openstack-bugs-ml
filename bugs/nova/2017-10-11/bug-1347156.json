The gate tests are passing\n    because they all run with tenant isolation.\n    \n    The root cause of the problem is cooperation between\n    commit 23a27e47 and cbbb9de5. db layer code return floatingip_ref\n    but object layer didn't. This patch fixed the problem by adding return\n    value from object layer.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ide1a338b6c33676311028e8738150e146324a8ee\n    Closes-Bug: #1347156\n",
