The problem is that the same XenAPISession() will be used for multiple outstanding queries.  XenAPISession.wait_for_task() sets various variables within the instance to track a query from which it is waiting for a response.  If another query is started, those variables are overwritten.   Doh.  Solution is to make xenapi_conn.py handle multiple outstanding queries correctly.",
