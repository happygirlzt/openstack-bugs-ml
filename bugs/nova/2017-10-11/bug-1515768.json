    "description": "Summary:\nThis issue is observed frequently on Jenkins gate and has been reproducible in local setup too.\n\nSteps:\nInitiate 3 stack create requests at once in a script:\n\nheat stack-create -f /home/stack/template_file stack1\nheat stack-create -f /home/stack/template_file stack2\nheat stack-create -f /home/stack/template_file stack3\n\nusing the following HOT file:\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/479920/\n\n\nOne of the stack creations fails with CreateFailed: Resource Create Failed: Conflict: Resources. vdu3: Port Is Still In Use.\n\nFrom the nova logs, there are duplicate bridges created for one of the servers. The qemu xml fails with libvirtError: Unable to create tap device tapd3a3d9e9-5d: Device or resource busy. See timestamp 2015-11-25 23:03:14.940 in n-cpu.log\n\nAttaching the relevant n-cpu.log, q-svc.log and h-eng.log\n\nObservation:\nThe 1st network interface for the nova instance is a Neutron Port resource provided in HOT template.\nNova sends a PUT request to update the port information. It also sends 2 POST requests for the 2nd and 3rd network interfaces.\nNeutron receives the PUT request and sends network-event changed event while nova is still waiting for the POST response for the 2 ports.\nIf the network-changed event is received before the 3rd port POST response is received, refresh_cache is acquired by nova_service\nNova sends a query for port information, updates the cache and release the lock.\nBy then, POST requests are completed which acquires the cache lock again and sends request for network info. refresh_cache is updated twice and contains duplicate set of ports\nNetwork vifs are built for all 6 ports and qemu xml is build based on that.\nDuplicate bridges in xml is complained by libvirt as device or resource busy.\n\nVersion and environment:\nDevstack Master",
