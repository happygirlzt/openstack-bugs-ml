            "content": "I don't think this is a straigtforward fix.\n\nDeleted flavors may still be in use by running instances so its quite a valid request to retreive information about them. At the very least we need the ability to specify that we want to show information for a deleted flavor. \n\nIts unclear whether this is intentional behavior or not (being able to show deleted flavors) so I think its probably worth bringing up on the mailing list to see if we should change it for V2. \n\nFor V3 I think we need some wider changes to the flavors API, and am planning on bringing it up at summit",
