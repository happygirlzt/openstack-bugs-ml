(e.g. volume\n    list)  If the call to cinder lands on a slow performing or otherwise bad\n    cinder API node, the user of Nova API will see poor performance.\n    \n    This patch adds the ability to control HTTP timeouts when calling the\n    cinder API.  By configuring a timeout, nova will be able to more quickly\n    retry its cinder request and hopefully land on a better performing\n    cinder API node.  This will help make the API response times more\n    predictable.\n    \n    For backward compatibility, the default timeout value is None.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1329797\n    DocImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: I5cccced524d9a9d69ed41f755781d0b7ae3dc970\n",
