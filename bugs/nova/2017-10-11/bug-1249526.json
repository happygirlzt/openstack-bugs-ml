It would\nhave to be handled in the usual way for extending the V2 API though  - eg\nadding another extension so it can be detected when that feature will be\navailable.\n\nMore broadly speaking we discussed at summit perhaps closing V2 API\ndevelopment at the end of I-2 (assuming V3 is looking good by that stage) -\nexcept for bug fixes of course.",
