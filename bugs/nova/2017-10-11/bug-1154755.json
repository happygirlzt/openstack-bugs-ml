    "description": "Cells code in trunk combined with console support expects that consoleauth runs in the API cell.  Ie, get_vnc_console() in cells mode queries down to the compute node for an instance to get console information, but then sends that info to consoleauth in the API cell to get a token.\n\nSome (somewhat recent) security fixes related to consoleauth tokens broke this behavior.  These fixes, on instance deletion, call  to consoleauth from the compute manager to delete any tokens for the instance.  This does not work because consoleauth is in the API cell on a separate rabbit server.  Also:  now when consoleauth validates tokens, it makes a call to the compute manager to verify the console port is still the same.  But, again, the compute manager is in a child cell on a different rabbit server.",

The only purpose it could serve would be log a traceback on failure\n    on the compute manager side, but that seems unnecessary.  There's no\n    return value.  This patch changes it to an rpc.cast instead.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1154755\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic763f2a5c0dcff7b7ccfac5927680e7881605f61\n",
