However, there was a logical error introduced,\n    whereby migrations with a value of None for their updated_at attribute\n    were considered as more recent than those with actual values. This fixes\n    that logic so that None values always sort as older than actual values.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1611458\n    \n    Change-Id: If4feceb9e385f962fdf690f3ed62f63a19c61d7d\n",
