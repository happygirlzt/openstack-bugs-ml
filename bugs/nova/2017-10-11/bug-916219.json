    "description": "Most of the \"nova *-list\" commands are with respect to a given user. \"nova list\" is so documented but instead shows the vms of multiple users. However, \"nova show xx\" only lets you see details of your own vms. If you provide xx as the id of another user's vm as shown by \"nova list\" then you get the following strange error, regardless of which xx you use:\n\nNo image with a name or ID of '2' exists.\n\nThis was while running nova packages built from a recent diablo-stable, using \n\npython-novaclient          2.6.4~bzr112-0ubuntu1\n\nThe same thing happens with the most recent nova client from github.",
