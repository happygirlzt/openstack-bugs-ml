Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 23 11:44:05 2014 +0100\n\n    virt: fix signature of set_admin_password method\n    \n    The compute manager passes (instance, new_pass) to the\n    set_admin_password method, and the XenAPI driver impl\n    expects this pair of parameters. The ComputeManager\n    class, however, declares that it takes (instance, context,\n    new_pass=None). It makes no sense to default the new\n    password to None, when the only caller always passes\n    it, and the context parameter is never passed by the\n    caller either.\n    \n    Partial-bug: #1333219\n    Change-Id: If656da4ef54a0425b9f50ef03af044b803b1afae\n",
