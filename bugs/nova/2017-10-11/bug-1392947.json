If some exceptions happen before creating\n    domain succesfully like failure of connecting volume to destination host,\n    then we can't destroy instance in method rollback_live_migration_at_destination.\n    In this case we don't remove the instance's directory, this will lead an\n    DestinationDiskExists when live migration same instance to same destination.\n    This commit ensure the instance's directory is always cleaned at destination\n    host. This commit also extracts instance path calculation into a utility function.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1392947\n    Change-Id: If86e73b07f17d28078ee48983e9e92aafb30d913\n",
