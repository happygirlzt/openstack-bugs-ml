    "description": "If API times out on a RPC during the processing of a migrate_server it does not revert the task_state back to NULL before or after sending the error response back to the user. This can prevent further API operations on the VM and leave a good VMs in non-operable state with the exception of perhaps a delete.\n\nThis is one possible reproducer. I'm not sure if this is always true, and I'd appreciate if someone else confirm it.\n\n1. Somehow make RPC requests hang\n2. Issue a live migration request\n3. The call should return an HTTP error (409 perhaps)\n4. Check VM. It should be in a good state but the task_state stuck in 'migrating'",
