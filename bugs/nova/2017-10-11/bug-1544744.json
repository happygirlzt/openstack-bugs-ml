            "content": "Sujitha,\nThis is what I gather from your bug report. \nEssentially, are you suggesting that an instance should move back to ACTIVE state in the event of an error during live migrate?\nI think the possibility of reverting the vm state depends, at least partly, on where and when the error occurred. If the error occurs say during the pre-checks, it is probably safe to revert the vm state. \nHowever, if the error occurs after the live migrate process has commenced, we can't be sure of the changes that may have happened to the instance and whether it'd be appropriate to revert the vm state.\n\nTalking more specifically about what you reported here:\nIt looks like the failing method is 'check_can_live_migrate_source', which is one of the pre-checks for live migrate.\nSo, maybe it's safe in this case to reset the vm state?\n\nLooking more closely, it appears that 'initialize_connection' is wrapped with 'translate_volume_exception', where cinder's ClientExceptions, specifically, 'NotFound' and 'BadRequest' are being handled and transformed into either 'VolumeNotFound' or 'InvalidInput' exceptions [1] that Nova understands. However, since the exception in this case is neither of the above mentioned types, so it is re-raised. It eventually bubbles up the stack and gets caught at [2], where the vm state is set to ERROR.\n\nSo, maybe we can catch the unexpected exceptions at [3] and raise a MigrationPreCheckError that is expected and handled appropriately at [2]? This would leave the instance in whatever state it was earlier. \nAlthough doing this means all the unexpected error would now show up as MigrationPreCheckErrors. I'm not sure if that's desirable or not.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is the correct approach or not. Let's see what other nova folks have to say.\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/836180bcdb799a06deb0ad62f6bfb06930e20e3a/nova/volume/cinder.py#L235-L241\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/58dafee0d931e2330e9ee6012d5558e022fc26fe/nova/conductor/manager.py#L308-L336\n[3] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/137ddac8ef23bb0c4c8572f10a5066f34c9e8b20/nova/compute/manager.py#L5079-L5107",

I try to attach volume to my instance, according to your suggestion I changed code to raise cinderclient exception during initialize_connection\n2a. Exception is raised, volume is not attached to the VM, VM is in ACTIVE state\n2b . Removed exception from initialize_connection as per description it should happen during volume-attach, not during live migration\n3. I try to live migrate VM, everything works fine, VM moved to destination, state is ACTIVE\n\nIf you wanted to write that cinderclient exception should be raised during live migration then this bug is a duplicate of https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1405294",

            "content": "@pawel, I think the idea here is to add an exception into that line of code.\n\n@hemanth, you are right. If this problem happening post live-migrate, going into the ERROR state is correct, because the admin needs to clean up, and there is no sensible way to revert the operation. If this happens during the pre-live-migrate setup/checks, we probably should go back to ACTIVE, if we can do a full revert.\n\nSo I think incomplete is a valid state, while we narrow down the issue we are talking about here.",
