    "description": "When doing a clean_reboot, it's possible that a guest kernel is completely hung in a way that causes the XenAPI clean_reboot task to not ever finish.   We need to find a way to time those out if they don't complete within 'x' period of time...  When that happens, we need to cancel the task, and then issue a hard reboot instead.\n\nNote: It might also be desirable that if you get a 'hard reboot' request via the API... and there's a 'clean_reboot' task that is currently outstanding... that we go ahead and cancel the clean_reboot task and then issue the hard reboot task.",
