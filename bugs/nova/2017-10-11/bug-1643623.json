            "content": "@mriedem: I think my bug title is confusing. In the above scenario migration doesn't happen at all as it does not have valid host in the environment but instance task state is stuck in migrating. But for the end user it might be little confusing as this particular instance would not have migration id set to use 'nova live-migration-abort'. Above instance can be reset to active state by 'nova reset-state', but this can be avoided by resetting vm state to active at this place https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L3695.",
