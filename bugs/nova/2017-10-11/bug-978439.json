This could result in returning invalid XML.\n    \n    This is addressed by using utils.xhtml_escape() on purposeful eC2 error\n    responses and when handling webob.exc.HTTPException.\n    \n    Extended the tests for utils.xhtml_escape() to cover '&', '>', '<' and a tag\n    look-alike. These conversions are implicit to saxutils.escape().\n    \n    Change-Id: Icb3e861c6c06c0d9c3b9e2ab1a658581a0fb39c6\n",
