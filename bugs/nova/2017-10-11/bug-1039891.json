    "description": "If for any reason a libvirt-based VM becomes unregistered, there is currently no mechanism for recovering without administrative intervention.  Discussing this with Vish, we agreed it was prudent to validate and accordingly define domains with libvirt on hard_reboot or hypervisor reboot.  My personal opinion is that hard_reboot should generally make as few assumptions as possible about the state of a hypervisor, so that users can recover their VMs reliably by simply rebooting them.\n\nTo reproduce this problem:\n\n1. Start a VM normally via the API or Horizon.\n\n2. Connect to the hypervisor running the VM:\n    virsh destroy <instance>\n    virsh undefine <instance>\n\n3. Issue user-level API calls, such as reboot.  Observe that the VM cannot be recovered.\n\nConsider the use case whereby a hypervisor has a hardware problem and needs to be swapped out for new equipment.  The system is rebuilt on new hardware with the same hostname, whereby Nova's instances directory is on NAS/Ceph.  It comes back online and attempts to start all the VMs previously running on the machine, which all fail.  Without a mechanism for re-defining a domain, none of these VMs can start again without taking manual steps.",
