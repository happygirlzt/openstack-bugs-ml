    "description": "Change b7e9a64416ff239a4c1b8501f398796b02c46ce7 introduces a filter_deleted flag into the metadata_to_dict function in nova/utils.py and modified two utility functions to use this flag.  Unfortunately, the value passed makes these utility functions behave differently:\n\ndef instance_sys_meta(instance) -> sets filter_deleted=True -> change in behavior (now includes deleted instance_system_metadata)\n\ndef get_image_from_system_metadata(system_meta) -> sets filter_deleted=True -> change in behavior (now includes deleted instance_system_metadata)\n\nIt's never a good idea to change the expected behavior of utility functions.  I propose to fix this as follows:\n\n(1) Fix bug #1496394, which will change the name of the flag from 'filter_deleted' to 'include_deleted' in the base function so hopefully this problem won't happen again.\n\n(2) Change the signatures of the two functions mentioned above to have an optional 'include_deleted' parameter whose default setting will preserve the original behavior of these functions.\n\n(3) The change that introduced the flag was made to support the display of metadata on deleted instances for server-detail-list calls using the changes_since parameter, so check usage of the utility functions and include passing the 'include_deleted' parameter if appropriate.",
