The bug here is at service start up, ie starting nova-compute with a mysql server that is not up (yet) ends in:\n\n(nova): TRACE: OperationalError: (OperationalError) (2003, \"Can't connect to MySQL server on 'outo.home.base' (111)\") None None\n\nand a dead process.\n\nInitial setup of the database connection does not retry, and instead the service dies (quickly).   This can't really be worked around in packaging/upstart and shouldn't need to be, as a database is truly and external resource anyway.  In contrast, the rabbitmq connection initialization loops at start up if it cannot connect to its server, dumping tracebacks to nova-$foo.log but at least keeps the service up and makes a connection when the server appears.\n\n ",

It's been mentioned that the same logic should be a part of nova or openstack-common as well.  If it lands there, it will also resolve this issue for nova.   \n\nMarking as critical in Ubuntu,  adding a task for Glance + tagging  essex-rc-potential as this is a serious issue for anyone expecting these services to start reliably.\n\nNote, Keystone seems to initialize its database lazily and not touch till a request comes in.  I'm not sure about quantum?",
