'dom.XMLDesc(0)' will return the guest XML document based on the current guest state. Since the guest is running in both these cases, it will get getting the *live* XML instead of the persistent XML.\n\nSo these methods are deleting the persistent XML and replacing it with the live XML. These two different XML documents are not guaranteed to contain the same information.\n\nAs a second problem, it is not requesting inclusion of security information, so any SPICE/VNC password set in the persistent XML is getting lost\n\nThe fix is to replace\n\n  dom.XMLDesc(0) \n\nwith\n\n  dom.XMLDesc(libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INACTIVE |\n                               libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE)\n\nin the _live_snapshot and _swap_volume functions.",
