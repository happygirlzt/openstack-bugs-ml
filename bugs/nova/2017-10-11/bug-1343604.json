Upstream\n    applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could\n    inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the\n    log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke\n    strutils.mask_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the\n    exception.\n    \n    Cherry-pick from review.openstack.org/109417\n    Partial-Bug: #1343604\n    \n    Change-Id: I9741dcdebdb4bed295ddc5ec4c4b117fffcfe88c\n",
