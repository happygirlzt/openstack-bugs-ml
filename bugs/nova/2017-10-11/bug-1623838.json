It is available in version 0.7.18, which is what the upper-constraints.txt has. I haven't investigate (yet) when the new method was introduce in netaddr, though in all reasonableness, I'd strongly suggest pushing for an upgrade of global-requirements.txt to 0.7.18 (which is what we've been gating on for a long time).\n\nAt the packaging level, it doesn't seem to be a big problem, as 0.7.18 is what Xenial has.\n\nThe other solution would be to remove the call of modified_eui64() in Nova, but this looks a more risky option to me, so close from the release.",

That said, given the effort, I'm investigating the possibility to fix the testcase so that we could backport the bugfix to the Newton branch.",
