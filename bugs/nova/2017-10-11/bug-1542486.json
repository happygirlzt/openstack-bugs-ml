This is not\n      backward compatible within Mitaka cycle, but it is between Liberty &\n      Mitaka.\n    * Add 2 new domain-related parameters: neutron_user_domain_name and\n      neutron_project_domain_name, both defaults to 'Default'.\n    * Add /v3 for neutron_auth_url parameter. It's now required in Nova.\n      The parameter can still be changed if users want to run v2 (before\n      Mitaka) but it will break at some point.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: David Moreau Simard <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Emilien Macchi <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I1a99a050ba70399f045930e26e52719bb53a75b3\n    Related-Bug: #1542486\n",

So that's not causing your issue.\n\nBased purely on the description it sounds like the user you are registering does not have admin priviledges. If you want to authenticate a user that works on multiple projects you have the admin role. Can you check the role list of the neutron user in the service/services project on both?",
