    "description": "When nova creates a hypervisor from an Ironic node, the hypervisor is created with hypervisor_hostname set to the UUID of the Ironic node. This is inconvenient, as it's not very human-friendly. It would be nice if the hypervisor_hostname attribute could be set to the node's name, or at least some combination, such as `node.name + '-' + node.uuid`. The relevant line is here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/kilo/nova/virt/ironic/driver.py#L290\n\nThis is on CentOS 7, and yum shows me as running version 2015.1.1.dev18 for all nova packages.\n\nI tried just changing the line above to read `'hypervisor_hostname': str(node.name),`, but this caused no hypervisors to get created, although nothing crashed, which makes it seem like there's more that needs to be done than just changing that line.",
