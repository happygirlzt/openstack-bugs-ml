    "description": "Upon instance termination, the libvirt driver does not clean up nwfilter rules for the instance.  As a result, these rules stay resident both on disk and in memory, causing a steady performance degradation that makes several critical operations very slow over time, including:\n\n* instance launching\n* nova-compute startup\n* security group modifications\n\nAs a result of this, on Nebula it can take 30+ minutes for compute hosts to restart after upgrades, and many minutes for instances to launch.",
