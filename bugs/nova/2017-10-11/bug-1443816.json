But the ssh key was only stored at parent\n    api cells. Therefore the conductor service will throw ssh key not found\n    exception.\n    \n    There are three solutions:\n    1. add keypair_type into the instance object, along side keypair_name, etc\n    2. Sync ssh keypair to every child cell database\n    3. consider sending a message to the parent cell to fetch the keypair\n    \n    This commit prefer to use third solution. Because of the data ssh\n    keypair should be global. And cells v2 split key_pairs table into global\n    API tables.\n    \n    Change-Id: I156a1c3cf3e31f34cea5e240b14a9575e9e45239\n    Closes-Bug: #1443816\n",
