    "description": "When XenStore is populated with the network configuration information, it puts DNS entries in for all subnets on a given network. In some cases, such as when a network has both a v6 and v4 address present, the DNS information for each subnet is the same. Currently, this will cause Nova to write duplicate DNS IPs into the XenStore network info. This can later cause an agent to pick this up and fail trying to configure duplicate DNS entries. This is happening on Folsom trunk (post F2). It has probably been in place back in Essex as well.",
