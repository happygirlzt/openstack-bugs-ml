And it's redundant with another Tempest test, so probably needs to be removed or rewritten to include a server.\n\nThere is the test_stamp_pattern scenario test which snapshots a volume-backed server, but it's currently being skipped (I'm working on unskipping it).\n\nSo I think we basically need to cleanup https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/tempest/api/compute/volumes/test_volume_snapshots.py#L42 or add another set of tests in there which do the following:\n\n1. snapshot a volume-backed server that is active (default case)\n2. snapshot a volume-backed server that is shutdown\n3. snapshot a volume-backed server that is paused\n4. snapshot a volume-backed server that is suspended\n\nI could see most of that test code being common code in the module, with individual tests calling it and passing in or handling the pre-condition for the server state.",
