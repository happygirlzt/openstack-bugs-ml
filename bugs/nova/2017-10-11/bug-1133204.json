The result is\n    that the instance rebuild operation is tried against the\n    original failed host and will always fail.\n    \n    Rename locally used variable to a different name and modify\n    relevant test to prohibit this from happening again.\n    \n    Resolves bug 1133204.\n    \n    Change-Id: I517b2dc19d9561723391150105b4943b56dba637\n",
