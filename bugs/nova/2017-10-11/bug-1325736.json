Whenever someone needs to enter both an ingress and egress rule for the same port they have to enter it twice, remembering all of the information they need (since it can't be cloned). If they forget to flip the direction the second time from the default value, it'll error out as a duplicate and they'll have to try a third time. If they messed up the second rule, there's no edit, so they would have to delete it if they got a value wrong and do it all over again. \n\nIt would be awesome if the UI allowed for specifying both an ingress and egress rule at the same time, even if all it did was create the ingress and egress rows and put them in the table, at least they'd be guaranteed to have the same configuration.",

So I don't add neutron to the affected project.\n\n[comments as my horizon hat]\nThe feature completely depends on the backend service, i.e., neutron now, so there is nothing to do in horizon. Thus this is invalid as horizon.\n\n",
