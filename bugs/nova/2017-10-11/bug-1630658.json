Bad move.\n\nAnyway. I believe the logs show the following:\n\n1. There are - at least ;-) - two hypervisors with sufficient disk space:\n\n   openstack hypervisor show 3:\n   vcpus_used 0\n   free_disk_gb 49\n\n   openstack hypervisor show 5:\n   vcpus_used 0\n   free_disk_gb 49\n\n2. It is possible to schedule servers to both hypervisors:\n\n   7 x nova boot --image cirros --flavor m1.tiny\n\n   openstack hypervisor show 3:\n   vcpus_used 5\n   free_disk_gb 45\n\n   openstack hypervisor show 5:\n   vcpus_used 3\n   free_disk_gb 46\n\n3. There is diskspace remaining on control02 (id 5) after trying to schedule:\n  \n   nova boot --image CentOS-7-x86_64-GenericCloud-1608.qcow2 --flavor m1.small three\n\n   openstack hypervisor show 5:\n   vcpus_used 0\n   free_disk_gb 49\n  \n\n4. Nova fails to schedule, even though there is sufficient disk on control02 (id 5):\n\n  'DiskFilter: (start: 4, end: 2)'\n\n\n\n  The DiskFilter *should* have returned '3' (both Hyper-V hosts also had sufficient disk + control02)",
