    "description": "After a nova-compute starts, it takes some time for the capabilities to be sent to schedulers. It may make the schedulers send unacceptable requests to the nova-compute. It is most likely when the nova-compute runs for the first time; an entry in compute_nodes table is created, but the schedulers still don't know its capabilities, then the schedulers assume that the nova-compute has empty capabilities.",

It may make the schedulers\n    send unacceptable requests to the nova-compute. This patch eliminates\n    it by sending the capabilities before creating the entry in compute_node.\n    \n    Change-Id: Id9851d9a6f0305256dfa6dfb63ab508e6f519fa2\n",
