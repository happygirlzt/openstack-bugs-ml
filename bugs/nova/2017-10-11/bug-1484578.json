    "description": "To cooperate with blocking calls, which can't be monkey-patched,  eventlet provides support for wrapping those into native OS threads by the means of eventlet.tpool module. E.g. nova-compute uses it extensively to make sure calls to libvirt does not block the whole process.\n    \nWhen used in unit tests, eventlet.tpool creates a pool of 20 native OS threads per test running process (assuming there was at least one unit test to actually execute this part of the code in this process).\n    \nIn unit tests all blocking calls (like calls to libvirt) are monkey-patched anyway, so there is little sense to wrap those by the means of tpool.execute() (as we don't want to test eventlet either).",
