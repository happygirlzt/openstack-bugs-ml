    "description": "A VXLAN DVS portgroup will contain the UUID of the netron network. It will not contain the name-UUID as proposed in patch 709127cabed602d6868dedf0bef7ca9547a86e06. The reason for this is that the the VC has a maximum length of 80 characters for the name of a port group. A VXLAN port group also needs to contain then DVS and VDN scope morefs.\nThe fact that the name is included in the search for the matching portgroup leads to instances not being able to be booted and a error 'No available host'",

The original design included the\n    name of the network in the port group. The name was excluded due\n    to VC limitations (maximum of 80 characters for a port group name).\n    This prevents instances from being booted as there is no match\n    for the port group.\n    \n    The fix ensures that we only use the Neutron network UUID.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7e3223f88c4f477116ac493eb45466ea1c0a29a9\n    Closes-bug: #1415461\n",
