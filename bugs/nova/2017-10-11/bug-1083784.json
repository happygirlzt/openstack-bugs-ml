    "description": "In the nova compute manager, when starting up nova compute plug_vifs() is only called a single time (for the first instance found) in the enumerate loop within \"init_host\".  This results incorrectly populated iptables rules in the filter table when you utilize a networking model that is not the \"flat\" networking model.\n\nThe case where this is problematic is when the following is true:\n  * iptables filter table is missing the requisite rules for a given bridge\n  * the instances are already running \n  * Nova Compute is being started\n\nIf the instances are not running (but should be) the call to resume_state_on_host_boot calls hard_reboot, which in turn calls plug_vifs() (and properly sets up the iptables rules).\n\nCurrently the code is assuming that the \"flat\" networking model is used",
