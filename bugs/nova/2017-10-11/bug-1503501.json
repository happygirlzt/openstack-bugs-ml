This is a squashed fix for all of them\n    as none can land without the others.\n    \n    Issue #1 - oslo.db\n    \n    Add testresources used by oslo.db fixture\n    \n    If we use oslo.db fixtures, we'll need the package or\n    the next version of oslo.db release will break us.\n    \n    (Cherry-picked from 4bcc26487837b7ece7797f88622dea1b6d09bd94)\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1503501\n    \n    Issue #2 - oslo.versionedobjects\n    \n    Drop unused obj_to_primitive() override\n    \n    This was a band-aid override until o.vo gained the obj_relationships fix\n    that this method overrides. That has been in place since o.vo 0.8.0, which\n    means this is long since no longer necessary (and is actually blocking our\n    ability to absorb bug fixes to this code in o.vo).

Stop using LOG.exception in contexts with no sys.exc_info set\n    \n    Python 3.4 logger fills in record.exc_info with sys.exc_info() result\n    [1], and then it uses it to determine the current exception [2] to\n    append to the log message. Since there is no exception, exc_info[1] is\n    None, and we get AttributeError inside traceback module.\n    \n    It's actually a bug in Python interpreter that it attempt to access the\n    attribute when there is no exception. It turns out that it's fixed in\n    latest master of cPython [3] (the intent of the patch does not seem\n    relevant, but it removes the offending code while reshuffling the code).\n    Note that now cPython correctly checks the exception value before\n    accessing its attributes [4].\n    \n    The patch in cPython that resulted in the failure is [5] and is present\n    since initial Python 3k releases.\n    \n    The patch in fixtures that broke us is [6].\n    \n    [1]: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/logging/__init__.py#l1412\n    [2]: https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/tip/Lib/logging/__init__.py#l575\n    [3]: https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/73afda5a4e4c\n    [4]: https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/73afda5a4e4c#l6.484\n    [5]: https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/2ee09afee126\n    [6]: https://github.com/testing-cabal/fixtures/commit/67dd2956943261e845a866dab155208c51da937e\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1503847\n    Closes-Bug: #1504053\n    Co-Authored-By: Ihar Hrachyshka <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I456b7846b8a53e4d3f8c91583685e0e1eaa84719\n    (cherry picked from commit 8f58bbf38f5984e70d6e0be7427deb99d7782d1d)\n",

But\n    as per oslo.log docs [1], we should make sure that what we pass into the\n    library is unicode.\n    \n    Http.request returns a tuple of Response object and a string, which is\n    bytes in Python 2.x [2].\n    \n    That's why we need to convert the response content to unicode before\n    passing it into oslo.log.\n    \n    To achieve it, we utilize encodeutils.safe_decode with 'replace' errors\n    handling strategy, so that we don't get exceptions on input that does\n    not conform unicode.\n    \n    For the unit test case, we pass a string that is not expected to convert\n    to unicode with errors='strict' strategy or similar, and check that we\n    still don't crash.\n    \n    While at it, we remove a check for the number of log calls being\n    triggered, because it's something that we should avoid validating in\n    test cases, and it cannot trigger a real bug. The mock that was used to\n    count the number would also hide the bug that we try to reproduce.\n    \n    Note that the bug does not require debug to be set because the crash\n    occurs before oslo.log machinery decides it should not log the message.\n    \n    [1]: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.log/usage.html#no-more-implicit-conversion-to-unicode-str\n    [2]: http://bitworking.org/projects/httplib2/doc/html/libhttplib2.html#httplib2.Http.request\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1501772\n    Change-Id: I6a32c40ff117fae43913386134c8981539697ce8\n    (cherry picked from commit 80e3d9be4923ecad17377b1d15c8392b8a43dac6)\n\ncommit 48a9cd433c09bbf4b80a4665f625cd3754db0f00\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Oct 2 06:33:59 2015 +0000\n\n    Imported Translations from Zanata\n    \n    For more information about this automatic import see:\n    https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Translations/Infrastructure\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib6bba07a6f0cb3c2f9eda98c5f9f0c93c84e2ea0\n\ncommit 2ed841f58d931bc9a2d29172d26c03d7cb6862e6\nAuthor: Terry Wilson <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Sep 28 17:42:25 2015 -0500\n\n    Check idl.run() return value before blocking\n    \n    The IDL change_seqno can change as a result of running idl.run(), and\n    it returns True if there has been a change.
