Though looking in to the code in the master I believe bug is still there\nHypervisor: libvirt\nFrequency: very rare, under heavy load (stress tests)\nSteps to reproduce: as an operator I issue \"nova delete\" command. Instead of being deleted that vm gets into ERROR state.\n\nrelevant nova-compute.log: http://paste.openstack.org/show/183111/\n\nHere's probably why it happens:\nIt's a race condition. There are two threads (coroutines if eventlet patched) - thread-1 which handles termination request (nova.compute.manager.ComputeManager.terminate_instance) and thread-2 which dispatches events from hypervisor.\n1) thread-1: manager clears (deletes) all queued events for that vm and switches to thread-2 https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/983f755562cb87a0b498af5d62be9bd2010bc999/nova/compute/manager.py#L2526\n2) thread-2: hypervisor emits one more event and switches to thread-1 without dispatching event\n3) thread-1: manager deletes image files, marks instance as deleted in the db. Thread finishes and exits normally\n4) thread-2: manager tries to dispatch one more event. But fails as there is no such instance anymore. To be more precise - there is no InstanceInfoCache for that vm.\n\n\nUPD: more logs: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/r0ek3w7g95qoetw/AADTfgN9tD2Mt_fOXjB9OCzva?dl=0\n- Cluster is in HA mode (three nova-api files)\n- debug=False\n- conductor-logs contain only \"connecting, reconnecting to rabbitmq\". \n- cat ... | grep -A 15 -B 15 -r 09ac0ed2-07cb-4394-b0c8-aff3ab74dcdb",
