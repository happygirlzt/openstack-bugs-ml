What I would expect is that when a VM is rebuilt, the new hostname would be applied to that VM and not the original hostname.  I did some testing in a Havana environment and found that updating the hostname field in addition to display_name seems to fix the bug just fine.",

Maybe that needs to be a parameter on the rebuild API since we preserve the IP network settings and storage for the instance through the rebuild, so changing the hostname could mess with anything that's relying on that to be unchanged through the rebuild.",

I was also concerned whether the guest will actually consume the hostname from metadata again when rebuilt. I assume from your patch that it does, since virt domain is destroyed and recreated during a rebuild.\n\nAlso mentioned in the bug report, what about updating in dnsmasq? Point being, I don't think updating the hostname is as simple and would take more work to change it in the db, make the guest take the new name (without a rebuild or anything), update it in dnsmasq, etc.\n\n--\n\nSo I think this is definitely a bigger API change and would require a spec to consider the impact of a change in behavior like this.\n\nSee https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/readme.html for submitting a spec.",
