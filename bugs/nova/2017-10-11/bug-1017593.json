            "content": "Need to re-open this issue.  Using reset for hard_reboot is not reliable, even where it is supported by libvirt.  Hard reboots are one of the only ways to recover a VM in a broken state.  The reset command assumes the domain is running in some capacity and will fail if it is not.  Here are some steps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create a new libvirt VM (using qemu for my testing).\n\n2. virsh list # validate it is running\n\nvirsh # list\n Id Name                 State\n----------------------------------\n  3 instance-00000001    running\n\n3. Find and kill -9 the pid of the qemu/kvm process.  virsh list --all to confirm:\n\nvirsh # list --all\n Id Name                 State\n----------------------------------\n  - instance-00000001    shut off\n\n4. Issue a virsh reset, as the code would do:\n\nvirsh # reset instance-00000001\nerror: Failed to reset domain instance-00000001\nerror: Requested operation is not valid: domain is not running\n\nThere is no way to recover this VM without manual intervention.  Reverting to the hold behavior, by commenting out the conditional and forcing the code below works much more reliably:\n\n            self._destroy(instance)\n            self._create_domain(xml, virt_dom)\n\nHard reset is the current sledgehammer for fixing issues and it really needs to stay that way.",
