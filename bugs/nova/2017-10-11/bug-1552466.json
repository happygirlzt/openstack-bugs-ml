These have\n    ways of failing. If they do fail, we need to cleanup what we've done in\n    the deploy so far (instance fields on the node in ironic, firewalls,\n    vifs, etc).\n    \n    Wrap the configdrive build call in a try/except to catch any errors,\n    clean up, and re-raise the error.\n    \n    Change-Id: I81ec4c54437d92c4c091646c0b3f5d948b82b52b\n    Closes-Bug: #1552466\n",
