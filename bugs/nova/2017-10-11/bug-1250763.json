Not only does this cause an\n    unnecessary re-authentication (The user may/should also have an admin\n    role in Neutron) it means that they can no longer allocate and assign\n    a floating IP to their instance via Nova (as the floating ip will now\n    always be allocated in the context of neutron_admin_tenant).\n    \n    This change removes the context.is_admin check to revert to the\n    previous behaviour where the used of admin creds is determined just\n    on the explicit use of \"admin=True\" parameter to get_client().\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib1720420c778960bc90c5b7d703de936ebb7d6b5\n    Closes-Bug: 1250763\n",
