Is it the case that a translation containing double-byte characters can basically render a service completely unusable?\n\n2) Our fear is that the fix is complex enough such that there's a reasonable chance it's broken in some way\n\ni.e. this is a critical issue and we don't have a huge amount of confidence that this fix resolves the issue without introducing further issues\n\nThat all suggests that we should disable lazy translation in all projects and revisit in Icehouse\n\nThis would involve removing the calls to gettextutils.enable_lazy() or gettextutils.install(lazy=True)\n\nBut we're eager to hear thoughts from folks more intimately familiar with the work - e.g. mrodden, luisg, bnemec, jswarren",

We met with dhellman, and bnemec on IRC. \n\nWe all agree that the current proposal of basically changing the Message class at a fundamental level so that it is immutable is a no-go for Havana, given the complexity of the fix and risk for regressions.\n\nHowever given how the issue is limited to logging, there is a different approach that was proposed by dhellman that addresses the specific problem with logging instead of having to drop the whole REST API translations feature.\n\nTo recap the problem, inside python logging the Message is converted first to string then to unicode, which breaks if the message contained non-ascii characters. It is converted first to string because that is the default behavior for non-basestring classes which Message is.\n\ndhellman proposes creating a LoggerAdapter, very similar to ContextAdapter, that will unicode() the Message objects so the loggers don't deal with Messages. \n\nWe will write, test and send out a patch shortly.",
