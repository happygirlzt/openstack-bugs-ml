Turns out, we create and\n    destroy this object too often, which means we do a lot of those\n    lookups unnecessarily. That's a larger problem that will be harder\n    to solve, but we can be smarter about the DB impact of that.\n    \n    This adds a cache of the last version we discovered and avoids doing\n    the lookup when possible. It makes the reset() method invalidate the\n    cache prior to reinitializing the object so that we will do the lookup\n    on SIGHUP as desired.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1524444\n    Change-Id: Ia1c58efa7105d32973f6921c2144b17c30b764c2\n",
