That\n    ends up calling get_host_stats(refresh=True), resulting in a\n    libvirt/XenAPI/etc call.  On a build of a new instance when the instance\n    record is updated often (task_state and progress), this results in a lot\n    of unnecessary driver calls.\n    \n    This changes get_available_nodes() to take a refresh kwarg to pass\n    through to get_host_stats(), defaulting to False so that it uses\n    the cache.  Places that used get_available_nodes() and are sensitive to\n    stale data are changed to add refresh=True.  Also adds a helper driver\n    method for 'is_node_available'.  And make sure that even if drivers'\n    get_host_stats() methods get refresh=False that they refresh when they\n    have no stats.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1210264\n    \n    Change-Id: I22c8d70e3e70f2d2421915da66c2618688e0db2b\n",
