One can reproduce the very same problem in real life by running enough ceilometer polling agents.\n\nMake sure you use credentials of an admin user (e.g. admin or ceilometer in Devstack) and have at least 1 instance running (so that `nova list` triggers an HTTP request to neutron-server).\n\n1.

The \"Neutron client was not able to generate a valid admin token, please verify Neutron admin credential located in nova.conf\" error is intended to be output, and HTTP 400 raised, when the session auth is using the neutron auth parameters from nova.conf. Unfortunately this code is also being hit in one case where the session auth only has a token rather than the admin auth parameters from conf, making it unable to re-authenticate. That case is when nova.network.neutronv2.api.get_client has admin=False, context.is_admin=True, and context.auth_token is set. In that case, admin auth is not used [1] but the ClientWrapper is told that an admin context was used [2].\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/ocata/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L136\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/ocata/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L154\n",
