So I got 32 virtual functions(16 virtual function for each physical function).\nNow I want to make openstack only use the 16 virtual functions for the physical functions which is plugged in.   However, I found that only  product_id and vender_id can be the filter criteria when I looked up the code in  pci/pci_whitelist.py(Line 40,  _WHITELIST_SCHEMA).\nI hope I could filter PCI devices by physical functions like this  pci_passthrough_whitelist=[{ \"vendor_id\":\"8086\",\"product_id\":\"1515\", \"phys_function.0.3\": \"0x0\"}].\n\nThere is a same problem for the pci_alias.  I can't use extra_info to  define  the pci_alias filter(The physical function info is in extra_info)",
