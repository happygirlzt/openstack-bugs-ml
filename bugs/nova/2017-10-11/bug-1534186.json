Improving the exception information could improve user experience. Additionally I audited the unit test coverage for this method and found exception states are not directly tested (eg, what happens when an invalid IP is provided as the argument to this particular method). I would suggest the fix for this bug is 2 parts, 1) improve exception information for  remove_fixed_ip_from_instance and 2) improve unit test coverage for error states.",

I'm not sure if this is by design but in this case it means the unit test is passing even if the fixed ip removal fails. I am going to confirm this and ask that someone else who has more context take a look at it to make sure this is the intention. If dropping the exception is the intention, then at minimum a comment needs to be added to that section indicating why and also documentation updated if appropriate.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/tests/unit/network/test_neutronv2.py#L2314\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L943",

This is a async operation. For async API operations, you don't return an error code from the API if the operation fails. Hence, the API returns 202 response even if we pass a wrong IP as a argument. Also, 202 response suggests the request is accepted, it does not indicate that the response is OK. \n\nHence, marking this bug as invalid. Please feel free to reopen If I am missing something.\n ",
