You can reproduce this just by typing  \"$ nova-manage user create \"  and you should see the traceback\t\n\nAnthony Young 11:45:14 IST\nhey deepak - yes, I can reproduce this\nThe issue is that the output is unhelpful, from the looks of it\n11:46:04 IST\n \nDeepak Garg 11:47:06 IST\nk, but issuing a traceback on the terminal screen does not seem a good idea to me. I think the exception raised should be logged.\t\n\nAnthony Young 11:48:04 IST\nagreed.  but it would also be nice to know exactly which arguments are required.  Just missing params isn't really an error, imo.\nso for user create, it should have printed the help text, which should have distinguished needed from optional args.\n11:49:57 IST\nand of course, no exception \n11:50:10 IST\n \nDeepak Garg 11:50:10 IST\nk, when we do a  $ nova-manage user    , we get a list of sub-cmds that could be used.  now when we do a nova-manage user create  there are no more sub-cmds,  \nnot sure, but I  guess there is no help text for  subcmds  e.g. $ nova-manage help user create\n11:51:10 IST\n \nAnthony Young 11:53:28 IST\nI get this: http://pastie.org/3568892 - so there is some help text, but it is only marginally useful\nso it should say --name is required, and the other params are not\n11:53:50 IST\n \nDeepak Garg 11:56:47 IST\nThe issue of the keyword params being optional or not might need to be taken care of a lot of other sub-cmds. So, it may be addressed in a separate ticket.  IMO we should fix the traceback for now.  For a normal user/admin  it gives the impression as if the system has broken or something.\t\n\nAnthony Young 11:57:34 IST\nfair enough",
