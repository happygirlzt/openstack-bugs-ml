The filename for the nova-dhcpbridge configuration file is provided through an environment variable (FLAGFILE  or CONFIGFILE) when it is execute. The filename itself is specified using the dhcpbridge_flagfile in the nova configuration files, but only permits a single value. Consequently it is a.) not possible to define multiple configuration files and b.) not possible to influence this configuration over multiple configuration files.",
