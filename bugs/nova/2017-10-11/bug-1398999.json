Once we've removed the opportunity for extremely slow data corruption, then we can consider optional/possible ways to handle live migrations with volumes attached. But I think that we can demonstrate that, for now at least, the only solution that will work for everyone using libvirt is to disable these live migrations entirely.",

Block devices that are not\n    provided will not be migrated. It means that it is possible to\n    exclude volumes from block migration and therefore prevent volumes\n    from being copied to themselves.\n    \n    This patch implements new check of libvirt version. If version is\n    higher or equal to 1.2.17 it is possible to block live migrate vm\n    with attached volumes.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Bartosz Fic <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I8fcc3ef3cb5d9fd3a95067929c496fdb5976fd41\n    Closes-Bug: #1398999\n    Partially implements: blueprint block-live-migrate-with-attached-volumes\n",

However, I8fcc3ef3cb5d9fd3a95067929c496fdb5976fd41 in\n    nova says that this is possible with libvirt >= 1.2.17. Since we are\n    using libvirt 2.5.0 from the Ubuntu Cloud Archive on Xenial nodes\n    now, we should be able to enable this test.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7d7a708b231070468616ae852d81d2f8b01ba568\n    Related-Bug: #1398999\n",
