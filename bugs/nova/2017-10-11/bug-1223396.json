Those data recovery concerns don't extend to the swap device or any attached volumes - so I don't want to overly complicate a fix to the basic data loss issue by including them in the scope of any fix.\n\nIf there is a need of recovering other discs that should be addresses seperatly",

Often when a user is rescuing a VM, they expect\n    to be able to access all of their original disks so they can potentially\n    salvage data.\n    \n    This changes the xenapi driver to attach the original local disks\n    during rescue so the user can rescue all of their data.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    \n    Implements: blueprint rescue-attach-all-disks\n    Change-Id: Iba5cc85cd03d0a60f1858cf16aa31397e163df50\n    Partial-bug: 1223396\n",
