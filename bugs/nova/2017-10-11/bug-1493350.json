This causes the volume and\n    search paths to be malformed and volumes can't be found. This patch\n    adds two functions to linuxscsi.py to process the lun id's; they can\n    process both a single lun id and a list of them. If a lun id has a\n    value larger than 255 it is converted to hex. This patch also modifies\n    the necessary unit tests and adds ones to cover the new main function.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib0b2f239a8152275de9ea66fa99a286dfbe53d57\n    Closes-bug: #1493350\n",
