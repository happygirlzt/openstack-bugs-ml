Add source group as a source to the target group.\n 4. Add rules to allow ssh/ping into source group.\n 5. Now ssh into the source group and ping/ssh to target group vm using its private IP \u2013 should be successful/\n 6. Now try to ping/ssh to target group vm using its public ip \u2013 this is being successful when both the VMs are hosted onto same compute node but it is not pingable when both source and target group VMs are hosted to different compute nodes.\n\nWhich behavior is expected? Is the target group VM needs to be pingable through its floating IP from a source group VM with above configuration.\nI checked this scenario in stable diablo version and as well as folsom.",
