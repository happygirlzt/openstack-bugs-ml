Where we get architectures from external systems\n    or users, validate them against the list of acceptable names.\n    \n    The Xen hypervisor is reporting 'i686' architecture with the\n    unusual name 'x86_32' so must be converted to use the normal\n    name. Upon upgrade the existing data in the compute nodes\n    table will be upgraded by the periodic refresh of compute\n    node information.\n    \n    On the other side, the ImagePropertiesFilter will canonicalize\n    the architecture it fetches from image metadata, so that\n    'x86_32' gets remapped to 'i686' during comparison.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1348624\n    Change-Id: I1adfb0a2258a628004aaa28c1ac04c4cf3d3eea6\n",
