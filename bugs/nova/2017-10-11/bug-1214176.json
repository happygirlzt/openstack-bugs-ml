There never was a limited liability corporation setup under that name, so the fact that the copyright header ever displayed OpenStack LLC was always a bug as well as a total fallacy.  To me, this is a huge bug.  It would be a different story if we were actually protecting the IP of a real company who created the code, but in this case we would be protecting the integrity of a header that credits a fictitious limited liability corporation which does not exist and never has.\n\nPolicy or not, I honestly believe the headers should be changed to reflect an actual real entity.  OpenStack Foundation is real.  OpenStack LLC is fictitious.\n\nRegards,\n\nSean W.\n\n\nOn Sep 19, 2013, at 7:58 PM, John Griffith <email address hidden> wrote:\n\n> I'm not sure about this, typically going back and changing/modifying\n> existing copyrights isn't something that's generally acceptable.

The meta dict returned from get_info stroges special\n    chars as unicode however. So just encode it for tempurl using.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1242644\n    Change-Id: I4be62eea014a573efc4748470de57dccf00e431d\n\ncommit cd2e7df0b69bbd269cd3c4170e0fee8186a07c95\nAuthor: Pete Zaitcev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Oct 22 17:18:04 2013 -0600\n\n    Add an __str__ method to brokers\n    \n    A few uses of broker.db_file are in printouts where we do need\n    them, so the administrator may know what's up. Seems like an easy\n    way to get rid of those is to make brokers identify themselves\n    with common __str__. Alternative back-end implementations may\n    supply something other than a filename here, for example a cluster\n    name and a volume name.\n    \n    Note that I'm not sure if correct coercion would occur when\n    brokers are bounced through dictionaries, hence explicit str().\n    \n    Change-Id: I329788ebd1fbe39ffadcf9f9d5194a74a88dde58\n\ncommit 9807a358c6d1314d25e3a41da75be5851fa0ac27\nAuthor: Donagh McCabe <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Aug 23 15:03:08 2013 +0100\n\n    Add WWW-Authenticate to 401 responses\n    \n    Per http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt, when a 401 error is returned, the\n    Www-Authenticate response header MUST also be returned.

We also move the mount checking and thread pool storage\n    to the new ondisk.Devices object, which then also becomes the new home\n    of the audit_location_generator method.\n    \n    For the object server, a new setup() method is now called at the end\n    of the controller's construction, and the _diskfile() method has been\n    renamed to get_diskfile(), to allow implementation specific behavior.\n    \n    We then hide the need for the REST API layer to know how and where\n    quarantining needs to be performed. There are now two places it is\n    checked internally, on open() where we verify the content-length,\n    name, and x-timestamp metadata, and in the reader on close where the\n    etag metadata is checked if the entire file was read.\n    \n    We add a reader class to allow implementations to isolate the WSGI\n    handling code for that specific environment (it is used no-where else\n    in the REST APIs). This simplifies the caller's code to just use a\n    \"with\" statement once open to avoid multiple points where close needs\n    to be called.\n    \n    For a full historical comparison, including the usage patterns see:\n    https://gist.github.com/portante/5488238\n    \n    (as of master, 2b639f5, Merge\n     \"Fix 500 from account-quota     This Commit\n     middleware\")\n    --------------------------------+------------------------------------\n                                     DiskFileManager(conf)\n    \n                                       Methods:\n                                         .pickle_async_update()\n                                         .get_diskfile()\n                                         .get_hashes()\n    \n                                       Attributes:\n                                         .devices\n                                         .logger\n                                         .disk_chunk_size\n                                         .keep_cache_size\n                                         .bytes_per_sync\n    \n    DiskFile(a,c,o,keep_data_fp=)    DiskFile(a,c,o)\n    \n      Methods:                         Methods:\n       *.__iter__()\n        .close(verify_file=)\n        .is_deleted()\n        .is_expired()\n        .quarantine()\n        .get_data_file_size()\n                                         .open()\n                                         .read_metadata()\n        .create()                        .create()\n                                         .write_metadata()\n        .delete()                        .delete()\n    \n      Attributes:                      Attributes:\n        .quarantined_dir\n        .keep_cache\n        .metadata\n                                    *DiskFileReader()\n    \n                                       Methods:\n                                         .__iter__()\n                                         .close()\n    \n                                       Attributes:\n                                        +.was_quarantined\n    \n    DiskWriter()                     DiskFileWriter()\n    \n      Methods:                         Methods:\n        .write()                         .write()\n        .put()                           .put()\n    \n    * Note that the DiskFile class   * Note that the DiskReader() object\n      implements all the methods       returned by the\n      necessary for a WSGI app         DiskFileOpened.reader() method\n      iterator                         implements all the methods\n                                       necessary for a WSGI app iterator\n    \n                                     + Note that if the auditor is\n                                       refactored to not use the DiskFile\n                                       class, see\n                                       https://review.openstack.org/44787\n                                       then we don't need the\n                                       was_quarantined attribute\n    \n    A reference \"in-memory\" object server implementation of a backend\n    DiskFile class in swift/obj/mem_server.py and\n    swift/obj/mem_diskfile.py.\n    \n    One can also reference\n    https://github.com/portante/gluster-swift/commits/diskfile for the\n    proposed integration with the gluster-swift code based on these\n    changes.\n    \n    Change-Id: I44e153fdb405a5743e9c05349008f94136764916\n    Signed-off-by: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\n\ncommit a4e25d6da8d007051b3b0575de47338e210d4315\nAuthor: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 14 13:12:22 2013 -0700\n\n    Proxy: use just one greenthread per client\n    \n    Instead of using two greenthreads and an eventlet.queue.Queue of size\n    1 to stream response bodies from backends to clients, just do it with\n    a single greenthread that reads and writes in a loop.

In addition, the same construct was being applied to\n    the Pool.get() call in ._get_conns().\n    \n    If the maximum number of connections was already created, and the\n    Pool.get() called took longer than the connect timeout, then the error\n    handling path would add a place holder to the connection\n    pool. Eventlet's Pool class allows for additional items to be added to\n    the pool, over and above the max_size setting. This additional place\n    holder will eventually be pulled and a new connection created to take\n    its place.\n    \n    The fix is to remove the timeout construct in the _get_conns() method.\n    \n    In addition, we also apply the unit test patch mentioned in the review\n    comments for Patch Set 6 of https://review.openstack.org/45134,\n    located at http://paste.openstack.org/show/47288/.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1235027\n    \n    Change-Id: I786cabefe3e8ddf7d92feb7ebc7cfb613d60a1da\n    Signed-off-by: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\n\ncommit 9411a24ba7b5a1380ec8a2aa13d4aa92988d2ff9\nAuthor: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 7 12:10:31 2013 +0000\n\n    Revert \"Refactor common/utils methods to common/ondisk\"\n    \n    This reverts commit 7760f41c3ce436cb23b4b8425db3749a3da33d32\n    \n    Change-Id: I95e57a2563784a8cd5e995cc826afeac0eadbe62\n    Signed-off-by: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\n\ncommit 61e135e211822840731d3153e9b249b6b81a1c21\nAuthor: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sat Oct 5 11:27:35 2013 -0400\n\n    Fix bad hash_path reference\n    \n    Mea culpa: these two scripts were missed in commit:\n    \n      https://review.openstack.org/46956\n    \n    Fixes bug 1235441\n    \n    Change-Id: I4303bc808448a79bddbb991526b0cca26150b392\n    Signed-off-by: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\n\ncommit c7e65db27da59ddf221d1720362434581ef30311\nAuthor: Pete Zaitcev <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Oct 4 23:18:07 2013 -0600\n\n    Make test_translations test our tree\n    \n    In order to run the correct classes, Python test framework adjusts\n    sys.path.

As part of the teardown for this, the proxy would\n    attempt to close the connection to the object server, then drain any\n    associated buffers. However, this didn't work particularly well,\n    resulting in the proxy reading the entire remainder of the object for\n    no gain.\n    \n    Now, the proxy closes the connection hard, by calling .close() on the\n    underlying socket._socket object. This is different from calling\n    .close() on a socket._socketobject object, which is what you get back\n    from socket.socket() and similar methods. Calling .close() on a\n    socket._socketobject simply decrements a reference counter on the\n    socket._socket, which has been observed in the past to result in\n    socket leaks when something holds onto a reference. However, calling\n    .close() on a socket._socket actually closes the socket regardless of\n    who else has a reference to it.\n    \n    I had to delete a test assertion that said the object server never got\n    SIGPIPE after a GET w/X-Newest. Well, you get a SIGPIPE when you write\n    to a closed socket, and now the proxy is actually closing the sockets\n    early, so now you *do* get a SIGPIPE.\n    \n    closes-bug: 1174660\n    \n    Note that this will cause a regression on bug 1037337; unfortunately,\n    the cure is worse than the disease, so out it goes.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9c7a2e7fdb8b4232e53ea96f86b50e8d34c27221\n\ncommit 6b67952442429cff306ceefc83dd206a4a5c16ed\nAuthor: Dirk Mueller <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 2 21:27:40 2013 +0200\n\n    assertEquals is deprecated, use assertEqual\n    \n    The very same functionality for fewer keystrokes.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8c9513412f398132db5636fdfb7bf8301e8443cf\n\ncommit 02e247c1b3d9637c6d6ecfd47ce82d250c576dbb\nAuthor: Clay Gerrard <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Oct 2 11:39:35 2013 -0700\n\n    Add \"note\" box callouts to SAIO for user changes.\n    \n    The SAIO is purpously cut into two parts, so that you don't have to switch\n    back and forth between root and your unprivledged user.

This also adds a proxy config\n    \"max_memcache_connections\" which can control how many connections are\n    available in the pool.\n    \n    A side effect of the change is that we had to change the memcache calls\n    that used noreply, and instead wait for the result of the request.\n    Leaving with noreply could cause a race condition (specifically in\n    account auto create), due to one request calling `memcache.del(key)` and\n    then `memcache.get(key)` with a different pooled connection.  If the\n    delete didn't complete fast enough, the get would return the old value\n    before it was deleted, and thus believe that the account was not\n    autocreated.\n    \n    ClaysMindExploded\n    DocImpact\n    Change-Id: I350720b7bba29e1453894d3d4105ac1ea232595b\n\ncommit e8a07c4ca784f958e33044c267212925d6452979\nAuthor: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Sep 26 15:47:36 2013 -0400\n\n    Fedora 19 updates\n    \n    Change-Id: I95138852e45aa7632218a7107e0e7ba1f6ef373c\n    Signed-off-by: Peter Portante <email address hidden>\n\ncommit f9c4eb806f14ce095554d70261504781dbb7aa3e\nAuthor: Brian D.
