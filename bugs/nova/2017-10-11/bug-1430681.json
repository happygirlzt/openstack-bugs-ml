    "description": "When a value is assigned to an object field it is type checked in the coerce() method for the field and a ValueError exception is raised if it is not of the appropriate type. The name of the field involved in the check is known in the coerce() method, but in most cases it is not mentioned in the error message. When constructing an object with a list of field values it is hard to know which one caused the error. Adding the name of the field that generated the error would help.\n\nFor example, this test:\n\n    def test_my_dummy_test(self):\n        i = instance.Instance(uuid='my id', system_metadata='metadata')\n\nThis would this would result in a ValueError exception as follows:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/tests/unit/objects/test_instance.py\", line 1514, in test_my_dummy_test\n    i = instance.Instance(uuid='my id', system_metadata='metadata')\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/objects/instance.py\", line 270, in __init__\n    super(Instance, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/objects/base.py\", line 282, in __init__\n    setattr(self, key, kwargs[key])\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/objects/base.py\", line 77, in setter\n    field_value = field.coerce(self, name, value)\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/objects/fields.py\", line 191, in coerce\n    return self._type.coerce(obj, attr, value)\n  File \"/home/ptm/code/nova/nova/objects/fields.py\", line 433, in coerce\n    raise ValueError(_('A dict is required in field %s') % attr)\nValueError: A dict is required here\n\nThis does not give any clue which of the two values supplied is incorrect.

Most of the messages\n    do not indicate which field was involved although that information\n    is available in the coerce() methods. This change adds the\n    field name to the error messages.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic94d52f6019c5a5a291675e321f96f5c65beaf10\n    Closes-Bug:  #1430681\n",
