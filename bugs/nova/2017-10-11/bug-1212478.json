Let's hold off on this for now (I'll cancel) and I'm going to continue to dig into this to see what's going on, but from what I can tell as per my latest findings, the live migration code is working as it should: if the destination is passed into the conductor's live migration task, it doesn't even try to locate a new host and uses what's passed.\n\nThanks,\nJoe.",
