    "description": "Suspended instances cannot resume after hypervisor reboot using the libvirt driver.  The method to reproduce the problem is simple:\n\n1. Create a new tenant (VLAN manager network model should be configured) and launch an instance within this tenant.\n\n2. Suspend the instance.\n\n3. Reboot the hypervisor on which the suspended instance rests.  Assume for the sake of discussion it comes back up without a problem and restarts the compute service.\n\n4. Resume the instance.  It will fail.\n\nThe reason it fails is that we're expecting the physical system to be in a state which it is not.  The networking is not in place (bridge, VLAN, iptables rules, etc.), nor are any block device connections.  The resume() method calls _create_domain(), which will not rebuild any of these dependencies.  We should call _create_domain_and_network() instead, so that we eliminate any assumptions about the state of the hypervisor.",

This eliminates the assumption that the\n    network and block device connections remained in place from the period\n    between the VM being suspended and resumed.  Instead, all the\n    networking and block connections will be rebuilt on resume (in case\n    they are missing) as is the case after a hypervisor reboot.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6e19ec42f7e929678abce8f276c0a6e91f1fa8af\n",

This actually is a problem because security group rules don't get recreated on reboot. So basically doing a suspend / reboot host /resume means you could have an instance without security group rules.",
