Basically we have lots of places we make HTTP calls to other services and they are all very inconsistent in how they retry, what happens when they fail, etc.  Would be good to unify that.  Happy to turn this into a blueprint (or just drop it) if that's better.\n\nBrian W: it is referring to that and the http connections around it.",
