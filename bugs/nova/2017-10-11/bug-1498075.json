This\n    patch allows leading/trailing spaces but will strip them, and still\n    disallows that all characters are spaces in the name fields for\n    flavor_mange, servers, aggregates(and availability_zones),\n    create_backup, create_image, rebuild.\n    \n    Due to the server_groups and security_groups(no jsons-schema in v2.1)\n    have consistent behavior between v2 and v2.1. So this patch won't\n    change server_groups.\n    \n    But when creating servers, the name of security_groups, availability_zone\n    and keyapir isn't stripped the leading/trailing spaces. This is for\n    backward compatible with users who already use legacy V2 API created\n    security_group, availabilit_zone and keypair with leading/trailing\n    in the name, otherwise the users can't use those resource anymore.\n    \n    For supporting servers schema extension point returns legacy v2 schema,\n    this patch adds version parameter to the schema extension point. Then\n    extension point can return different schema based on the version\n    parameter.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9442891272284d395ea0dd8cfa302d3f74bf13ec\n    Partial-Bug: #1498075\n",
