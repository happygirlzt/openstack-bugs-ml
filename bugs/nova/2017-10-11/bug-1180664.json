I'm going to move it to \"Opinion / Wishlist\", which is an easily-obtainable queue of older requests that have come on. This bug can be reopened (set back to \"New\") if someone decides to work on this.\n\nNOTE:\nChanging the vcpu, memory or disk of a flavor has a big impact. Imagine an OpenStack cloud where 1000 instances were launched with example flavor \"A\" (1 VCPU, 1GB memory). After that, we change this specific flavor \"A\" by increasing the amount of VCPUs from 1 to 2. This means all 1000 instances would need to be rebuild with 2 VCPUs. I doubt that this is the desired use case. To be honest, I don't understand the use case described in comment #2. \nNevertheless, Feature requests for nova are done with blueprints [1] and with specs [2]. I'll recommend to read [3] if not yet done. The effort to implement the requestedfeature is then driven only by the blueprint (and spec).\n\nIf there are any questions left, feel free to contact me (markus_z)\nin the IRC channel #openstack-nova\n\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
