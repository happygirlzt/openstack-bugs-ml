This results in the command getting started with its output, but then saying \"Wrong number of arguments supplied\":\n\nxenapi $ bin/nova-manage vpn list\nproject         ip:port                 state\nuser            10.0.0.1:1000      Wrong number of arguments supplied\nvpn list: Print a listing of the VPNs for all projects.\n\nThis is because nova-manage is wrapped in an except block that rather horribly treats all TypeErrors as if the user has supplied the wrong arguments.",
