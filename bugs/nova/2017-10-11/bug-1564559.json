    "description": "When migrating instances should not have affinity with themselves.\n\nThis is most clearly seen with hard anti-affinity as an instance attempting to migrate to the same host would be unable to do so due to the presence of 'itself' on the host. (See bug #1558532).\n\nIn the soft-affinity case the consequences are not so dire, but can lead to incorrect weights being calculated. This is due to the fact that the soft affinity weigher counts the instance that is being migrated when looking at the number of instances from the group on a host.\n\nSee: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/scheduler/weights/affinity.py#L49",
