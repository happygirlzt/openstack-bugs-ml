            "content": "@jaypipes:\n\nThanks for the link. I took a look at it, and it doesn't seem to me that it's intended for this purpose. To configure trunk port and its sub interfaces require clear identification of parent-subport relationship that tagging won't be able to adequately support.\n\nA simple idea is to populate the network_data.json file in the configdrive based on the trunk_details in trunk ports. For example, the following network_data.json file contains one trunk port with three sub interfaces.\n\nnetwork_data.json file\n\nservices\": [],\n\"networks\": [\n    {\n        \"network_id\": \"9f1c0636-ba1f-42fd-a741-a2d0194704b5\",\n        \"link\": \"tapad7e2436-35\",\n        \"type\": \"ipv4_dhcp\",\n        \"id\": \"network0\"\n    },\n    {\n          \"network_id\": \"ea077fad-e52a-4fa1-952f-06110e436d7d\",\n          \"link\": \"tap143d8632-e3\",\n          \"type\": \"ipv4_dhcp\",\n          \"id\": \"network1\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"network_id\": \"bbd6f034-a600-46c1-b22f-0502697e179e\",\n        \"link\": \"tap4bc16b9c-e2\",\n        \"type\": \"ipv4_dhcp\",\n        \"id\": \"network2\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"network_id\": \"0597cc43-7a2f-4ac0-847e-d9639d83fb6e\",\n        \"link\": \"tap9189504d-42\",\n        \"type\": \"ipv4_dhcp\",\n        \"id\": \"network3\"\n    }\n],\n\"links\": [\n    { // trunk\n        \"ethernet_mac_address\": \"fa:16:3e:54:2e:51\",\n        \"mtu\": 1500,\n        \"type\": \"ovs\",\n        \"id\": \"tapad7e2436-35\",\n        \"vif_id\": \"ad7e2436-3583-4ae3-844b-06e6b0adaf04\"\n    },\n    { // sub interface\n        \"vif_id\": \"143d8632-e320-4fdb-aa07-bf2767085efd\",\n        \"mtu\": 1500,\n        \"vlan_link\": \"tapad7e2436-35\",\n        \"vlan_id\": 3279,\n        \"type\": \"vlan\",\n        \"id\": \"tap143d8632-e3\",\n        \"vlan_mac_address\": \"fa:16:3e:8e:b4:99\"\n    },\n    { // sub interface\n        \"vif_id\": \"4bc16b9c-e2b6-4c09-ba98-e94160cce12d\",\n        \"mtu\": 1500,\n        \"vlan_link\":\"tapad7e2436-35\",\n        \"vlan_id\": 3274,\n        \"type\": \"vlan\",\n        \"id\": \"tap4bc16b9c-e2\",\n        \"vlan_mac_address\": \"fa:16:3e:a4:93:98\"\n    },\n    { // sub interface\n        \"vif_id\": \"9189504d-4251-46ea-a676-2573b4e14580\",\n        \"mtu\": 1500,\n        \"vlan_link\": \"tapad7e2436-35\",\n        \"vlan_id\": 3272,\n        \"type\": \"vlan\",\n        \"id\": \"tap9189504d-42\",\n        \"vlan_mac_address\": \"fa:16:3e:72:d5:33\"\n    }\n]\n}\n\nThe network_data.json file is currently supported by cloud-init (and glean).
