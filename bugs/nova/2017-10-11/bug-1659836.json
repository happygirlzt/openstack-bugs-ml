    "description": "When a node is unprovisioned with cleaning enabled it moves into the\nCLEANING state which exclusively locks the node.\n\nA node will remain in CLEANING state and therefore locked until the node\nmoves into the CLEAN_WAIT state, this can take as long as it takes to\ndecommission the node and power it back on for booting the cleaning\nramdisk. This can take a surprisingly long amount of time with real\nhardware.\n\nThere are several tasks that require a lock on the Ironic node,\nwhich it can't claim if the node is already exclusively locked by being\nin the CLEANING state.\n\nThis means that people deploying nova have to tune their nova timeouts and retries to match their equipment, to ensure that nova keeps retrying until that node becomes unlocked. This can slow down the turn around time of Ironic nodes and confuses users wondering why their node is taking so much time to delete.",
