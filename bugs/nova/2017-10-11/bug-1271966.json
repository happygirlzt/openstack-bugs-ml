    "description": "The behaviour of spawn() in the vmwareapi driver wrt images and block device mappings is currently as follows:\n\nIf there are any block device mappings, images are ignored\nIf there are any block device mappings, the last becomes the root device and all others are ignored\n\nThis means that, for example, the following scenarios are not possible:\n\n1. Spawn an instance with a root device from an image, and a secondary volume\n2. Spawn an instance with a volume as a root device, and a secondary volume\n\nThe behaviour of the libvirt driver is as follows:\n\nIf there is an image, it will be the root device unless there is also a block device mapping for the root device\nAll block device mappings are used\nIf there are multiple block device mappings for the same device, the last one is used\n\nThe vmwareapi driver's behaviour is surprising, and should be modified to follow the libvirt driver.",

This is incorrect\n    and is a bug in the VMware driver, since the block devices\n    can be blank volumes.  We should be able to accept an image\n    and block device mappings in \"nova boot\".\n    \n    DocImpact: VMware supports nova boot with the --block-device\n    option.  End users can specify the block device's bus to be\n    either lsiLogic, busLogic, ide, lsiLogicsas, or paraVirtual.\n    For example, nova boot --flavor m1.tiny --block-device\n    source=image,dest=volume,size=1,id=<image_id>,bus=lsiLogicsas,\n    bootindex=0 test\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibf59906b95bda560d2427c88a78b65c098825959\n    Closes-Bug: #1350224\n    Closes-Bug: #1271966\n",
