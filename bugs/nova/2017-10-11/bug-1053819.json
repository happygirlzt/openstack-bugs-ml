            "content": "Yes, all parts of nova assumes that IPs can never overlap.  This is similar to the issues with nova-metadata server and overlapping IPs.  \n\nDuring Folsom we had wanted to get security groups ported over to Quantum, which would have meant that we add support for overlapping IPs as well as multiple interface per VM.  However, we ran out of time, and so we have the partial solution of utilizing Nova security groups, with those limits.  Not great, I agree.  \n\nTo me, the real concern here is that there is no good way to make sure nova metadata & security groups are only used if Quantum has no overlapping IPs.  One thing we had discussed was potentially having a flag in Quantum that indicates whether overlapping IPs should be allowed or not.  We could default this to false, and then mention the limitations around metadata + security groups where we document how to enable overlapping IPs in Quantum.  The concern I have with this approach is that defaulting to not allowing overlapping IPs seems like the wrong long-term default for quantum, once quantum itself implements security groups (and we modify the metadata mechanism to handle overlapping IPs).  Outside of that, I think this is just a question of documentation, unless someone else sees anything super bright.  \n\n",

We could do something similar for the BridgeDriver to support Linux Bridge plugin.  \n- modify nova/virt/firewall.py, and create a NamespaceIPtablesFirewallDriver.  This driver would be a \"meta driver\", creating a separate instance of the normal IPtablesFirewallDriver for each namespace. \n- when an instance id destroyed, destroy the instance of IPtablesFirewallDriver for that instance/vif.\n- when a vif is unplugged(), destroy the corresponding namespace. \n\n",
