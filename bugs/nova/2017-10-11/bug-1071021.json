In this case, if the instance is still running, we don't want to put it in an ERROR state.  We just need a way to report that the particular operation did not happen properly.  For the solution in progress to that , see #2.\n\nIn this particular case, it does look like the instance fault is logged in the database.  That should show up when requesting instance details via the API.\n\n2) Longer term, this feature will make non-fatal error reporting much better:\n\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/instance-actions",
