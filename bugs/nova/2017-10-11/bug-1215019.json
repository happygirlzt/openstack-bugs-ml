The stderr results should be logged at warning instead.\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/blockdev.py#L563\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/blockdev.py#L580\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/operator.py#L694\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/operator.py#L711",
