If no DNS is specified for the network, the template creates a line containing just:\n\ndns-nameservers\n\nThis is invalid and causes ifup to fail with 'couldn't read interfaces file', but you don't necessarily get to see that on the console so it can be tricky to diagnose.  Found in lp:~citrix-openstack/nova/xenapi-glance-2:542 but probably present since inception.",
