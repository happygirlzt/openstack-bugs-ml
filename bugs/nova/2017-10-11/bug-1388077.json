    "description": "Environment: OpenStack Juno release/Ubuntu 14.04/480 compute nodes/8 cloud controllers/40,000 instances +\n\nThe change made in:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/baabab45e0ae0e9e35872cae77eb04bdb5ee0545\n\nswitches power state reporting from being a serial process for each instance on a hypervisor to being a parallel thread for every instance; for clouds running high instance counts, this has quite an impact on the conductor processes as they try to deal with N instance refresh calls in parallel where N is the number of instances running on the cloud.\n\nIt might be better to throttle this to a configurable parallel level so that period RPC load can be managed effectively in a larger cloud, or to continue todo this process in series but outside of the main thread.\n\nThe net result of this activity is that it places increase demands on the message broker, which has to deal with more parallel connections, and the conductors as they try to consume all of the RPC requests; if the message broker hits its memory high water mark it will stop publishers publishing any more messages until the memory usage drops below the high water mark again - this might not be achievable if all conductor processes are tied up with existing RPC calls try to send replies, resulting in a message broker lockup and collapse of all RPC in the cloud.",
