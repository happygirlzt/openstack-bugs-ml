This changes\n    to stub out the coverage class with a fake one so that we don't have\n    to worry about collisions. It also modifies the coverage class to be\n    created lazily so it isn't automatically started at import time.\n    Finally it removes the hack in run_tests.sh ignoring the coverage\n    tests.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1131023\n    \n    Change-Id: I39de434454f8b0903f6311e731e215a93027bc91\n",
