If it is, do nothing.  If it is not there, inject a bunch of stuff (files, network data, etc)\nunmount disk\n\nProblems:\n\n1) _mount_filesystem() doesn't include 'ext4' as an option... which my image uses.. which is why the mount fails.\n2) If I were to add 'ext4', I'm going to guess nova will stomp on the work that the unix guest agent (nova-agent) will do (or the reverse of this, I guess it would be)\n\nPossible solutions:\n1) Add 'ext4' (and 'reiserfs?) to _mount_filesystem()... and check for presence of 'nova-agent' and not 'xe-daemon'?\n\nor:\n\n2) We should remove the call to 'preconfigure_instance' all-together and make nova-agent required?  nova-agent supports a wider set of OSes...   We likely wouldn't want to try to mount a FreeBSD partition in Linux for instance.",
