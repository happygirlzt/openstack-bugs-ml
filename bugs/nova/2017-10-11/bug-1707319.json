So, when you create the port, you have to specify the groups it could be applying, right?\n\nIn that case, it's your responsibility to define security groups at the port creation, not when you ask to create the VM.\n\nSee https://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/networking/services-security-best-practices.html for the security groups best practices, it clearly states that Nova should only provide a proxy API for Neutron-based SGs.\n\nI'm closing the bug as invalid as I don't think Nova should update security groups for pre-existing ports. That said, I think it would be a nice user experience to get a HTTP400 when you pass both flags at the nova boot request (an existing port ID and security group IDs) as that situation can confuse people (and me first)",

Nova wants to move away from orchestration and proxy work with external services, so adding that in would be unwanted complication.\n\nAs Sylvain pointed out, it would probably be better if Nova returned a 400 to the user if they requested specific security groups with pre-existing ports, but even that gets messy because you can create a server with both pre-existing ports and networks, and nova would update the pre-existing ports to bind them to the compute host and instance, but also create ports on the requested networks.\n\nPlus if we started returning a 400 that could break existing application code (which is arguably really already broken, but this would make it explicit).\n\nI think for now we can document this behavior in the API reference as a start.",
