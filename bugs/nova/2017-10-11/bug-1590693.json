    "description": "The nova.virt.driver 'interface' defines a get_instance_disk_info method, which is called by compute manager to get disk info during live migration to get the source hypervisor's internal representation of disk info and pass it directly to the target hypervisor over rpc. To compute manager this is an opaque blob of stuff which only the driver understands, which is presumably why json was chosen. There are a couple of problems with it.\n\nThis is a useful method within the libvirt driver, which uses it fairly liberally. However, the method returns a json blob. Every use of it internal to the libvirt driver first json encodes it in get_instance_disk_info, then immediately decodes it again, which is inefficient... except 2 uses of it in migrate_disk_and_power_off and check_can_live_migrate_source, which don't decode it and assume it's a dict. These are both broken, which presumably means something relating to migration of volume-backed instances is broken. The libvirt driver should not use this internally. We can have a wrapper method to do the json encoding for compute manager, and internally use the unencoded data data directly.\n\nSecondly, we're passing an unversioned blob of data over rpc. We should probably turn this data into a versioned object.",
