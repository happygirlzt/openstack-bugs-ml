If you force the evacuate to a specific host, we bypass some code in the nova-api and nova-conductor services and call directly into the compute on the target host and hit this code which makes it so we don't do a resource claim (which sets up the pci mappings on the instance.migration_context as part of the move claim):\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py#L2767-L2771\n\nThat ^ code is really there for rebuild operations where we don't need a resource claim because we've already claimed resources on the original host, but it got confused with this forced evacuate to a target host scenario, and we never end up claiming resources on the target host.\n\nI think all we have to do is modify that conditional to be:\n\nif scheduled_node is not None or recreate:",

I57233259065d887b38a79850a05177fcbbdfb8c3 changed some tests in\n   test_compute_manager in Ocata, but is irrelevant here.\n3. The bigger change isn't a merge conflict but in Ocata the compute\n   manager code was all refactored so that the _get_resource_tracker\n   method no longer needed a nodename passed to it. In Newton, however,\n   if we're force evacuating (scenario 3) then we don't have a scheduled_node\n   passed to the rebuild_instance method and in this case we need to\n   lookup the nodename for the host we're currently on. To resolve this,\n   some existing code that handles this case is moved up where it is\n   needed to get the resource tracker so we can get the rebuild_claim method.\n   We let any ComputeHostNotFound exception raise up in this case rather than\n   log it because without the compute node we can't make the rebuild claim and\n   we need to fail. Tests are adjusted accordingly for this.\n4. The fake instances in Mitaka are still created manually, so node\n   field needs to be added explicitly.\n\nChange-Id: I53bdcf8edf640e97b4632ef7a093f14a6e3845e4\nCloses-Bug: 1658070\n(cherry picked from commit a2b0824aca5cb4a2ae579f625327c51ed0414d35)\n(cherry picked from commit ea90c60b07534a46541c55432389f2d50b5b7d0a)\n(cherry picked from commit 0f2d87416eff1e96c0fbf0f4b08bf6b6b22246d5)\n",
