Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Oct 27 11:30:24 2014 +0000\n\n    libvirt: set NUMA memory allocation policy for instances\n    \n    When NUMA placement is in effect, Nova configures KVM guest vCPUs\n    to be placed on certain host NUMA nodes. It also provides guest\n    NUMA topology of vCPUs and RAM. The kernel will normally satisfy\n    memory allocations from the host NUMA node that the guest vCPU\n    is running on, but this is only a preference. Nova needs to set\n    a strict policy to guarantee guest RAM is always allocated from\n    the desired host NUMA node. This change ensures that by setting\n    the XML\n    \n      <numatune>\n        <memory mode='strict' nodeset='0-1'/>\n        <memnode cellid='0' mode='strict' nodeset='0'/>\n        <memnode cellid='1' mode='strict' nodeset='1'/>\n      </numatune>\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1385308\n    Change-Id: I02c301ae648235dc48527559a5d3c3d45de859ac\n",
