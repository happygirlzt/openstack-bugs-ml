The change to use Instance.create() in\n    child cells broke things.  The instance properties was being overwritten\n    due to a typo.  I also found a number of other things that need to be\n    popped out before passing to create_db_entry_for_new_instance().\n    \n    2) Notification to the API cell was failing.  We cannot pass an object to\n    instance_update_at_top().\n    \n    3) When cells is enabled, deleting an instance hits the '_local_delete'\n    part of code in the API because we don't see the compute node.  There's\n    a trap in cells_api.py to forward the delete on to child cells, but we\n    need to make sure not to try to deallocate network in the API cell.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1216113\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie989c22cb3b6a1359a0540e60e06fa4153e93476\n",
