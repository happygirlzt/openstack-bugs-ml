    "description": "Deleting an instance in 'resized' state fails with UnexpectedTaskStateError.\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Resize an  instance - Instance goes to 'resized' state\n2. Delete the instance\n\nThe failure occurs because the delete method sets the task_state to 'deleting' and then tries to do a confirm_resize on the instance. Here, the task state check fails. (Expected task state is None, but actually is in 'deleting' state)",
