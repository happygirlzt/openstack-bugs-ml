    "description": "The Kilo web socket proxy implementation for Nova consoles added an Origin header validation to ensure the Origin hostname matches the hostname from the Host header.  This was a result of the following XSS security bug:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1409142 (CVE-2015-0259)\n\nIn other words, this requires that the web UI being used (Horizon, or whatever) having a URL hostname which is the same as the hostname by which the console proxy is accessed.  This is a safe assumption for Horizon.  However, we have a use case where our (custom) UI runs at a different URL than does the console proxies, and thus we need to allow cross-site web socket connections.  The patch for 1409142 (https://github.secureserver.net/cloudplatform/els-nova/commit/fdb73a2d445971c6158a80692c6f74094fd4193a) breaks this functionality for us.\n\nWould like to have some way to enable controlled XSS web socket connections to the console proxy services, maybe via a nova config parameter providing a list of allowed origin hosts?",
