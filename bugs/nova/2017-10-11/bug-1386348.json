Really, from my perspective part of the fun with Gentoo is figuring out all these neat little things you have to do manually, it kinda goes with the territory.\n\nMy vote would be that this would be something added as a doc somewhere (not necessarily in openstack docs depending on peoples opinion about Gentoo being a supported platform), but maybe a wiki?\n\nI wouldn't want to see this added to the code base anywhere I don't think; but to be completely honest I haven't deciphered exactly what the attached script is doing to see if there's some way to boil it down to something really simple that we could easily abstract and automate in Nova.",

            "content": "Hi John,\n\nthanks for reply.\n\nI think that there isn't a simple solution that could be managed directly in Nova and probably a script to use with udev could be a valid and fast solution to catch correctly availability of scsi disk. Obviously, all steps do inside scsi-openscsi-link.sh could be integrated inside volume.py module but I don't know if this could be correct. Creation of udev symlink is a process related with os configuration and create a software that analyse disk availability with different processes in different os could produce a complex code for a fake issue.\n\nI hope that this information at least will be added on openstack docs , why doesn't permit use of Openstack everywhere ? :)\n\nI can give my availability to write a few description of the issue and how to resolve it in a wiky page if everyone agrees.\n\nAbout script... it only a script that try to retrive information about target_portal, target_iqn and target_lun of the attached disk and return name of the symlink used by udev daemon to create a correctly filename under /dev/disk/by-path directory that is used inside method _get_host_device of virt/libvirt/volume.py file to identify when disk is ready for vm.\n\nI'm waiting for a vote by nova team's members.\n\nThanks at all.\n",
