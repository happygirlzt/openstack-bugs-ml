It requires that ironic ports are tagged with the name of the 'physical_network' to which they are attached. The name maps directly to neutron's 'provider:physical_network' network property. The tag is added as a key/value in the ironic ports' 'extra' metadata.\n\nThe nova patch requires some further work before submission as it is a little hairy in places. In particular, the return value for macs_for_instance really deserves it's own type, representing the physical ports. Perhaps this would actually be better as a new method entirely as the name no longer fully describes the method.",
