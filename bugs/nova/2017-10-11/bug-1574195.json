But ovmf package will been saved in correct folder after wily version. In fact, I don't know why files will been saved there in trusty version.\nYou can check following two links, first is ovmf package files for trusty version, and second is ovmf package files for wily version.\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/ovmf/filelist\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/all/ovmf/filelist\n\nSecond, libvirt had backport fix since 1.2.19 version. Therefore trusty and wily version still not fix that. I had verify package files in following link.\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libvirt-bin\n\nI know I can just copy files to fixed first reason.\nAnd reassigned to libvirt ubuntu so they can backport fix will be great solution.\nBut I don't know how to send backport fix request to ubuntu and whether fix patch will been merged, therefore I just commit this is work around patch.\nYes, not really important work around patch.....\nAt last, I just curious about why /usr/share/OVMF will be standard location.\n",
