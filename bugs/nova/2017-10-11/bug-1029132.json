Mitchell <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jul 25 17:27:57 2012 -0500\n\n    Allow soft deletes from any state\n    \n    At some point in the past, the compute manager's delete() method had\n    its @check_instance_state() decorator updated to allow deletes to be\n    performed from any combination of vm_state and task_state.  This same\n    change was not made to the soft_delete() method, and so soft_delete()\n    is only available if the task_state is clear, meaning that instances\n    that are put into ERROR state with task_state set to something are\n    effectively undeletable, if FLAGS.reclaim_instance_interval is set to\n    some non-zero value (which is what causes the API DELETE call to use\n    soft_delete() as opposed to delete()).  This patch updates the\n    @check_instance_state() on soft_delete() to match that on delete(),\n    and fixes bug 1029130 and bug 1029133.  This patch also partially\n    fixes bug 1029132, but more needs to be done to completely fix that\n    bug.\n    \n    Change-Id: I78878110c696280f2bc28434433814884a526264\n",

This can make that instance undeletable,\n    since the first step in soft_delete() is to power_off the instance,\n    and nothing catches the NotFound error thrown if the instance doesn't\n    exist.  The libvirt support handles the case of a non-existant\n    instance by ignoring NotFound--after all, a non-existant instance is,\n    by definition, powered off, right?\n    \n    Fixes bug 1029132.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5bffe3b61fe92fc32fb70cab941fa5ecd250df77\n",
