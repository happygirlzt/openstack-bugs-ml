However, eventlet.wsgi.server() has url_length_limit=8192 as a default argument.  (Since it was coupled with bug 1054501, it was not obvious from the server side what was going on, but the client was returning HTTP Error 414).\n\nHere's a simple fix against master.\n\n(edited to include a better patch):\nhttps://github.com/holzman/nova/commit/bc05982a2691108a421594bde81ff3d16d8fedbe",

It also supports\n    user-data of 16k -- meaning that client tools could generate 16k URIs.\n    The WSGI default limit is 8k; this raises it.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1098646.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idec460d88b2affab970c9d9f39fa61295db035c5\n",
