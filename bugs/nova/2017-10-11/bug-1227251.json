This is a poor\n    assumption to make.  The object should explicitly ask for info_cache and\n    security_groups to be included in the DB object when necessary.\n    \n    Also, we should actually fix sqlalchemy api to not join these always, but\n    that's probably too large of a change right now.  Instead, make sure we\n    don't ask to join them twice in the same query.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1227251\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib39a3d041904fb5ecebbe152f2fede135a0cdb6f\n",
