If I copy/create the necessary files from /etc/keystone to /usr/share/keystone it appears to be happy then.\n\nAgain, not sure if this should indeed be working out of the /etc/keystone directory and is a bug or if the implementation changed in this release and the documentation is lagging behind.",
