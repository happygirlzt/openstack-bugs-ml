    "description": "I am using OpenStack - Grizzly.\nI have 100 vLANs in my OpenStack setup. I have created 100 Tenant/Projects and when I created VM instances each in all 100 Tenants, the vLANs were automatically assigned to Tenants.\nThat means when I create an instance in a tenant , a vLAN is automatically assigned to that tenant.\nSo, my all 100 vLANs are mapped to 100 Tenants.\n\nbut, when I delete the VM instance and the respective Tenant, its vLAN didn't get released automatically.\nand now if I try to create any new tenant and try to create an instance in that tenant, instance cannot be create and got stuck at 'scheduling' state.\nWhen I check the nova-compute log files, I found the error \"RemoteError: Remote error: NoMoreNetworks An unknown exception occurred.\"\nSo, when I checked the nova network-list using 'nova-manage network list' ,  I got the list of all the Fixed-Networks (vLANs) with their associated Tenants.\nI found that my deleted tenant's Tenant-ID is still associated with its vLAN.\n\nSo, what happens is when we delete any tenant, its associated vLAN didn't get released automatically, and vLAN contains the entry of invalid and non-existing tenant.\nHence, those vLANs are neither occupied nor available for other tenants. So, we need to disassociate those vLANs manually using CLI.\nOpenStack must provide a way to disassociate the vLANs with tenants automatically when their tenants are deleted.",
