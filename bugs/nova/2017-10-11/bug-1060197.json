During\n    Folsom development I added versioning to all rpc APIs with the exception\n    of network and volume.  I was holding off on those to see what the fate\n    of that code in nova was going to be for sure.  Adding it to the volume\n    API in nova doesn't make much sense at this point (but doing it in\n    Cinder does).  Since nova-network is sticking around for a while, it\n    seems worthwhile to add a version number to the API for any future\n    changes while the code is still in the tree.\n    \n    There are plenty of things in this rpc API that could be cleaned up or\n    improved, but I held off on doing any of those things.  I would\n    recommend the same for anyone else (unless it's a bug that needs to be\n    fixed).  I think any further improvements should be focused on Quantum\n    integration with Nova or Quantum itself.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1060197.\n    \n    Change-Id: I63ce57657388166544202af9c44c2298ae551aea\n",
