Some functional tests for traits, though, were failing because standard traits were not found in the DB. Traits have a flag so that standard traits from the os_traits library are only loaded once at startup. So the problem is that one test would use the fixture, loading the standard traits, and then clean up by removing the db entries. The next test would use the fixture, but since the flag had been set by the first test, the standard traits were not re-loaded, causing failures.",

The cause was that there is a flag that ensures that these\n    standard traits are only loaded once from the os_traits module to the\n    DB. The test fixtures, though, would clean up the DB between runs, and\n    the traits would never be re-loaded. This patch fixes that by directly\n    resetting this flag in the base test code.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1701035\n    \n    Change-Id: I5dc0220310986c5b9fe5b71013c573c3d98cb9aa\n",
