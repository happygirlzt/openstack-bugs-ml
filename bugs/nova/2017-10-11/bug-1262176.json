This is most definitely a feature request IMO, and it has almost nothing to do with Cinder.  As per my comments in the review:\n\n\"If there's real value in emulating this, then I think this needs to include the work to provide the option on create as well as provide it in the get. However, there's only ONE option that I'm aware of in EBS today, so this should filter out anything that isn't that IO1 type.\nIn other words, if an admin creates a type with this name, fine... we can expose it and allow it to be selected for creation. But we shouldn't expose any of the other types and we most certainly should not require this type exist or be built by default.\"",
