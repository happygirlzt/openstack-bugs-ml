This is curiously the same as the nbd15 device mentioned. \n\nAlthough I can't give you a fix because I don't know, well, a lot... :) but I can throw out some suggestions/questions:\n\n1) How many VMs / disks do you have running right now? (it looks like only about 7?)\n\n2) qemu-nbd, while in use, should put a pid file in /sys/block/nbdX/, so can you see if all of your /sys/block/nbdX/pid files exist? Something like `find /sys/block/nbd*/ -maxdepth 1 | grep pid` might work.\n\n3) One work-around for you, while this is looked at is to try and increase the number of NBD's on your system. The only way I know of is to do a `modprobe -r nbd` and then `modprobe nbd nbds_max=32` (or some higher number). NOTE: I have absolutely no idea what this will do to all of your disks. You'd also have to increase the --max_nbd_devices flag to 32 in /etc/nova.conf.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
