Both paths are going to eventually call check_can_live_migrate_destination on the destination compute host so we could create the allocation there, although that gets tricky since it could overwrite any allocations that the scheduler created via select_destinations if a host isn't forced.\n\n2. Just call placement from conductor when a host isn't forced, somewhere in this else block:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/16.0.0.0rc1/nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py#L56\n\nThat's probably the cleanest since it wouldn't overwrite any allocations by the scheduler, since the scheduler isn't called, and it would actually make the destination host allocations correct before the RT could heal them, assuming not all compute nodes are upgraded yet.",
