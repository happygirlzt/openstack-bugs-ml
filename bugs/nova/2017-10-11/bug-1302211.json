I'm assuming the tests originated\n    in Qcow2TestCase but later more image types were added and the\n    tests were pulled up into the common parent mixin since they\n    applied to all types of images, but the redundant tests from\n    Qcow2TestCase weren't cleaned up.\n    \n    Related-Bug: #1302211\n    \n    Change-Id: I031516b555ead5a3769fb62d90e373aac1b6baf1\n",
