The large number of updated_at instances could happen organically, but in our case was triggered by the _run_pending_deletes compute periodic task updating a large number of instances.",

This adds pagination\n    to the generator used in order to limit it, and an optional parameter to\n    optimize for when small numbers of instances are needed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia82185af27ed11d68a8498ec4bde3da529134893\n    Closes-Bug: 1447732\n",
