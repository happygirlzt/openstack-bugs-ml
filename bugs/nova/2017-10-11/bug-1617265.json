    "description": "Currently QoS can be applied on instances with nova flavors[1]. But, it will not get applied if user is booting instance from image to volume bdm.\n  \nFor cinder volumes, qos specs can be associated with specified volume type after setting qos by \"cinder qos-create\" which can be attached to the instance[2].\n\nBut incase of multiple volume types it's not possible to provide the specific volume_type during instance boot from image to volume.\n\nVolume_type name can be mentioned in \"cinder.conf\" with 'default_volume_type' parameter incase of single volume_type.\n\nWith this 'default_volume_type' option, if you create new instance from image to volume bdm, volume will get created with provided volume type where QoS is set.\n\nBut, if there are multiple volume types then \"default_volume_type\" option is not valid.\n\nSo, for cinder volumes, 2 steps needs to be performed,\n1. create volume with qos using cinder.\n2. boot from volume using nova.\n\n\nCan we reduce it to single step ? May be by:\n\n1.  providing option to select volume type while booting new instance from volume.\nOr\n2. Applying QoS defined in nova flavors to cinder volumes.\n\n\n\n\n[1] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/InstanceResourceQuota\n[2] http://paste.openstack.org/show/563825/",
