    "description": "While booting an instance with block device mappings, certain scenarios need to be \ntaken care of in the Compute API so that Invalid user inputs are avoided and instances do not \nland up in inconsistent states. \nWe need to add validations in the API to ensure the request body contain correct combinations\nof num_instances and block_device_mappings.\n\nFor example:\n1. Boot multiple instances using a single block device mapping. \nCurrent behavior: Only one instance boots successfully with the volume attached to it.\nThe other instances fail block device mapping and land up in ERROR state as the volume is \"in-use\".\nUser needs to cleanup ERROR instances.\nAPI Response: 202 Accepted\n\nExpected behavior: API should not allow multiple instances to boot from same volume. \n\n2. Boot multiple instances from a list of block device mappings (snapshots or volumes):\nCurrent behavior: Only one instance boots successfully. Only the second volume in list gets attached to the instance (first one) on vda.\nThe other instances fail block device mapping and land up in ERROR state as the volume is \"in-use\".\nNo 1:1 mapping between volume list and instance list\nUser needs to cleanup ERROR instances.\nAPI Response: 202 Accepted\nExpected behavior: API should not allow multiple instances to boot from a list of BDMs \n\n\nThis was discussed on the mailing list and a need for appropriate API level validations was accepted.\nhttp://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2012-December/004149.html",
