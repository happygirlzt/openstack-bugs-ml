The elevated context just has the admin flag set, the request / user / project IDs in the context are left unchanged, which is what we want for logging.  And the context is already in scope because of:\n\nhttp://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/oslo.context/tree/oslo_context/context.py#n71\n\nSo we don't need to pass it as a kwarg.\n\nThis bug is meant to scrub through nova and remove any unnecessary passing of the context object to oslo.log methods.",
