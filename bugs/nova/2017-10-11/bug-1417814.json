That\u2019s what I thought, and I tried that username, but I keep getting \u201cPermission denied\u201d when I try to ssh to a new instance.\n\nI tried to start a new instance with Unbuntu 12.04 to see if that might work for me.  I used the same key-pair that I had been using for my RHEL 6.6 instances, and I got the same error message (Permission denied).\n\nI used the \u2013vvv option every time I was unable to login to each instance.  It never showed any hint of why the permission was denied.\n\nThis is all of the information that I was provided except for the tests that succeeded and failed...\n\nThe Best!\n\nBruce",
