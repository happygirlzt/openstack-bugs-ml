The relative\n    cpu allocation doesn't prevent that a container can use all CPUs but it\n    can at least ensure that a container with more CPUs gets more CPU\n    cycles.\n    \n    DocImpact - Docker containers are now given CPU shares according to\n    the vcpu setting of the flavor used when creating the container.\n    Previously, the vcpu field was ignored and all containers got equal\n    CPU shares, regardless of the vcpu setting.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7184eddfd8bbd2cbaa07a48ebb40bc9aa3fbd4a9\n    Closes-Bug: #1256264\n",
