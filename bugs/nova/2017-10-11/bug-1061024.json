            "content": "There are three possible solutions I've considered:\n\n1) Rejecting the resize that would fail. One problem we've often run into are customers doing a resize down, but with too much data in the filesystem. With auto disk config, the resize will fail because the new root disk is smaller than can possibly hold all of the data in the root disk. This cannot be rejected at the API level because it requires shutting down the instance and inspecting the filesystem to determine how much disk is needed.\n\n2) Automatically reverting on migration failure. This would automatically clean up the partially built new instance and start up the old instance again. This would leave the user with the original instance but no indication what happened. This is because asynchronous errors are only visible to instances in ERROR state.\n\n3) Permit reverts from ERROR state. The API currently doesn't allow this state transition to happen and the implementation of it is pretty messy. It does allow the user to see what happened since the asynchronous error is visible and allows them to recover.\n",
