Since a move operation will only pass a single instance UUID to\n    migrate to the scheduler, there is a discrepancy that can lead to an\n    ugly IndexError. Defaulting that loop to be what is passed over RPC\n    unless we don't have it and then we default back to what we know from\n    the RequestSpec record.\n    \n    Change-Id: If7da79356174be57481ef246618221e3b2ff8200\n    Closes-Bug: #1708961\n",
