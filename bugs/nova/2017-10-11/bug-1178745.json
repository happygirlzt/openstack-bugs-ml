    "description": "Communication between instances on the same fixed network using assigned floating IP addresses does not behave in a consistent fashion. In all-in-one and (possibly) multi-host deployments, creating connections using floating IPs appear to work (at least within the confines of the security groups). However, with standalone compute nodes, instances that are on the same compute node cannot successfully create a connection. Routing and matching endpoints seem to be at the core of this issue.",

The patch\n    allows members of the same private network to communicate with each\n    other using their floating-ips in a more consistent fashion. The rule\n    also addresses the situation where the target is on another private\n    network.\n    \n    This will only work for interaction between two servers that both have\n    floating IPs assigned to them.\n    \n    Specifically, this patch solves the problem where a target server\n    \"sees\" the private address of the client. By SNAT'ing to the client's\n    floating-IP, the \"sees\" the correct reply address and the reverse\n    route follows the same path that an actual external connection would\n    take. The SNAT ONLY occurs if a DNAT occurred before hand, allowing\n    communication on private networks using private IPs to remain fully\n    private and internal. The limitation is of course if a DNAT occurs for\n    other reasons, there may be issues.\n    \n    Resolves bug 1178745\n    \n    Change-Id: I55b7131cff5fd5a2ebf826945370d4d550e74136\n",
