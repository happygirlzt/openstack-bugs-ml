This is unnecessary because the image is already exposed as a block drive by LVM/device mapper. Thus, the LVM device can be mounted directly to the rootfs of the instance.",

The resulting\n    ImageModel will actually represent the proper ImageModel for the\n    instance, and downstream mounting functions will be able to make\n    intelligent decisions on how to mount the instance's disks.\n    \n    It is not possible to use get_model for an instance booted from volume,\n    but we can still use LocalBlockImage in it's case because it is\n    simply exposed as a block device.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1287754\n    Change-Id: I0f4456731c9d6f64affbf6924f4a7a4c34df4fd1\n",
