    "description": "I'm embarrassed to say that while I finished Xen support quite a while ago, I never got around to filing the merge proposal. it was dependent on the orm_deux branch and I forgot all about it in the turmoil.\n\nXen support has been on our list of stuff we wanted to support in Austin since the beginning, so the desire to have it is certainly there. The Xen specific changes are pretty self-contained so shouldn't put anything else at risk. The only risky bit is the part that moves the code to get console output down into the virt drivers and the formatting of the response up into the api server. After much pain and suffering, I've gotten the unit tests for that bit of code running, so I'm fairly confident it works now.",
