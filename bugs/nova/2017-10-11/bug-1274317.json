In this case the method can only be called at\n    the default rate, calculated as min(60 seconds, <spacings from all\n    periodic_tasks>), regardless of the poll interval set in config.\n    \n    Although there was throttling code which prevented the methods from\n    executing too often, the case where we do want the method to execute\n    very often was missed.  This patch ensures that setting the config\n    values low will cause the method to be called as frequently.\n    \n    Change-Id: I1530c8b3b6ac71f4d9e2e41188c0eca4a6556e01\n    Closes-Bug: #1274317\n",
