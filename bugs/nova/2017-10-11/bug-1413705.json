If\n    they don't die fast enough, libvirt will raise an error. The\n    container will eventually die in most cases. So, instead of erroring\n    the destroy, we should let the wait_for_destroy logic continue to\n    see if the instance goes away.\n    \n    Change-Id: I1feb767e82bc77ad7ae63852a043d67844245626\n    Closes-Bug: #1413705\n",
