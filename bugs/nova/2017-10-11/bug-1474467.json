I do not care if I land in nova or az1 if no AZ is specified on boot but az2 is \"special\" and I do *not* want to land there by default. The only way around this that I can think of would be to disable the hypervisors in the az2 AZ and boot to them manually. However, if I disable the nodes in AZ2 I cannot simply boot to az2 and let the scheduler make the appropriate choice about where to schedule the instance.\n\nIt seems like it would make sense for default_schedule_zone to be a list option or since that might be a pain to keep track of... for there to be a sort of \"inverse\" option like excluded_schedule_zones.",
