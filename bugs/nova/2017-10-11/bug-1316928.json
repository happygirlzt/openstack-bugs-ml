But it does not without restarting. After restart state is changed to XXX and nova-compute is still polling API connection (good behavior) but without restart nova-compute has still smile state despite of \" SessionConnectionException: NV-06475AF urllib2 error in  RetrieveServiceContent: : <urlopen error [Errno 113] EHOSTUNREACH>\"\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Configure nova-compute to connect to VMware vCenter using vmware community driver.\n2. Check state of compute-node, it should be available\n3. Disconnect vCenter - for example just disconnect network from it\n4. Check state of compute-node, it still be available\n\nExpected result:\ncompute-node should be unavailable when vCenter is disconnected (maybe after api_retry_count?) without need to restart nova-compute.",
