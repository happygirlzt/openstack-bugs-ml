This is useful in the case of a compute API calling\n    network_api.show_port, e.g. the os-interface API.  The compute API\n    should expect a NovaException back from the network API rather than a\n    NeutronClientException (since the compute API shouldn't know if it's\n    talking to nova-network or neutron).\n    \n    Long-term we should refactor more of the neutronv2 API code to re-use\n    the show_port method since there are several places where\n    neutron.show_port is called directly with additional filtering, etc,\n    but they potentially also have the same exception translation issues.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1378389\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic76d3af6b31e501d9ded5f60da9106d5ef88f4b7\n",
