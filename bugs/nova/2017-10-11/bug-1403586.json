    "description": "The method Controller.create in nova/api/openstack/compute/servers.py has a complexity of 46 that is the most complex in Nova code and it is equal to the limit specified in tox.ini. This cause a pep8 error if someone tries to add a new api for server create action. This fail is unavoidable if one wants to keep consistency with the way other extensions are loaded, so a refactoring is necessary to lower the complexity.",

The complexity of the method was 46; it is now 22.\n    \n    No logic changes were made.\n    \n    This builds on the effort started with Change 129125 by Joe Gordon.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1403586\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib102091773f786b8c8dc5b79c6d776418ed1d57d\n",
