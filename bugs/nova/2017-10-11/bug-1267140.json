Neutron does, but Nova does\n    not proxy this to Neutron, nor will it.\n    \n    So add a note in the api-ref docs for creating security group\n    rules about the egress rule limitation with nova-network.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idc79cd1718b52db8611fd108b23f176f925221a6\n    Related-Bug: #1579749\n    Related-Bug: #1267140\n",
