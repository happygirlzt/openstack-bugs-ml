Previously both the 'version' and 'agent_build' were\n    required to be set.\n    \n    As the 'agent_build' table is primarily used for upgrades\n    there should be no requirement that a record exist in order\n    to configure admin passwords.\n    \n    Fixes LP Bug #925237.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie4530a30ed02f3d49a07037e9d1cc52ef0af1dd4\n",
