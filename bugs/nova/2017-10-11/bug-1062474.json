Only the 'id' and 'uuid' column get populated with data copied from the volumes or instances table  in the migration that creates them.  From what I can tell, none of these fields are currently being used by code anywhere in Folsom, but this has already introduced a nasty Bug #1061166.\n\nIf the plan is to be able to query this info from this table in Grizzly, they should be fully populated with data for existing instances.  If there is no plan to make use of them, they should be dropped.\n\nAdditionally, there should probably be some uniqueness constraints on those  tables to ensure these mappings stay consistent if similar bugs exist elsewhere in the code base.",
