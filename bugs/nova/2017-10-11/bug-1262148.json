Later, when importing \"nova.openstack.common.memorycache\" which also has the same option \"memcached_servers\" , that option  is never registered because we already have the same option from keystoneclient registered.\n\nWhen the config.generator \"_guess_groups()\"  the option \"memcached_servers\" from \"nova.openstack.common.memorycache\", it uses operator '==' to compare if two options are the same. But the oslo.cfg.Opt class doesn't implement the __eq__ method, it only implements the __ne__ method. That's why the '==' operator doesn't give us the expected result.\n\nWe should implement the __eq__ method in oslo.cfg. Before that, we should use 'not a == b' in the config.generator as a temporary workaround.",

On the face of it, the code in Oslo is doing exactly what it intended: finding options that have been registered twice in the same group and raising the error:\n\n  \"Unable to find group for option memcached_servers, maybe it's defined twice in the same group?\"\n\nAfter this change, the code no longer detects these errors as intended. Worse, now if a similar option is defined in a different group, that option will fail to show up in the output (see bug 1288586).\n\nIt seems like one or both of these Nova options should be in a separate group, so that they can be configured independently.",
