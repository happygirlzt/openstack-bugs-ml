We should remove misleading note about possible race and exception and added order_by() to ensure that the same record is updated every time.\n\nIdeally we should add UniqueConstraint for BandwidthUsage model to prevent multiple bw usage records existing for the same date range and UUID. That fix for this will mean we should be able to remove the .first() call and instead use .one().",

So the duplicate entry problem is solved by\n    db itself and db_exc.DBDuplicateEntry could not be raised in Nova.\n    \n    Ideally we should add UniqueConstraint to prevent multiple bw usage\n    records existing for the same date range and UUID. That fix for this\n    will mean we should be able to remove the .first() call and instead\n    use .one(). The current code that uses .first() is not correct\n    because there is no order_by() applied on the SQL query and\n    therefore the returned \"first record\" is indeterminate.\n    \n    This workaround fix removed misleading note and exception and\n    added order_by() to ensure that the same record is updated every time.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Sergey Nikitin <email address hidden>\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1614561\n    \n    Change-Id: I408bc3a3e5623965a619d8c7241e4e77c8bf44f5\n",
