I think I see the problem in nova/api/openstack/images.py:133 but I can't track down the associated tests ... if I am correct, we just need to change this line:\n\n             return self.get_builder(req).build(image, detail=True)\n\nto this:\n\n             return dict(image=self.get_builder(req).build(image, detail=True))\n\nMy branch with this fix (but no tests) is attached if you want to try it.",
