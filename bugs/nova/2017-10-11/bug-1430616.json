For this bug, it only happened at the start up phase. \nPersonally I don't think it's a right behavior to just shutdown nova-compute if ironic-api service stopped.  You can always launch an instance even if nova-compute is stopped. And you will get error like:\n\"message\": \"No valid host was found. There are not enough hosts available.\"\nI also tried to just stop ironic-api but keeps nova-compute running, the same error for the instance:\n\"message\": \"No valid host was found. There are not enough hosts available.\"\nSo it's better to keep nova-compute and once ironic-api is back, it can recover immediately.\n\nBTW, what information do you want to change the status back to normal from incomplete?
