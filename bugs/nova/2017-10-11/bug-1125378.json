During this time if a new VM is spawned on the host and kvm reuses the port to bind the vncserver, it's possible for the user to use the old token to get access to this new VM, which could be owned by someone else.\n\nI have seen this happening in Essex code and was wondering if this is still the case. The possible solutions are to flush the tokens on vm delete, hard reboot etc or to have a password protected VNC session.",
