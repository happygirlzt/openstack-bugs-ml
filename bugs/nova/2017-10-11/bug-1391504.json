    "description": "Regarding OpenStack policies, in general, the described roles seem quite complicated, it is not clear which roles are appropriated for each user. For example, in many policies it is defined just a global admin role. We would like to clarify what are the role organizations, for example, cloud_admin is the role for the cloud managers, domain_admin is the role for the domain managers, project_admin for the project admin and project_member a member with a role in a project but with no admin permissions. In this way, it is clear for the cloud manager which capability is being given to a user. The idea is create a policy.cloudsample.json, where roles as cloud_admin project_admin, and project_member will be defined and some default permissions, making policies closer to the business reality.",
