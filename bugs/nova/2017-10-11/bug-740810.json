            "content": "I received some clarification from Vish about why this occurs.\n\nnova-manage looks for num_networks && network_size flags, but if they are left out, it disregards the CIDR arg provided and instead uses the FLAGS.network_size (default to 256) && FLAGS.network_number (default to 1) to carve out the network.   The reason for this as explained:\n\n1. large networks such as /16 created without being split into smaller networks will take a very long to create, and the assumption is that nobody would ever use without being split\n2. the idea is that you can provide one large subnet such as a /16 and not immediately want to split ALL the networks at the given time, and therefore the num_networks && network_size args are there for you to split off a smaller subset for immediate use and then carve out the rest at a later time.\n\nSince the current behavior is the desired behavior, the problem is simply the conveying of it is confusing.  My suggestion is perhaps just some verbosity such as an informative message explaining the default to /24 (when CIDR is larger than /24) , would alleviate some of the confusion.",

Also some improved error checking to see 'network_size' should be one of the divisibles of a CIDR such as 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2",
