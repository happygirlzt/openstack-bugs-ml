    "description": "The problem is that Xen wants to create a new tap device with the defined vifname but that's not possible because it was already created by QuantumLinuxBridgeVIFDriver. If the device with the defined vifname already exists Xen creates and uses a new device with the name vif$DOMAIN.0. It's ending with a not working network connectiviy.\n\nIf QuantumLinuxBridgeVIFDriver is used it should not create a new tap device if libvirt_type = 'xen'.",
