The sr-uuid must be\n    generated and provided by the xenapi storage manager.\n    \n    When the volume service is started, SM volume driver will\n    create a new SR for everything that does not have an\n    existing sr_uuid and will populate the db with the result.\n    It will only introduce the SRs that do have one. The introduce\n    will work only if the uuid provided is something SM understands.\n    \n    This partially reverts commit 77495cfed17f12f225e11fbc10e0f8db516dadf2.\n    Changes in db are left intact.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8405ac905a15f829f704951b94297f3b6f6c0a29\n",
