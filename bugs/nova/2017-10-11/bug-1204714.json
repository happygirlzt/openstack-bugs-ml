However the process\n    of deallocating an IP address still creates an entry in the\n    reservations table.\n    \n    The VlanManager now loads the NoopQuotaDriver and no longer\n    writes superflously to the database.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idf95085a5c1f4e71f3f0fc92618607073602eed3\n    Fixes: Bug #1204714\n",
