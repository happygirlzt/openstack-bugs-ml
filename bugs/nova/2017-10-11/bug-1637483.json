    "description": "As an operator, I want to be able to use oslo healthcheck middleware[1] to Nova's pipeline so that I can GET the /healthcheck URI to determine \"up\" or not for a given nova-api host. The healthcheck middleware allows for manually setting the health status to offline, without actually stopping the API service. When I can do this, I can easily \"take an API node offline\" from the aspect of the load balancer, which uses the healthcheck path for status checks, before stopping the API process itself. This is a quick and generic way to prevent new connections to a given API node while restarting it as part of a rolling restart.\n\nThis middleware has already been added to glance[2], and I've got an open review to add it to keystone as well[3]. My eventual goal is to have it in use across all the services that directly listen for client connections.\n\n1: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/oslo.middleware/healthcheck_plugins.html\n2: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/148595/\n3: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/387731/",
