The default was inadvertently changed in the great\n    oslo sync at the start of Havana, this returns it to what was in at the\n    end of Grizzly.\n    \n    Adds support for lazy instantiation of the logger.\n    \n    Bug 1167081\n    Bug 1165211\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibe41afc6e9d7b432453785819821b3c8f0078613\n",
