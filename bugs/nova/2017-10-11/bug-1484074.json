First of all\n    it's because snapshot_extract method is not implemented\n    in imagebackend.Ploop class. There are also issues in\n    utils.extract_snapshot, find_disk and get_disk_type.\n    \n    This patch solves all those issues, so snapshots will\n    work with parallels virt_type.\n    \n    DocImpact: parallels now supports snapshot\n    Closes-bug: 1484074\n    Implements: blueprint ploop-snapshot-support\n    \n    Change-Id: Id3b5bfc946a858f7e6ed710f2b44c7ca63a10723\n",
