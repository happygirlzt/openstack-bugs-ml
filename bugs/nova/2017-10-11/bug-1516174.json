This can overwhelm notification consumers as instance.update notifications double in quantity, especially over short time periods like during multiple simultaneous instance creations.\n\nThat commit used the Instance.skip_cells_sync() contextmanager with Instance.save() in instance_update_at_top() to prevent update cycles between api and compute cells, but the notification in Instance.save() is not guarded by _sync_cells, so notifications generated in compute cells are also generated in api cells.",
