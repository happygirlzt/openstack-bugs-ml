For example: search=foo would match any object that has the value 'foo' as a substring of at least one of the eligible fields. The search can also be restricted to a single field as follows: search=field_name%3Dfield_value (which when URL decoded is: field_name=field_value).\n\nIn the same way, I need to be able to frame a query to nova api, to return me available options available from nova api such as server, server/detail,images etc. This could considerably ease QA ability to do manual testing using curl, across api upgrades and also sufficiently advanced users, need not have to necessarily read API docs all the time for minor doubts and clarifications.",
