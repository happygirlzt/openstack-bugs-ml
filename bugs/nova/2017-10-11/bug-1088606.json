    "description": "By omitting the reserved count from the total<Resource>Used elements in the response, the os-used-limits API extension prevents the caller from gaining the most accurate picture of the actual headroom.\n\nFor example, if the current instances quota is 10, the in_use count is 9 and an instance creation is in-flight, then the values for maxTotalInstances and totalInstanceUsed will imply that there is headroom to create a further resource. In fact this will not be the case, as the single reserved instance will prevent a new instance being spun up.\n\nWe should support a query param to control whether the reserved count is included:\n\n  GET /v2/<TENANT_ID>/limits => do not include reserved count \n\n  GET /v2/<TENANT_ID>/limits?reserved=0 => do not include reserved count\n\n  GET /v2/<TENANT_ID>/limits?reserved=1 => include reserved count in the total<Resource>Used values",
