We should either provide back data in the ComputeResourcesUnavailble object or raise different exceptions based on what is not available.  This may point to a bigger issue of a broken scheduler.",

It tests memory, disk, and cpu separately and could return either a tuple of bools or a dict of True/False values with the keys indicating the resources.  Then the resource tracker can update the ComputeResourcesUnavailable exception with appropriate information.  It's probably best to just keep the single exception and stuff data into it because there are many possible combinations of which resources are not available.",

All failure reasons are described in the\n    exception message. EG:\n    \n      \"Insufficient compute resources: Free memory 8192.00 MB <\n      requested 16384 MB; Free disk 45.00 GB < requested 50 GB; Free CPUs\n      16.00 VCPUs < requested 17 VCPUs.\"\n    \n    Change-Id: I5bf9c81bba747a6c164144e60a92dc6da2f98f4c\n    Closes-Bug: #1212768\n",
