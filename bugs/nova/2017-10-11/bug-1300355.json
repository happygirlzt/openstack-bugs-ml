    "description": "There is a small error in the logic of how we handle releasing fixed ips. When dnsmasq is restarted, it calls nova-dhcpbridge to list the existing leases that nova knows about. Currently we only return leases for ips that are allocated. Since we deallocate addresses before we reload dnsmasq, this can cause dnsmasq to lose knowledge of the ip addresses. The result is that the release dhcp packet does not end up triggering a DEL message in nova-dhcpbridge, and the leased flag remains set.\n\nNote that this will only very rarely cause an issue in the current code base, since we generally HUP dnsmasq instead of reloading it. Some changes to dnsmasq do require a full restart (to handle different domains, for example), so this has the potential to cause surprising bugs in the future. The ip will eventually recovered by a cleanup task, but the logic in this path should be fixed.",

This modifies nova to return leased but not allocated\n    addresses. It also delays removing the vif until we disassociate\n    the ip so we still have access to the mac address.\n    \n    Resolves-bug: 1300355\n    \n    Change-Id: Id78d66aad5005f052a1b49002de0ef13ef5a298d\n",
