It\n    also had an unnecessary join through virtual interfaces. We have a\n    denormalized field for instance_uuid with an index in the fixed_ips\n    table that we can use. This patch removes the unnecessary join and\n    ads an extra filter inside the OR to reject fixed_ips without\n    instances. In my test with 300000 fixed ips, this reduced the query\n    time from about 2.5 seconds to less than 0.01 seconds.\n    \n    Change-Id: I26fb0dfaf5ff64bd70c947982de4ec1728c84856\n    Resolves-bug: #1369009\n",
