This makes our tests hard to understand, because there's no way to tell if that network really is needed for the tests to succeed or not. I tried commenting it out and running the test suite. Only 15 failures. That's 0.7%. Certainly not enough to justify having this a \"mystery guest\" in every other test case.",
