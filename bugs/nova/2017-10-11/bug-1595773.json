The following modes are supported:\n    \n     * stack\n    \n        When deleting, check whether any previous versions exist in the\n        versions container. If none is found, the object is deleted. If the\n        most-recent version in the versions container is not a delete\n        marker, it is copied into the versioned container (overwriting the\n        current version if one exists) and then deleted from the versions\n        container. This preserves the previous behavior.\n    \n        If the most-recent version in the versions container is a delete\n        marker and a current version exists in the versioned container, the\n        current version is deleted. If the most-recent version in the\n        versions container is a delete marker and no current version exists\n        in the versioned container, we copy the next-most-recent version\n        from the versions container into the versioned container (assuming\n        it exists and is not a delete marker) and delete both the\n        most-recent version (i.e., the delete marker) and the just-copied\n        next-most-recent version from the versions container.\n    \n        With this mode, DELETEs to versioned containers \"undo\" operations\n        on containers. Previously this was limited to undoing PUTs, but now\n        it will also undo DELETEs performed while in \"history\" mode.\n    \n     * history\n    \n        When deleting, check whether a current version exists in the\n        versioned container. If one is found, it is copied to the versions\n        container. Then an empty \"delete marker\" object is also put into the\n        versions container; this records when the object was deleted.\n        Finally, the original current version is deleted from the versioned\n        container. As a result, subsequent GETs or HEADs will return a 404,\n        and container listings for the versioned container do not include\n        the object.\n    \n        With this mode, DELETEs to versioned containers behave like DELETEs\n        to other containers, but with a history of what has happened.\n    \n    Clients may specify (via a new X-Versions-Mode header) which mode a\n    container should use. By default, the existing \"stack\" mode is used.\n    \n    Upgrade consideration:\n    ======================\n    \n    Clients should not use the \"history\" mode until all proxies in the\n    cluster have been upgraded. Attempting to use the \"history\" mode during\n    a rolling upgrade may result in some requests being served by proxies\n    running old code (which necessarily uses the \"stack\" mode), leading to\n    data loss.\n    \n    Change-Id: I555dc17fefd0aa9ade681aa156da24e018ebe74b\n\ncommit bb87fcefced099a56537edd0db7ca965e9902f5a\nAuthor: liujiong <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Aug 14 00:43:47 2016 +0800\n\n    Fix typo in the file\n    \n    Change-Id: I6539e9b9fb7918e387e8ae802be7b4efbcb07f4d\n\ncommit aab2cee827b18fe1c48f121d2c9066af2dd0c366\nAuthor: Andreas Jaeger <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Aug 12 21:18:07 2016 +0200\n\n    Move other-requirements.txt to bindep.txt\n    \n    The default filename for documenting binary dependencies has been\n    changed from \"other-requirements.txt\" to \"bindep.txt\" with the release\n    of bindep 2.1.0.

  Currently, the expirer daemon treats 412 (precondition failed)\n    as successful DELETEs.\n    \n    On the other hand, it treats 404 as failed while reclaim_age\n    (usually a week) has not passed.\n    This patch unifies both cases to the same handling: waiting for\n    reclaim_age to pass, then deleting the entry.\n    \n    The reason the expirer should not delete a 412 entry right away,\n    is that it might be the case that 412 is returned because of\n    a split brain, where the updated object servers are currently down.\n    Same reason holds for a 404 response.\n    \n

That is validated when servers waking\n    up. However, Swift has more chance to load such an invalid ring when\n    a request comming, calling some node iteration like get_nodes,\n    get_part_nodes or so, and no ring validation is there.\n    \n    This patch moves ring validation from policy validate_ring into the ring\n    instance as validation_hook that will run at ring reload. Since this patch,\n    ring instance will allow to use the old ring if the reload is not fourced.\n    \n    Note that the exception if invalid ring found was changed from\n    RingValidationError to RingLoadError because RingValidationError is a\n    child of RingBuilderError but the ring reload is obviously outside of\n    \"builder\".\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1534572\n    \n    Change-Id: I6428fbfb04e0c79679b917d5e57bd2a34f2a0875\n\ncommit 3a1a198780433e6ebf2bcc3862bd63c7d033930d\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Sun Jul 3 22:03:20 2016 -0700\n\n    Raise ValueError if empty value coming into encrypt_header_val\n    \n    encrypt_header_val is used to translate a raw header value into an\n    encrypted value. Semantically, a header with an empty value won't be stored\n    and all callers seem to remove such a header before calling\n    encrypted_header_val.\n    \n    So if no reason for returning ('', None), I think it's better to change it to\n    raise ValueError not to cause another error for users of the return value.\n    (e.g. dump_crypto_meta)\n    \n    Plus this patch addes a few unit

defined in swift.conf statically\n    so let's cache the value after retrieving the value from the pyeclib driver.\n    \n    And more, pyeclib <= 1.2.1 (current newest) has a bug [1] to leak the reference\n    count of the items in the returned dict (i.e. causes memory leak) so that\n    this caching will be mitigation of the memory leak because this saves the call\n    count fewer than

Unfortunately the current container update override headers\n    (x-backend-container-update-override-*) are not persisted with the\n    object metadata so are not available when handling a POST.\n    \n    For EC there is an ugly hack in the object server to use the\n    x-object-sysmeta-ec-[etag,size] values when doing a container update\n    for a POST.\n    \n    With crypto, the encryption middleware needs to override the etag\n    (possibly overriding the already overridden EC etag value) with an\n    encrypted etag value. We therefore have a similar problem that this\n    override value is not persisted at the object server.\n    \n    This patch introduces a new namespace for container override headers,\n    x-object-sysmeta-container-update-override-*, which uses object\n    sysmeta so that override values are persisted. This allows a general\n    mechanism in the object server to apply the override values (if any\n    have been set) from object sysmeta when constructing a container\n    update for a PUT or a POST. Middleware should use the\n    x-object-sysmeta-container-update-override-* namespace when setting\n    container update overrides. Middleware should be aware that other\n    middleware may have already set container override headers, in which\n    case consideration should be given to whether any existing value should\n    take precedence.\n    \n    For backwards compatibility the existing\n    x-backend-container-update-override-* style headers are still\n    supported in the object server for EC override values, and the ugly\n    hack for EC etag/size override in POST updates remains in the object\n    server. That allows an older proxy server to be used with an upgraded\n    object server. The proxy server continues to use the\n    x-backend-container-update-override-* style headers for EC values so\n    that an older object server will continue to work with an upgraded\n    proxy server.\n    \n    x-object-sysmeta-container-update-override-* headers take precedence\n    over x-backend-container-update-override-* headers and the use of\n    x-backend-container-update-override-* headers by middleware is\n    deprecated.  Existing third party middleware that is using\n    x-backend-container-update-override-* headers should be modified to\n    use x-object-sysmeta-container-update-override-* headers in order to\n    be compatible with other middleware such as encryption and to ensure\n    that container updates during POST requests carry correct values. If\n    targeting multiple versions of Swift object servers it may be\n    necessary to send headers from both namespaces. However, in general it\n    is recommended to upgrade all backend servers, then upgrade proxy\n    servers before finally upgrading third party middleware.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Tim Burke <email address hidden>\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib80b4db57dfc2d37ea8ed3745084a3981d082784\n\ncommit 03b762e80a9b3d33ce13b8222f4cd2b549171c51\nAuthor: Janie Richling <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jun 6 17:19:48 2016 +0100\n\n    Support for http footers - Replication and EC\n    \n    Before this patch, the proxy ObjectController supported sending\n    metadata from the proxy server to object servers in \"footers\" that\n    trail the body of HTTP PUT requests, but this support was for EC\n    policies only.  The encryption feature requires that footers are sent\n    with both EC and replicated policy requests in order to persist\n    encryption specific sysmeta, and to override container update headers\n    with an encrypted Etag value.\n    \n    This patch:\n    \n    - Moves most of the functionality of ECPutter into a generic Putter\n      class that is used for replicated object PUTs without footers.\n    \n    - Creates a MIMEPutter subclass to support multipart and multiphase\n      behaviour required for any replicated object PUT with footers and\n      all EC PUTs.\n    \n    - Modifies ReplicatedObjectController to use Putter objects in place\n      of raw connection objects.\n    \n    - Refactors the _get_put_connections method and _put_connect_node methods\n      so that more code is in the BaseObjectController class and therefore\n      shared by [EC|Replicated]ObjectController classes.\n    \n    - Adds support to call a callback that middleware may have placed\n      in the environ, so the callback can set footers. The\n      x-object-sysmeta-ec- namespace is reserved and any footer values\n      set by middleware in that namespace will not be forwarded to\n      object servers.\n    \n    In addition this patch enables more than one value to be added to the\n    X-Backend-Etag-Is-At header. This header is used to point to an\n    (optional) alternative sysmeta header whose value should be used when\n    evaluating conditional requests with If-[None-]Match headers.  This is\n    already used with EC policies when the ECObjectController has\n    calculated the actual body Etag and sent it using a footer\n    (X-Object-Sysmeta-EC-Etag). X-Backend-Etag-Is-At is in that case set\n    to X-Object-Sysmeta-Ec-Etag so as to point to the actual body Etag\n    value rather than the EC fragment Etag.\n    \n    Encryption will also need to add a pointer to an encrypted Etag value.\n    However, the referenced sysmeta may not exist, for example if the\n    object was created before encryption was enabled. The\n    X-Backend-Etag-Is-At value is therefore changed to support a list of\n    possible locations for alternate Etag values. Encryption will place\n    its expected alternative Etag location on this list, as will the\n    ECObjectController, and the object server will look for the first\n    object metadata to match an entry on the list when matching\n    conditional requests. That way, if the object was not encrypted then\n    the object server will fall through to using the EC Etag value, or in\n    the case of a replicated policy will fall through to using the normal\n    Etag metadata.\n    \n    If your proxy has a third-party middleware that uses X-Backend-Etag-Is-At\n    and it upgrades before an object server it's talking to then conditional\n    requests may be broken.\n    \n    UpgradeImpact\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Alistair Coles <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Thiago da Silva <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Samuel Merritt <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1594739\n    Change-Id: I12a6e41150f90de746ce03623032b83ed1987ee1\n\ncommit 4b1387968078bde6dcaeace5e390478d93b1780a\nAuthor: Cloud User <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed May 4 02:00:53 2016 +0000\n\n    Adds migrated API reference files\n    \n    This brings in RST plus YAML files, migrated from the source for [0].\n    \n    The migration explanation is found on the openstack-dev mailing list [1].\n    \n    Project instruction is in the OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide [2].\n    \n    A patch for publishing this source is in [3].\n    \n    The conf.py and the tox environment are standard across other projects.\n    \n    [0]http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-objectstorage-v1.html\n    [1]http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-May/093765.html\n    [2]http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/api-guides.html\n    [3]https://review.openstack.org/#/c/313015/\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifebc65b188c4f2ba35b61c0deae5ec24401df7f9\n\ncommit c0217a4845e2ea780dc4dcb61877e604bc488729\nAuthor: Andreas Jaeger <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 21 07:56:35 2016 +0200\n\n    Update Sphinx version\n    \n    The api-ref document needs a newer sphinx version, allow a 1.2 Sphinx\n    version to be used - like it's used in global-requirements.txt.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9183cc56753fbe7e41206c6a9081899df5c3919a\n    Needed-By: Ifebc65b188c4f2ba35b61c0deae5ec24401df7f9\n\ncommit 5885d97b7df787ccd64777174b59c48e6dbfaa06\nAuthor: John Dickinson <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jun 17 12:24:57 2016 -0700\n\n    added note to testFileSizeLimit functional test\n    \n    Change-Id: I0323ff2511506c354db3416f1b37ede772acaedb\n\ncommit da4a59f8e276e80764b58f9c52d6a3c2bca06782\nAuthor: Or Ozeri <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jun 16 11:14:14 2016 +0300\n\n    pickle_async_update should create tmp_dir\n    \n    While creating a probe test for the expirer daemon, I found\n    the following error scenario:\n    \n    1.

This diff removes some places where we catch AttributeError\n    (sometimes, having deliberately thrown it only one line before) so\n    that typos can crash the way Guido intended.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2f7586f96b41a97e6ae254efc83218b3b5c6cc9e\n\ncommit 65a9a6d21b81a000effd911cab5613a3fa6a784e\nAuthor: Christian Schwede <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 7 11:27:56 2016 +0000\n\n    Add simple multiple server type test\n    \n    Ensures that swift-recon actually gathers data from multiple\n    server types if more than one is given on the command line.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4017b82fb044265ec117df01e14968752df02201\n\ncommit 6c9a1899a182d58232a95af92dae168df9e131d5\nAuthor: Mohit Motiani <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue May 31 20:53:03 2016 +0000\n\n    Adds region as a search-value in manpage\n    \n    This patch adds region and example related to it in the man page\n    of swift-ring-builder.\n    \n    Change-Id: I12ceab4e41240240cf2daa77dad94729dd1fd76d\n\ncommit 7a50972104095478c91a477f5c5499dda4372711\nAuthor: John Dickinson <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jun 9 11:22:37 2016 -0700\n\n    update .gitreview\n    \n    Change-Id: I9593e453891c137fd430a44306e17268ba45fd12\n\ncommit f6b0b75a25ef970e8bad67f554c82df676e0d172\nAuthor: Christian Schwede <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jun 8 10:01:39 2016 +0000\n\n    Make test_ringbuilder less brittle\n    \n    If one has an object.builder file in the current directory and runs\n    test_ringbuilder, it will fail with an irritating error. That's because\n    test_use_ringfile_as_builderfile doesn't use self.tmpfile, but\n    object.builder - and that one might exist in the local directory.\n    \n    This patch changes this, using self.tmpfile as argument name.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1590356\n    Change-Id: I4b3287a36e8a5e469eb037128427dc7867910e53\n\ncommit 334140a543cb16aa4c7b01b1f4371fc4e982032f\nAuthor: Mohit Motiani <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jun 7 19:08:50 2016 +0000\n\n    Removed whitespaces from swift-ring-builder manpage\n    \n    Change-Id: I25cf69f8d963ba84df4c59129d72ee39ec341bd3\n\ncommit fcb6e4cd3aa6896976733c57c683592358e4c6f0\nAuthor: Kota Tsuyuzaki <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Jul 2 00:35:02 2015 -0700\n\n    Last-Modified header support on HEAD/GET container\n    \n    This patch enables to show a x-put-timestamp as\n    a last-modified header in container-server.\n    \n    Note that the last-modified header will be changed only when a\n    request for container (PUT container or POST container) comes into\n    Swift. i.e. some requests for objects (e.g. PUT object, POST object)\n    will never affect the last-modified value but only when using\n    python-swiftclient like as \"swift upload\", the last-modified will\n    be close to the upload time because python-swiftclient will make\n    a PUT container request for \"swift upload\" each time.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9971bf90d24eee8921f67c02b7e2c80fd8995623\n\ncommit 66c77e049dc60ec012fb34a45ef9531f11ea906a\nAuthor: Sivasathurappan Radhakrishnan <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Feb 19 21:54:12 2016 +0000\n\n    Added unit test cases for cli/recon.py\n    \n    Added unit test cases to cover code paths of umount_check\n    and async_check function.\n    \n    Change-Id: I236d24b1b22ce244b3fb9546ff31223426edb8ed\n\ncommit ef942dadebc038a82d9198b8048244c980cd2c24\nAuthor: Peter Lis\u00e1k <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Nov 13 13:56:13 2015 +0100\n\n    Call swift-recon with more than one server type\n    \n    Examples:\n    * get auditor stats from account and container server\n    swift-recon account container --auditor\n    * perform all checks on all servers\n    swift-recon account container object --all\n    \n    Change-Id: I05bb7c785e6a4d80969d90448f1b9e0fd08dae86\n    Co-Authored-By: Ond\u0159ej Nov\u00fd <email address hidden>\n\ncommit efdf123a402b373a2d572e777f535c21241b4bb8\nAuthor: Andy McCrae <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 15:46:24 2016 +0100\n\n    [Docs] Document prevention of disk full scenarios\n    \n    Adds section to detail how to prevent disk full scenarios from\n    occurring.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iafb4a47fa4892f6067252f3a80de87cd76506a40\n\ncommit b72141979f8766f411d2fea8fe8856b157bc9b91\nAuthor: Yatin Kumbhare <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Dec 14 17:04:34 2015 +0530\n\n    Fixed inconsistencies in docstrings\n    \n    Fixed :returns:, and few one-line comments as per\n    the docstring guide lines.\n    http://docs.openstack.org/developer/hacking/#docstrings\n    \n    Change-Id: I36ecf4faf5b49e070c13eb6324841ebcf442524f\n",
