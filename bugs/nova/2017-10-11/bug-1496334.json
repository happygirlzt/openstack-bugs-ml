The workflow of VMware driver is power-off instance, then wait task finish, then delete the instance.\n* After all the deleting instances are handled, nova-compute is set to \"up\" state, continue to work.\n\nstep 3 will spend lots of time on serial init_instance. In my performance test environment, the nova-compute spend about 15 minutes to finish init_instance.\n\nIn other drivers, like: libvirt, nova-compute manage less instances than VMware driver (maybe less than 50 instances), so these drivers have less chance to face the issue.",

Doing in parallel is not\n> really guarunteed to be faster than serial, and in some situations\n> will actually be slower.\n> \n> So this isn't a simple bug fix. It's something which we really should\n> have a spec for. There definitely has to be a max number which \n> is < 200. It should also have some real world boot data to see how\n> this plays out in real world situations.\n\nI'm closing it as \"Opinion/Wishlist\". If you decide to work on this\nconsider using a blueprint [2] (with a spec [3]). I'll recommend to \nread [4] if not yet done. \n\nIf there are any questions left, feel free to contact me (markus_z)\nin the IRC channel #openstack-nova\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/223572/\n[2] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[3] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[4] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
