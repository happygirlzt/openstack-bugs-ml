The volume goes back to available.  The hard part is creating a situation in which step 2 fails.  One way is to create enough quantum ports to exceed your port quota prior to attempting to spawn the instance.\n\n3. Delete the volume.\n4. Attempt to delete the instance.  An exception gets thrown  by driver.destroy because the volume is not found but the exception is not ignored and the instance can never be deleted.  Exceptions from _cleanup_volumes get ignored for this same reason.  I think another exception handler needs to be added to also ignore VolumeNotFound from driver.destroy.\n\nI've reproduced this with current code from trunk.",

If the failure is in the networking\n    stage Nova will not have attached the volume via the Cinder driver,\n    and so the volume remains in an available state.  In this state the\n    volume may be deleted or assigned to another instance.\n    During the subsequent delete an exception may be thrown from\n    the cinder driver which prevents the instance from completing the\n    deletion process leaving the instance stuck in Error and unable to\n    be deleted.\n    \n    Volume exceptions should be logged and ignored when the instance\n    is being deleted.\n    \n    Closes-Bug #1222979\n    \n    Change-Id: Icb3796b0ddba25cf344953a649b2e762fab6d782\n",
