That is, prior to\n    Liberty, we stored the percentages in compute_nodes.metrics as a\n    floating point value in the range [0, 1]. For example, 17.5% was\n    represented as 0.175.\n    \n    The revamped framework expects the MonitorMetric.value properties to\n    be integers, so when the percentages such as 0.175 are stored in this\n    object, they're erroneously converted to 0.\n    \n    This patch multiplies the 'problematic' fields by 100 in preparation\n    for storage within the MonitorMetric object and then divides the\n    same problematic fields by 100.0 when converting back to their JSON\n    format, which will preserve RPC notifier and database compatibility.\n    \n    Added some unit tests to test the conversions as well as making some\n    of the unit tests more explicit so this doesn't happen again.\n    \n    Change-Id: I17a9412c63eeeb78ba2b2600f9007e9b58fcbf68\n    Closes-Bug: #1488696\n",
