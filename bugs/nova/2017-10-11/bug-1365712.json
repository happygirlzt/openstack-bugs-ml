Generally speaking, securing server configuration files is deemed to be the domain of distributions, deployers and operators and while we should make that as easy as reasonably possible, not doing this for them doesn't necessarily translate to a vulnerability in OpenStack itself.",

We have an OSSN about this which will be released soon.  We just wanted to get a bug filed for this specific instance.  @dave-mccowan will be working on a fix.  ",
