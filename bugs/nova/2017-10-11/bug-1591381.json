    "description": "As opposed to metadata or other attributes of an instance tags can be set very early in the instance lifecycle. This will eventually lead to issues if the boot process makes use of these tags because setting them before boot will be a race condition. And there is a proposed spec which intends to do exactly that, use tags in the scheduling process.\n\nTo be consistent and to avoid future racy behavior instance tags should only be settable after a boot request after it has gone to ACTIVE status. Passing instance tags in as part of the boot request would be desirable behavior but requires a spec and is outside the scope of this bug.",

If instance tag\n    update is requested outside of the valid states, a 409 conflict error\n    will be returned.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1591381\n    \n    Change-Id: Id53a31654e105854f4942e6d47a1bea90a3e9c3b\n",
