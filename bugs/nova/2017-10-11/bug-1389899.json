            "content": "I agree with Alex -- this sounds like a semantic change. Currently in nova, delete is always allowed to succeed i.e. we soft delete, even when the compute node is unavailable. Quota will be returned to the user and the ip address will be freed. The idea behind this is that for the user, it should be transparent to them whether or not the compute node their instance is on is up or not. They should anyway be allowed to delete their instance as normal, and nova will handle reaping the soft deleted instance when the compute node is available again or when the operator migrates it to an up node.",
