    "description": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have found a bug in your code with spice. To sum it up, it doesn't work with the last version of websockify you put on your repositories for debian wheezy.\n\nIn fact, you have put websockify 0.6 in your repositories, and it requires a new object ( ProxyRequestHandler ) to handle a new connection instead of just call the new_client function. But in the object NovaWebSocketProxy, you still redefine this function to make the rpc call to consoleauth and you don't use the request handler now required. The result is that it uses the default function of webosckify to handle a new client connection.\n\nI solved the bug by replacing the source of websockify 0.6 by the 0.5.1 ones and it now works like a charm. But this is not really user-friendly.\n\nregards.\nAxel Vanzaghi",
