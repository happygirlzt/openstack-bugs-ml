    "description": "The mock representation of vmware vSphere objects in fake.py is incorrect at many places. I will highlight some of them :-\n\n1. The object returned by retrieveProperties API in the vsphere WebServices SDK will be an ObjectContent. But the current implementation uses ManagedObject. \nSee :- https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/vmwareapi/fake.py#L797\nRef :- http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-51/index.jsp#com.vmware.wssdk.apiref.doc/vmodl.query.PropertyCollector.html#retrieveContents\n\n2. ManagedObjects are associated with unique managed object id's. The current implementation defaults the ID's at the time of creating the objects. Thus there is only one unique instance per managed entity type. \n\n3. Every ManagedObject has a ManagedObjectReference created as an attribute on the class. This is wrong. A ManagedObjectReference is a data object that holds the managed object's ID. \n\n4. HostSystem objects should be allowed to be in connected or disconnected modes. This will allow negative test cases to work. \n\n5. ClusterComputeResource is an aggregate object. Currently, there is no way to add multiple hosts or resource pools or datastores to a cluster.\n\n6. Datastore object needs improvement to indicate the state of the object and other critical attributes. \n\nThese and few other limitations with the fixtures makes a lot of code churn in the fake.py file resulting in merge conflicts for developers. If the infrastructure is setup in a robust way, a lot of new tests can be added without modifying the fakes that much. This will also allow developers to increase the code coverage for the driver.",
