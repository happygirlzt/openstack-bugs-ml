Since our exception messages are\n    translated, they can contain unicode and if we hit a duplicate flavor\n    exception while performing online flavor migrations it will break the\n    migration and block any further migrations until resolved - which would\n    require manual intervention.\n    \n    This patch fixes the bug so that we use six.text_type instead of str\n    for logging the duplicate exception and adds a test to exhibit the bug\n    and prove it's fixed.\n    \n    On a side note, it's curious that we don't delete the duplicate flavor\n    from the main database during the online data migration, but it's also\n    strange that you'd have duplicates in the API database because the\n    Flavor.create() checks to see if all flavors have been migrated from\n    the main DB to the API DB and if not you can't create new flavors in\n    the API DB - so the only way to get the duplicates is either by inserting\n    them into the API DB manually or perhaps some other kind of race issue.\n    Anyway, that's not dealt with here.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3bdb1a8ca72c3e72ddc3bc5102cff8df18148617\n    Partial-Bug: #1653261\n",
