Rather, they confirm\n    that the various conductor APIs (public, local, rpc, and manger)\n    all agree and that the plumbing between them works as expected.\n    \n    The test_vol_usage_update() test does too much, and as a result,\n    gets all twisted in how it mucks with mox to stub out utcnow()\n    without breaking the base test harness. Unfortunately, it seems\n    to fail quite often, depending on testr ordering, and has been\n    blocking the gate quite a bit lately.\n    \n    This patch refactors that test to be like all the rest of the\n    conductor tests. It also removes the useless mirror test of\n    test_vol_usage_update_again().\n    \n    Fixes bug 1190971\n    \n    Change-Id: I815b25f6585786a8dbd5eefcfb39e2b4790641cb\n",
