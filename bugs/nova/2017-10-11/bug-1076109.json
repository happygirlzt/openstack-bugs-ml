However our call returned non working\n    urls to 1.1 versions of those documents. Fix this.\n    \n    Also fix the unit tests to actually test the output of versions.\n    Previously we were over stubbing the test_verions.py so it was\n    testing only itself, and not the output you'd actually get from\n    the real versions.py module.\n    \n    Renamed the variables used for the expected variables to reduce\n    confusion about what is an expected variable vs. the variables\n    coming from versions.py to try to ensure we don't have cicular\n    always passing tests in the future.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1076109\n    \n    Change-Id: I1047b8c48ff053eed5ad4afa8eae5833f70d0893\n",
