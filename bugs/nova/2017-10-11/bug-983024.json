    "description": "Scenario :\n========\n\nTwo hosts running nova-network process for two networks\nHostA for networkA  (say 10.0.8.0/24)\nHostB for networkB (say 10.0.9.0/24)\n\nBoth these networks are associated with a tenant (say Demo)\n\nExpected Result :\n==============\n\nWhen we launch an new VM instance, dnsmasq setup related requests from allocate_for_instance() request should go to each HostA and HostB (for networkA and networkB respectively)\n\nActual Result :\n============\ndnsmasq setup related request randomly goes to HostA or HostB\n\nAdditional Background :\n===================\n\nDuring init_host() - QuantumManager incorrectly associates self.host for all the networks, so any host associations done via \"nova-manage network modify --host\" are lost if one of the nova-network restarts. (In this case, both nova-networks are now \"owned\" by nova-network process that restarted)\n\nSo now, QuantumManager can not update dnsmasq settings correctly.",
