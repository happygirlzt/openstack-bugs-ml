The one I could refer is https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1526715 which is technically not a duplicate but where the proposal is very close to the one you wrote : https://review.openstack.org/#/c/258472/6\n\nAnyway, given it would mean the API would accept a new body argument and merging that would change the API behaviour by returning more instances, I think we would need to open a spec for that and ask for a new API microversion (see http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/process.html#overview)\n\nI'm marking that bug report as Opinion to clarify my thoughts.",

But here status = soft_deleted filter is already there in the api request and it is not working as expected. In the change that I made I am not adding a new request parameter, I am using the status filter and made the change to make it work as expected. I think this will not change the API behaviour. With this change it returns more instances(soft_deleted instances) which is expected.\n\nMay be I am missing something here. Please correct me if I am thinking wrong on when an API microversion is needed.",
