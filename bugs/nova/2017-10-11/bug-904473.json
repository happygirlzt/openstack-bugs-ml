If no such header exists, return 'text/plain'.\n    \n    The wsgiref web server has the same behavior, whereas mod_wsgi will\n    pass no content-type and twisted will pass an empty string.\n    \n    Make our code more robust by treating the empty string or text/plain\n    as if no content-type header was supplied.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ide117c807db0dc0f5cbe974788b604b5e236800a\n",
