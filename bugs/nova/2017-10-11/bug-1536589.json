    "description": "If during live migration the connection to nova conductor service is somehow lost (for instance, due to the rabbitmq server becoming unavailable), the migration status of the nodes never gets updated, and they end up forever in \"migrating\" state, with the actual guest already running on the new host, but the data in the nova database still pointing at the old host.\n\nThis happens in all versions at lest up to Mitaka.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. Create a simple setup with two hosts.\n2. Create an instance and start a live migration.\n3. Kill the rabbitmq server.\n4. Wait for the migration to finish.\n5. Bring the rabbitmq server back up.\n6. Observe the instance stuck in \"migrating\" state, with everything migrated to the new host, but Nova thinking it's still on the old host.",

Doesnt matter whether you kill live migration monitor or rabbitmq, you will end up with an instance running on destination host without networking configured correctly and with a mess on source host.\n\nI believe that https://review.openstack.org/#/c/225910/ should at least partially solve this problem. There is also proposition to make compute stateful which should solve the issue completely.",
