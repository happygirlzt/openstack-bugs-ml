Block the delete request until migration end.\nThe delete request suspend in nova-api if the instance status was MIGRATING.\n\nUmm... taskflow solve this problem more smart, maybe\n",

            "content": "Solution to this problem is a little bit different since live migration monitor has been merged. Instead of periodic task I think of monitor improvement. \n\nWhen user trigger delete of a VM that is being live migrated, live migration monitor will think that LM was eventually completed and it will call \"post_method\" on destination host (because VM disappeared from source host). Depending on scenario during post_method VM will be in DELETING state or it will not exist. This will cause exceptions on destination host and will leave things in a messy state - rollback will not be called.\n\nSo I think that this check in live_migration_monitor:\n\nif ex.get_error_code() == libvirt.VIR_ERR_NO_DOMAIN:\n                            LOG.debug(\"VM is missing, migration finished\",\n                                      instance=instance)\n                            info.type = libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_JOB_COMPLETED\n\nshould also check whether VM still exists in Nova. If not - it should set info.type to one of two: libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_JOB_FAILED or libvirt.VIR_DOMAIN_JOB_CANCELLED so that rollback will be called on destination host.\n\nAfter this fix I believe that such situation will be a corner case and will happen only if nova-compute will be restarted during LM, but this should be fixed by blueprint manager-restart-during-migration \nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/manager-restart-during-migration",
