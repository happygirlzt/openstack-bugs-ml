It makes changes to nova API\n    and\n    compute services to handle requests that do not have any image\n    supplied.\n    \n    Also it makes rescue and rebuild work with instances started from\n    volume.\n    \n    Finally the patch introduces tests to make sure the system acts as\n    expected, and in the process fixes and refactors some old tests to make\n    them test for cases this new functionality can introduce.\n    \n    This patch is intended to be a proof of concept and a first step\n    towards\n    a more cleaner interface for booting from volumes, outlined in\n    https://etherpad.openstack.org/grizzly-boot-from-volumes.\n    \n    This patch also introduces a slight modification of the nova API so I\n    am flagging it with DocImpact. The change is that if the os-volumes\n    extension is used ImageRef does not need to be supplied to the create\n    server API call provided there is block_device_mapping provided.\n    \n    Also note that this is the first step towards introducing a 'volume'\n    parameter\n    for starting instances which will replace the somewhat unintuitive\n    block_device_mapping (they will still be used but not for the boot\n    device).\n    \n    This patch is coupled with I5ba9b0f35a5084aa91eca260f46cac83b8b6591e\n    that provides changes to the nova client.\n    \n    Implements: blueprint improve-boot-from-volume\n    Fixes bug #1008622\n    \n    Change-Id: I530760cfaa5eb0cae590c7383e0840c6b3f896b9\n",
