    "description": "The metadata-api still loads pieces of nova-network even when using neutron=True.\n\nSpecifically, it is still loading linuxnet_interface_driver and it is adding in ACCEPT rules with iptables to allow the metadata port. While this may make sense with nova-network, it doesn't make sense for an api to be messing with iptables.\n\nSince neutron uses metadata-api through its proxy, it cannot be said that the metadata-api is purely a nova-network thing.\n\nThe MetadataManager class that is loaded makes note of the fact that all the class does is add that ACCEPT rule [0]. Previously in Newton I was able to work around this by overriding the MetadataManager class with 'nova.manager.Manager', that that option was removed in Ocata [1]. Now the 'nova.api.manager.MetadataManager' name is hardcoded [2] and requires modifying nova source.\n\nTL;DR when using the metadata-api, bits of nova-network are still loaded when they shouldn't be.\n\n[0] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/4f91ed3a547965ed96a22520edcfb783e7936e95/nova/api/manager.py#L24\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/stable/newton/nova/conf/service.py#L51\n\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/065cd6a8d69c1ec862e5b402a3150131f35b2420/nova/service.py#L60",

Antique remainders include the metadata server iptables thing, DHCP, and DNS.\n\nThe driver interface and API interface do not overlap however, so its not as simple as just replacing calls to one with calls to the other. Instead, we'll need to work through all the calls to the driver interface and decide what to do with them.",
