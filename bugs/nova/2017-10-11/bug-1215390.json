We also rewrite the relationship() method call to\n    make it stylistically conforming with the analogous 'service' relationship\n    in the ComputeNode class: we add the 'foreign_keys' parameter, wrap the\n    'backref' parameter into a method call and remove the auxiliary 'primary_join'\n    variable.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2b1f27b4c1d06f364af01fc82d3490fd3bbf4ac0\n    Closes-Bug: #1215390\n",
