            "content": "Eli,\n\nCan you explain why this is marked as incomplete? In my view, it is a bit misleading to present a 'Boot from Volume' option to the user when Openstack does not actually boot from the volume. In the case where the user is encrypting the volume, this presents a security vulnerability since the user will assume that they are booting from an encrypted volume when, in fact, they are booting from an unencrypted image from Nova's image cache.\n\nAs you correctly pointed out, there IS a way for the user to actually boot from a volume. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Attach a volume to an instance.\n2. scp a raw image to the instance.\n3. ssh into the instance, dd the image into the attached volume.\n4. Terminate the instance.\n5. Manually modify cinder's mysql database so that the volume is listed as bootable.\n6. Boot an instance from the volume.\n\nFrom my perspective, this is an unnecessarily laborious process for the user to perform anytime they want OpenStack to correctly boot from a volume. ",

There's no reliable way to turn a 3 part image into a self-contained image. Maybe create-volume-from-image should just refuse if it is a multi-part image?",
