As such it\n    is not required or expected to remain compatible across\n    releases.\n    \n    The main reason for its existance is for people who are\n    developing new cinder drivers, to be able to write out\n    of tree nova volume drivers. The recommended practice\n    is to instead work in-tree to nova on a branch. This is\n    an approach that would be required in order to submit\n    the work for review and eventual merge in any case.\n    \n    commit I1f884f36e24fe478922671ca3eaf6b7c21fd8a5a\n    deprecated it and during the discussion the actually target\n    is Kilo. But it's K-3 so more reasonable target is\n    Liberty.\n    \n    DocImpact: libvirt.volume_drivers config param is removed.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1371175\n    \n    Change-Id: I832820499ec3304132379ad9b9d1ee92c5a75b61\n",
