This is inefficient as aggregates\n    are not updated that often.\n    \n    This change only updates the aggregate map for any single resource\n    provider if it has not been updated in the last 300 seconds. The\n    handling of the update has been moved out to its own method (instead of\n    two calls in _ensure_resource_provider) so that if we want to move it to\n    the periodic job or something like that, that will be easy.\n    \n    When a resource provider is new to the resource tracker, we always\n    update the aggregate map for that resouce provider uuid.\n    \n    The initial pass of this used a single time for last update, instead of\n    a time per resource provider uuid, but that would lead to some\n    upredictability.\n    \n    The aggregate_refresh_map (which maps rp uuids to last update times) is\n    public so that if we want to make it so the reset() on the compute\n    manager can clear it, we have that option.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1708252\n    Change-Id: Ida7c79a3130ba1c159a37c984d382c789f46e111\n",
