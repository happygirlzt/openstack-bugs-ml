The problem is that Resource.__call__ tries to wrap all webob.exc.HTTPException subclasses in a Fault, but Fault is itself a subclass of HTTPException, and so it tries to wrap a Fault in a Fault.  This doesn't work because Fault expects its wrapped_exc to have an explanation field, but Fault itself does not.",
