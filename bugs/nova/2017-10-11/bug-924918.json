If multiple greenthreads are attempting to communicate with dom0 at once, then the outer call to _get_session() can end up with all of the sessions acquired leaving the inner calls to _get_session() waiting for one of the outer calls to release.",

This can cause a deadlock if multiple greenthreads\n    all block waiting for the outer sessions to be freed to allocate the\n    inner session. This change moves the call to get_xenapi_host() to outside\n    the with statement to ensure calls to _get_session() aren't nested.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8f5490f40a9ccaf74a276187f66519a5d5f52b2e\n",
