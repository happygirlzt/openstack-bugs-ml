    "description": "Currently `client_wrapper` doesn't specify `os_endpoint_type` when creating ironic client which defaults to 'publicURL'. This causes nova-compute to use public endpoints from catalog for ironic api access. This in turn causes problems as nova-compute nodes don't need to have public interfaces and ironic services can be running on remote nodes.",

The Adapter, and\n    its component keystoneauth1 artifacts not passed into the method, are\n    loaded based on options in the conf group corresponding to the specified\n    service_type.\n    \n    The ultimate goal is to replace the various disparate mechanisms used by\n    different services to do endpoint URL and version discovery.  In Queens,\n    the original mechanisms will still take precedence, but (other than\n    [glance]api_servers - see the spec) will be deprecated.  In Rocky, the\n    deprecated options will be removed.\n    \n    This change incorporates the above utility into endpoint discovery for\n    glance and ironic.  Future change sets will do the same for other\n    services (cinder, neutron, placement).\n    \n    Change-Id: If625411f40be0ba642baeb02950f568f43673655\n    Partial-Implements: bp use-ksa-adapter-for-endpoints\n    Closes-Bug: #1707860\n",
