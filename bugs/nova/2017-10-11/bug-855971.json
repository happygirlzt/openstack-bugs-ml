Using nova-network 2011.3~rc~20110909.r1155-0ubuntu1 , all works well. br100 is created, inherits the IP of eth0 and serves DHCP with unreserve and non-conflicting addresses.

If you want to manually reserve an ip for a host, it is insufficient to simply set it to reserved. You will need to manually associate it with the host by setting the host field in the fixed_ips table.\n\nSomething like:\n\nmysql -h $MYSQL_HOST -u $MYSQL_USER -p $MYSQL_PASS $MYSQL_DB -e \"UPDATE fixed_ips SET host=`hostname` WHERE address='$MY_IP'\"\n\nshould be sufficient.",
