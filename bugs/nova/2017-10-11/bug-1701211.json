Fixing it with microversion (for > 2.x) not needed as we are removing the networks quota from quota class.\n\nIf fix (without microversion) networks quota (get, update) based on config controlled similar to quota set (where it 400 if network quota is in request but not enabled in config), then it seems return code change (200 ->400). If config option is false then networks quota will not be registered [1]. In that case, if anyone try to update quota class with networks quota, it will at least update DB without any error [2] (ran locally)\n\n\n..1 https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/0ca64a8690ac9de720131b522d29dcaed824eb8d/nova/api/openstack/compute/tenant_networks.py#L190\n\n.. 2 https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/0ca64a8690ac9de720131b522d29dcaed824eb8d/nova/api/openstack/compute/quota_classes.py#L85-L87\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/0ca64a8690ac9de720131b522d29dcaed824eb8d/nova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py#L3468-L3485",
