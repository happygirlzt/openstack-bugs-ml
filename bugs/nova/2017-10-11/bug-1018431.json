So it is pretty reasonable that flag setting in nova.conf could generate this debug message, not only for nova-manage, but for all nova components that invokes database backend loading.\n\nAfter all, nova-manage shares the same DB layer codebase with other modules. So either nova-manage use its own database code, or... we can simply remove this debugging message for all nova components.",
