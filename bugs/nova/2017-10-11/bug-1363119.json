    "description": "Each running nova-network service periodically calls fixed_ip_disassociate_all_by_timeout(). This searches all fixed ips, filtering on multiple columns. With a large number of fixed_ips, each call to this function can take several seconds to complete. With many hosts running nova-network, a cluster with little to no activity can experience prolonged delays in message processing, eventually rendering some or all hosts unresponsive to nova commands (boot instance, etc). The only column referenced in that query that is not represented in any existing index is updated_at; a new index including fixed_ips.updated_at is probably called for.",
