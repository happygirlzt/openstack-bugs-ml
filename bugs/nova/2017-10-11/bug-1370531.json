This image will be created\n    having the according flavor size.\n    \n    In this case, due to a Win32 API issue, the image is not generated\n    properly.\n    \n    Simply creating the root image with no size specified and resizing\n    it afterwards fixes the issue.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7bb46a63d4c2a06ed6f63c839461cbbc1abffa65\n    Closes-Bug: #1370531\n",
