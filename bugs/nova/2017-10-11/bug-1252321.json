It could be easily done by examining /var/lib/nova/instances/compute_nodes files which says what compute nodes use that storage. Nova could then count only one of these nodes to have a real value.\n\nThis problem affects scheduling and nova hypervisor statistics.\n\nMaillist conversation: http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack/2013-November/002763.html",

It seems to me that any attempt to sum the disk space across all hypervisors is broken by design and we need to rethink what we're actually trying to accomplish here. Simply not double-counting NFS space is insufficient IMHO",
