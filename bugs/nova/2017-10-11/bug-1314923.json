    "description": "When using Nova bare-metal we see large disk I/O waiting on image download from Glace. This is seen when we have multiple nodes running the same images which use large amount of disk space even if the same image is used. This is especially true for the ram disk that is used for initial node boot which is common to all system images.\n\nThis is a common use case when developing in Tripleo. Even though Ironic is the target technology for Tripleo it dose not have all required features yet.",

Nova-baremetal has logic to serialise these downloads as overall throughput is higher if we're only downloading one thing at a time.  So a fairly simple fix to store the images locally by their id (rather than the instance id) and to skip the download if the image is already present has been added in:\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/87938 - root disk images (only valid if file injection is \"off\")\n\nhttps://review.openstack.org/91334 - kernel and ramdisks (always valid)",
