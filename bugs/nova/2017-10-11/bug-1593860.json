Boring IV <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jun 17 14:35:18 2016 -0700\n\n    config option: rename libvirt iscsi_use_multipath\n    \n    This patch renames the libvirt conf section entry of\n    iscsi_use_multipath to volume_use_multipath.   Both iSCSI and\n    FibreChannel libvirt volume drivers use this value to determine\n    if multipath volume attachments are to be used.  It's an n-cpu system\n    wide value that's not specific to iSCSI.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iebbac91a74df468d5be9b2e70560d5b4394ce595\n    Closes-Bug: #1593860\n",
