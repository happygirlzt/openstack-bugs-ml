It should change to a deleting state.\n\nhttp://docs.openstack.org/cactus/openstack-compute/developer/openstack-compute-api-1.1/content/Delete_Server-d1e2883.html\n\nAccording to the specification, there is no \"deleting\" state. What is happening right now when you delete an active VM is this:\n\nvm_state: ACTIVE\ntask_state: None\n\nDELETE /v1.1/my_project/servers/1\n\nvm_state: ACTIVE\ntask_state: DELETING\n\nThe OpenStack API doesn't know to display this any differently than ACTIVE, so ACTIVE is displayed. \n\nI would be 100% for updating the spec to display DELETING, but I feel like that's a 'big' discussion.\n\n\n\n>> I've also noticed it will flip to ACTIVE when in a BUILD or ERROR state after deleting the instance.\n\nHmm, this certainly shouldn't happen. I'll look into reproducing this now.",

I can't get it to show ACTIVE when deleting. Can you give steps to reproduce?\n\n",
