The refactored code would\n    have only worked if a list of host names (strings) were passed in to\n    host_manager's get_filtered_hosts().  Unfortunately that's what the unit\n    tests tested, but the real caller (filter_scheduler) actually passes a\n    list of HostState class instances.\n    \n    Unit tests are fixed to pass HostStates and the offending code in the\n    host_manager has been fixed.\n    \n    Change-Id: I54a3385da7c095e8ddf26b7536d46a9ee4072a58\n",
