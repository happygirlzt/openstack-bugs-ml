    "description": "Right now, LVM backed instances can be scrubbed (overwritten with zeros using dd) upon deletion.  However, there is no such option with file backed images.  While it is true that fallocate can handle some of this by returning 0s to the instance when reading any unwritten parts of the file, there are some cases where it is not desirable to enable fallocate.\n\nWhat would be preferred would be a similar the options cinder has implemented, so the operator can choose to shred or zero out the file, based on their organizations own internal data policies.   A zero out option satisfies those that must ensure they scrub tenant data upon deletion, and shred would satisfy those beholden to DoD 5220-22.\n\nThis would of course make file backed disks vulnerable to https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/889299 but that might not be a bad thing considering its quite old.\n\nAttached an initial patch for nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py that performs the same LVM zero scrub routine to disk backed files, however it lacks any flags to enable or disable it right now.",

However, the encrypted disk work that's been coming in, especially if there is a per instance generated key, means the data is useless if someone goes and physically removes the server from the cluster. So my $0.02 would be focus on the encrypted data path instead.",
