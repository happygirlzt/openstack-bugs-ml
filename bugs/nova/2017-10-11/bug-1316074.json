For this to work and to prohibit\n    future DB access from happening, the objects indirection API is set\n    and DB access is blocked in a similar way to how it is done in\n    nova-compute and nova-network.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5e3152aad13343a6a1ecd9b5b511429159c9d4c2\n    Closes-Bug: #1316074\n",
