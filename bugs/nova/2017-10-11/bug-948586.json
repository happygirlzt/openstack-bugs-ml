Deleted instances did not have the\n    backref to info_cache available. The api would then go to network to get\n    the info, but since the network structures had already been torn down,\n    there was nothing to return. The bug then is that network_info at time\n    of instance deletion was expected to be accessible through the\n    instance['info_cache'].\n    \n    Change-Id: I8ce6ce92e2abe6241d408192ced9526562e978db\n",
