    "description": "The libvirt driver caches the output of mkfs and mkswap in the image cache. One consequence of this is that all ephemeral disks of a particular size and format on a single compute will have the same UUID. The same applies to swap disks. These identifiers are intended to be universally unique, but they are not.\n\nThis is unlikely to be an issue in practise for ephemeral disks, as they will never be shared, however it is a wart.",
