Neutron API does not define a format\n    for this field, or whether or not it will be specified on the port,\n    and if so, if it's an empty dict or None, so let's be safe and\n    make sure we handle None.\n    \n    Because of how many places we access the binding:profile on\n    a port, this adds a common helper utility.\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Eric M Gonzalez <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I564bac88fad6cc47ccbf7425b1ab39899fdc1c2e\n    Closes-Bug: #1717365\n",
