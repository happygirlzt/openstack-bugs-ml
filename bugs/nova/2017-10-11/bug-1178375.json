This was somewhat\n    mitigated by change to use a single reply queue.  This meant we created\n    far fewer direct exchanges, but the problem persists anyway.\n    \n    A Qpid expert, William Henry, originally proposed a change to address\n    this issue.  Unfortunately, it wasn't backwards compatible with existing\n    installations.  This patch takes the same approach, but makes it\n    optional and off by default.  This will allow a migration period.\n    \n    As a really nice side effect, the Qpid experts have told us that this\n    change will also allow us to use Qpid broker federation to provide HA.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes-bug: #1178375\n    Co-authored-by: William Henry <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I09b8317c0d8a298237beeb3105f2b90cb13933d8\n",

            "content": "There appears to be a problem with this patch.  It introduces a change in messaging behavior that I think is a bug.\n\nI've found a problem while testing my port of this fix to oslo.messaging (see link in previous comment for review).\n\nThe problem that I'm seeing is that RPC messages sent to a topic that has more than one server is no longer having the RPC request be serviced by only one server.  Instead, this patch causes the RPC request to be multicast to _all_ servers - basically it now acts like a fanout.\n\nHere's exactly what I'm seeing.  I've built a simple RPC server and client test tool (see https://github.com/kgiusti/oslo-messaging-clients), which can select between the two topology versions via command line switch.\n\nIf I run two servers using topology version 1 on topic \"my-topic\", like this:\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-server.py --topology=1 server01 &\nRunning server, name=server01 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 1\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-server.py --topology=1 server02 &\n[ Running server, name=server02 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 1\n\nAnd if I then invoke a single RPC call via a client, I see only one of the servers get the RPC request.  Each time I invoke the RPC client, the request is \"round-robined\" across the servers:\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Sat Nov 16 08:50:39 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nserver02::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Sat Nov 16 08:50:45 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-client.py --topology=1 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Sat Nov 16 08:50:50 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\n\nHowever, if I repeat the above using topology=1, both servers get a copy of the RPC request and service it:\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-server.py --topology=2 server02 &\n Running server, name=server02 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 2\n\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-server.py --topology=2 server01 &\nRunning server, name=server01 exchange=my-exchange topic=my-topic namespace=my-namespace\nUsing QPID topology version 2\n\nNow invoke the client once:\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ ./my-client.py --topology=2 my-topic methodB arg1 arg2\n\nAnd both servers respond:\n(py27)[kgiusti@t530 work (master)]$ server02::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Sat Nov 16 08:52:22 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\nserver01::TestEndpoint02::methodB( ctxt={'application': u'my-client', 'cast': None, 'time': u'Sat Nov 16 08:52:22 2013'} arg={u'arg1': u'arg2'} ) called!!!\n\nClearly a change in behavior, and, per my noob understanding of the RPC implementation, a bug.\n",

This was somewhat\n    mitigated by change to use a single reply queue.  This meant we created\n    far fewer direct exchanges, but the problem persists anyway.\n    \n    A Qpid expert, William Henry, originally proposed a change to address\n    this issue.  Unfortunately, it wasn't backwards compatible with existing\n    installations.  This patch takes the same approach, but makes it\n    optional and off by default.  This will allow a migration period.\n    \n    As a really nice side effect, the Qpid experts have told us that this\n    change will also allow us to use Qpid broker federation to provide HA.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes-bug: #1178375\n    Co-authored-by: William Henry <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I09b8317c0d8a298237beeb3105f2b90cb13933d8\n",

That's fine where it is for the topic with server name appended, but *not* when it is for the topic itself, when it needs to in fact be a shared subscription between all servers on the topic.\n\nSee https://review.openstack.org/59677 also, which changes the setting of link name for topology 1. Doing the same thing in  topology 2 (or better, pulling the line that conditionally sets the link name into the common path) would fix the problem as described by Ken.",
