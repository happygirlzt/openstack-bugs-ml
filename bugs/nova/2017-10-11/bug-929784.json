Setting them all to zero puts Qpid in a mode\n    where it will reconnect in a busy loop.  By not setting these unless a\n    non-zero value has been provided, Qpid goes back to its default\n    behavior, which is to use an exponential backoff on reconnect attempts\n    (after 1 second, then 2, 4, 8, etc).\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia587bbe96db9ea6e429af289c3d586f4c6706648\n",
