Unfortunately, doesn't account for root VDIs which are created implicitly by glance-plugin dropping a new VHD into the SR.\n\nThe solution is to modify the glance-plugin (or the compute-calling code) to add the other config.\n\nFor a cleanup script, we can populate VDI's that are missing this data by finding the sibling 'swap' VDI, and copying that info into the root VDI (changing disk type from swap to root).\n\n\nThings to account for:\n\n* Thin-provisioned images, does the `use_cow` path handle this?\n* Bit-torrented images\n* Snapshotted images",

This patch updates the code so that `other_config` is also set\n    when a VDI is created from a dom0 plugin or during a migration.\n    \n    Also included is a one-time script to set the other_config for existing\n    VDIs that were affected by this bug.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1162029\n    \n    Change-Id: I4fa856754487f77ce9c8e39d45eee7ea5187123e\n",
