However, the new code does not ignore and compare the given specs with capability and returns  the result.\n\n- For <in> operation, if no required word follows an <in>, it crashes.

For example, if\n    \"<or> gpu <or>\" is given in extra_specs, current code tries to pop a\n    word after the second <or> that causes a crash. This patch lets it\n    ignore the \"<or>\" keyword if no word follows the second \"<or>\" keyword.\n    \n    Debugged bug 1038979\n    \n    Change-Id: I80a6eafd7ee57a2f3ccbf2fb869655ab84e92cf2\n",
