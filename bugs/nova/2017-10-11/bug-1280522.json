One SEND connection is heartbeat\n    thread + some network activity every n second. So, we can reduce it.\n    \n    Here is two ways to implement an expiration:\n    \n     [1] Create a separated thread for checking expire date of connections\n     [2] Make call expire() on pool.get() or pool.put()\n    \n    The [1] has some threading overhead, but probably insignificant\n    because the thread can sleep 99% time and wake up every 20 mins (by default).\n    Anyway current implementation is [2].\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie8781d10549a044656824ceb78b2fe2e4f7f8b43\n\ncommit 9ed95bbdc979f8fd5a21469ea3e4866b6d522cfe\nAuthor: yan.haifeng <email address hidden>\nDate:   Wed Jul 20 14:05:48 2016 +0800\n\n    Fix parameters of assertEqual are misplaced\n    \n    Many assertEqual sentences don't follow assertEqual(expected, actual),\n    These misplaces have 2 impacts:\n    1, giving confusing messages when some tests failed.\n    2, mislead other developers, new test modules may follow these wrong pattern.\n    \n    This patch fix all of them.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icc6e404dd02fe47b76c7366d31d91c8d8e464f54\n    Closes-Bug: #1604213\n\ncommit 95d04028747b1f335ef52d5b204f10e7a10ab023\nAuthor: Edu Alcaniz <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 5 12:34:03 2016 +0200\n\n    Fix misstyping issue\n    \n    Change-Id: I5f6ed9e021c2f218046ea6fed55e58018b595392\n\ncommit d1cbca851b1ef9d099a22d9c58a35165710687c8\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 19 15:19:58 2016 +0000\n\n    Updated from global requirements\n    \n    Change-Id: I7e0a79888c46869c6b7deeda7e7aaeb877c8873d\n\ncommit 73b3286eee2fb01a2bae427681ca6d71ab955224\nAuthor: OpenStack Proposal Bot <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 15 03:46:40 2016 +0000\n\n    Updated from global requirements\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib89194bdf72da24309f398016b73ee9d67885c39\n\ncommit ff9b4bb938dcc7cdd8c7fa4d2fe716f4c33a9ca6\nAuthor: Julien Danjou <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 1 17:06:09 2016 +0200\n\n    notify: add a CLI tool to manually send notifications\n    \n    Change-Id: I01ebd8402e322c5c27dc2fc4c61fb5beb2dddae8\n\ncommit 538c84b300d8d941d07d600303ad6c75d9e08a99\nAuthor: Joshua Harlow <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 12 11:06:55 2016 -0700\n\n    Add deprecated relnote for max_retries rabbit configuration option\n    \n    Change-Id: I3e7fbededc972c5c785c037e2abd7ccff0aae267\n\ncommit ae1123e438ef0c3a1abe427afe3ed1c4c5e727be\nAuthor: Oleksii Zamiatin <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 12 15:17:27 2016 +0300\n\n    [zmq] Add py34 configuration for functional tests\n    \n    Change-Id: I6bd94323d88ce9123776b1359696fbc2e31933de\n    Closes-Bug: #1602234\n\ncommit 07187f9bacd44480b45a06a97d5d42aebad19a64\nAuthor: Gevorg Davoian <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 12 18:42:45 2016 +0300\n\n    [zmq] Merge publishers\n    \n    This patch merges small logically related publishers supporting\n    only some messaging patterns into bigger ones supporting all\n    messaging patterns at once.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic47e4d89166dd14f8a67101e666dc780a1ccb2a8\n\ncommit 8e778658e527b760cfd6b95063b16b356d3bac07\nAuthor: ChangBo Guo(gcb) <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Jul 12 16:35:36 2016 +0800\n\n    Add Python 3.5 classifier and venv\n    \n    Now that there is a passing gate job, we can claim support for\n    Python 3.5 in the classifier.
