            "content": "Ok, I can see at least one race condition and a leak in the current version of the nbd code (nova/virt/disk/mount/nbd.py). They are:\n\n - the leak is: we check to see if there is a pid associated with a nbd device file. If there is we remove the device from the list of possible devices that we can use. We never re-add it. This is the bug that this bug was originally intended to track and was found the other day by Robert Collins and I. I am working on a patch for this problem now. The attack vector here is that a _local_ user could consume all the nbd devices for a short time which coincides with nova attempting to use nbd, and then nbd is broken for nova until it is restarted.\n\n - the race is: we check that a pid doesn't exist for a nbd device file. We then execute qemu using that device file, and then declare success when there is a pid associated with the device file. However -- we never check that the pid associated is the pid we created. This means someone else could be providing something which we think is qemu but is something else. I guess this could be a disk image or something like that, but I'm not too sure what attack would be meaningful here.\n\nI find none of these attacks individually too concerning, but I want to see what people think before I send of a series of reviews to resolve them.",

This meant we \"leaked\" devices\n    away over time if we were competing with other nbd users on the\n    machine.\n    \n    Instead of tracking our use at all, we should rely on the presence of\n    a user pid in /sys.\n    \n    Resolves bug 1088083.\n    \n    Change-Id: If777e270a0dda12034ea7ef1bc7fd688cadde8a9\n",
