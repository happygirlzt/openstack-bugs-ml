Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Fri Jul 25 12:41:53 2014 +0100\n\n    compute: tweaks to vm_mode APIs to align with arch/hvtype\n    \n    Rename the 'name' method to 'canonicalize' to make its purpose\n    clearer. Also add a 'is_valid' method to check validity without\n    doing canonicalization. Make it use a specialized exception\n    class instead of the generic 'Invalid' class.\n    \n    Related-bug: #1348629\n    Change-Id: I4bb972aeafb69be594bff40eded3cfeec22f0bef\n",

These drivers use the native\n    ABI for their architecture, so should be reporting 'hvm' as\n    the vm mode, which indicates an unmodified native OS ABI.\n    \n    On the other side, the ImagePropertiesFilter will canonicalize\n    the hvtype it fetches from image metadata, so that 'baremetal'\n    gets remapped to 'hvm' during comparison.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1348629\n    Change-Id: Ibda7c5ab0759aee672870d84974ccdea25f14407\n",
