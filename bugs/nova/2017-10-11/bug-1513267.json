    "description": "[Impact]\nThe file \"network_data.json\" is not found in the folder \"openstack/2015-10-15/\" of config drive.\n\nThe result is that network_data metadata doesn't work on Liberty.\n\n[Testcase]\nOn liberty, launch an instance with a configuration drive:\ne.g. nova boot --config-drive=true\n\nThe network_data.json will be available in the metadata.\n\nInside the instance, this should be expected to provide output:\n  $ sudo isoinfo -i /dev/sr0 -R -J -l | grep network_data.json\n\nOr\n  $ mkdir mp; sudo mount /dev/sr0 mp; find mp | grep network_data.json\n\n[Regression]\nThe regression potential is minimal.  The fix has already landed in Mitaka and cherry-picked patch required no code changes for Liberty.",
