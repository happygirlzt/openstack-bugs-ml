I agree that it's a bigger problem, according to trace log, the exception are thrown from other python packages.\n\nIt worth to do more investigation for the second type issues, but I must say that it's out the bug's, which I'm working on, scope, we'd better open another bug for it.  Please let me know your opinion.\n\nFurthermore, is unicode instance adminPass really supported in real user scenarios? I haven't received this kind issue feedback from users",
