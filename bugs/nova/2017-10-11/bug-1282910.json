But system_metadata of instance is not updated ('network_allocated' is not\nset to False). We should also update system_metadata after network is deleted from VM.\n\nWhile allocating network to instance we set system_metadata 'network_allocated' as True, but while deallocating network we do not set 'network_allocated'\nto False.",
