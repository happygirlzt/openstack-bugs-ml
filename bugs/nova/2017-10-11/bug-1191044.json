The lack of a network is not a sign of something wrong with\n    nova so a warning log is too much. Move to debug instead.\n    \n    This should help reduce the amount of warnings that occur on every\n    tempest run.\n    \n    Also drop the exclamation mark.\n    \n    Change-Id: I6bc4e46aa5a72645c72f7232627c7aa9efd2591d\n    Related-Bug: #1191044\n",
