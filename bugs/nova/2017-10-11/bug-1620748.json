This was workign\n    okay but the associated message was displaying stringified sets\n    of resource class ids, and not the resource classes names.\n    \n    This changes joins the sets into strings for both resource classes\n    and provider uuids and turns the class indexes into their names.\n    A functional test which was checking for the exception has been\n    updated to also check the exception's message.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ife38220da1069ffb6da26a4f8e3b954f0dc12f13\n    Closes-Bug: #1620748\n",
