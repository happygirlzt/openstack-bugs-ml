This API is used by Horizon, which is how we found this.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1)  Create an instance, say small\n\n2) resize the instance, something like large etc\n\n3) Make this call (adjust to hit a recent date etc):\nnova --debug usage --start 2015-12-01 --tenant XYZ\n\nDoing that call, we see the VCPU count reflect the old size for the instance.   This makes horizon quota and usage calculations display the wrong info, and prevents users from getting work done.",
