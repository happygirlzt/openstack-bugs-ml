It specifies the\n    cell type as \u201capi\u201d or \u201ccompute\u201d. However, when creating a cell\n    using \u201cnova-manage\u201d the cell type \u201cparent\u201d or \u201cchild\u201d is expected.\n    \n    This patch changes \u201cnova-manage\u201d to accept the cell type \u201capi\u201d and\n    \u201ccompute\u201d. Cell type \u201cparent\u201d and \u201cchild\u201d are still accepted.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes-Bug: #1414480\n    \n    Change-Id: Icc0cba4f4d56911a65d586cbc0cfdb904ecc15ba\n",
