    "description": "When executing a pagination query a \"next\" link is included in the API reply when there are more items then the specified limit.\n\nSee pagination documentation for more information: http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/Paginated_Collections-d1e664.html\n\nThe caller should be able to invoke the \"next\" link (without having to re-format it) in order to get the next page of data. The documentation states \"Subsequent links will honor the initial page size. Thus, a client may follow links to traverse a paginated collection without having to input the marker parameter.\"\n\nThe problem is that the \"next\" link is always scoped to the non-detailed query for flavors and images. For example, if you execute \"/v2/<tenant>/flavors/detail?limit=1\", the \"next\" link does not have the URL for a detailed query and is formatted as \"/v2/<tenant>/flavors?limit=1&marker=<marker>\". In this case the \"next\" link needs to be scoped to \"/v2/<tenant>/flavors/detail\".\n\nBug 1299247 fixed this for servers only. This bug is for the other nova APIs, specifically flavors and images.",
