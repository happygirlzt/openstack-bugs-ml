Horizon warns on project delete for projects with active instances, but allows it (upon confirm)\n2. Keystone notification driver sends notification out to the Queue regarding the project delete\n3. Nova listens for these notifications and acts upon them in a configurable manner, doing one of the following:\n    - deleting all instances in the project\n    - migrating instances on the deleted project to another project\n    - nothing\n\nIt seems to make sense to do the bulk of the processing within Nova. Attempting to have Horizon delete a non-trivial number of VMs as part of project delete could take a considerable amount of time (imagine deleting a project with thousands of VMs!).",

If none exists, what do you do, fallback to methods 1 or 3?\n\nI suggest that Horizon has a warning dialog, and deleting a project deletes all resources owned by that project.

Migrating and other kind of things causes problems and deleting them all is also a bit risky when it's a big project, so the best course of action should be to keep those resources as is.
