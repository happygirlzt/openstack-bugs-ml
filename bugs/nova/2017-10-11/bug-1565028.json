It doesn't capture explicit attach/detach port events.\n\nFor example:\n\n  neutron port-create test-net  # id is ee486fc1-0919-4109-9990-a2f21b25fec7\n  nova interface-attach server-1 --port-id ee486fc1-0919-4109-9990-a2f21b25fec7\n\nThe events received are port.update.end. For attaching, the device_owner and device_id are changed, although there's no indication of the reason for the update event.\n\nFor detach it's even worse because we don't even know what the port was previously attached to. Not sure here what the right answer is; a detach/attach event would be ideal.",

I don't see a cleaner option though. Ideally nova would send out a notification as it does for volume attach. ",

Since it does the same thing for volume events it wouldn't be unusual.\n\nSince neutron sends a port.update notification that only includes the current state, it's not possible to determine the reason for the update or what the port was previously attached to in the case of a detach; arguably the neutron events could be more explicit but that's a discussion i can have with the neutron team.",

So while I think that you have a perfectly good proposal here, there is a chance that it might be neglected in nova's bug database, mostly by being shadowed by other items of higher priority.\n\nHowever, I'd say having such a report for nova is certainly beneficial for achieving alignment with the Searchlight project and keeping track of the progress, though I'm far from an expert on this issue.",
