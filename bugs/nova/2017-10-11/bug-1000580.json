The fix is to do this\n    only when a new device is created. The check for a new device was\n    already being performed however the IP address was being set outside\n    that check. That's being corrected here, minor fix.\n    \n    bug 1000580\n    \n    Change-Id: I45215a3ca87a32ef4c2a2f76bab9b743eabb525e\n",
