    "description": "Hi All,\n\nI am implementing the blueprint: xenapi-provider-firewall ( https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/xenapi-provider-firewall )  and on my way to testing it I found the api calls fairly broken:\n\n    a.    remove_external_address_block returned 'OK' on removing blocks which didn't exist. \n    b.    block_external_addresses raised exception earlier on duplicate network blocks. It should be returning a 'failed' status message.\n    c.  On successful call, a dictionary is returned with msg=OK, so on an unsuccessful call, it should return a dictionary with a failed status message. This part needs to be implemented for the provider apis.\n    d. say, I block  ' 10.10.10.11/24'.   In db the value will be '10.10.10.11/24'  but in iptables it will be  ' 10.10.10.0/24'.  This behavior should be changed to keep the value in sync i.e. 10.10.10.0/24   both in db and iptables,  otherwise it gets really confusing.\n\nI am planning to post the fix for this along with the provider firewall blueprint implementation.\n\nPlease let know if anybody has any comments.",

Provides dom0 IPtables driver to implement the Provider firewall rules.\n      2. Existing libvirt code has been refactored to reduce the amount of duplicated code to a minimum\n      3. The three provider apis in ec2/admin.py file are now fixed the following way:\n        a.    remove_external_address_block returned 'OK' on removing blocks which didn't exist. This is now fixed.\n        b.    block_external_addresses raised exception earlier on duplicate network blocks. Now the exception is logged and failed status message is returned.\n        c.  all the three provider apis now logs for invalid and improper inputs and return uniform (a dictionary ) and proper status messages for all cases.\n      4. appropriate unit tests added to cover the same\n    \n    Change-Id: I27d83186f850423a6268947aed0c9a349d8f8d65\n",
