This is not the primary concern of this bug, as this should be handled by the bug I filed with Glance (lp:975483).\n\nMy primary concern is that we are not gating changes correctly as OpenStack Jenkins is happily telling everyone that Nova unittests are passing when it should not be.\n\nSolutions: Ensure Jenkins always runs the equivalent of:\n\n$ ./run_tests.sh -V -s -f\n\nOr at least update a venv once a day?\n\nLong story short, unittests should always pass for someone checking out the project, wasn't that a goal of gating?\n\nShould this be a bug in the openstack-ci project?",
