I have attached log files to show the latest test. the tap interface are created with same name on multiple hosts like shown here:\n\nHost-1:\nubuntu@ip-192-168-0-10:~$ ifconfig tapcaba1b94-47\ntapcaba1b94-47 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr c6:be:57:50:ba:93  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::c4be:57ff:fe50:ba93/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:2 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:500 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n\nHost-2:\nubuntu@ip-192-168-0-11:~$ ifconfig tapcaba1b94-47\ntapcaba1b94-47 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr a6:07:7c:bc:ce:e7  \n          inet6 addr: fe80::a407:7cff:febc:cee7/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:9 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:8 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:500 \n          RX bytes:1467 (1.4 KB)  TX bytes:648 (648.0 B)",
