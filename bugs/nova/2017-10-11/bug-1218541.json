And if so, does re-starting XAPI repopulate the storage and monitoring settings?",

After execute xe-toolstack-restart the storage network continue down.\n\nIf I set script to start on boot (chkconfig openvswitch-nova on) the storage network ping tiny time and goes down. These is the same happen with the management network before fix the bonding problem. \n\nThe results are: the reboot and the re-starting XAPI not repopulate the storage and monitoring network traffic.",
