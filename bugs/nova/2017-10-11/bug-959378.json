    "description": "In linux_net:get_dhcp_leases and get_dhcp_hosts two db requests are made for every running instance in the db. The implication is that 2 * instances queries are made every time an instance is launched or terminated.\n\nUltimately this code needs to be refactored to just send in the relevant information to linux_net The information seems to be:\nnetwork_id\ninstance_hostname\ninstance_host\nfixed_ip_address\nvif_address\ninstance_id (could probably use hostname in place of this)\n\nThis is too large of a change for essex though so I think we need something like the following:\n\na) use joins to load the instance and vif in the db.network_get_associated_fixed_ips query (only used in linux_net)\n\nb) optionally pass in a host parameter to filter the query",
