    "description": "Nova currently provides nameserver information in network_data.json as a globally-scoped \"services\" key.  E.g., from https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/liberty/implemented/metadata-service-network-info.html#rest-api-impact:\n\n  {\n  \"links\": [...],\n  \"networks\": [...],\n  \"services\": [\n      {\n          \"type\": \"dns\",\n          \"address\": \"8.8.8.8\"\n      },\n      {\n          \"type\": \"dns\",\n          \"address\": \"8.8.4.4\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n\nThis is problematic because nameserver information is actually provided to OpenStack *per-subnet*, and nameservers that are reachable via one subnet may not be reachable from others.  This is true outside of OpenStack as well, and is generally handled by providing nameserver information in interface configuration files (such as /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 on RHEL and derivatives).\n\nUnfortunately, because Nova does not provide interface-scoped nameserver information, it is not possible to correctly configure a server from this information.  Depending on how /etc/resolv.conf is populated, this can result in name resolution delays or failures if some system interfaces are brought down.\n\nWhile it may be too late to remove the global nameserver information, we should *also* provide interface-scoped nameserver information in the \"networks\" dictionary, something like:\n\n  \"networks\": [\n    {\n      \"network_id\": \"100dc63c-e8f8-46d1-a99f-6da4aca171b1\",\n      \"type\": \"ipv4\",\n      \"netmask\": \"255.255.255.0\",\n      \"link\": \"tap14c7fd7d-81\",\n      \"routes\": [\n        {\n          \"netmask\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n          \"network\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n          \"gateway\": \"10.9.8.1\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"ip_address\": \"10.9.8.2\",\n      \"id\": \"network1\",\n      \"services\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"dns\",\n          \"address\": \"10.9.8.1\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n\nThis would allow system configuration tools to correctly configure interface-scoped nameserver information.",
