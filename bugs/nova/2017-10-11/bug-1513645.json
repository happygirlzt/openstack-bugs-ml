As long as there is no actual observation that this is\na failure/fault/error in the behavior of Nova it doesn't make sense \nto open a bug report from my point of view. Pointing to master code\nwhich is constantly evolving doesn't help too. If you have concerns\nthat some use cases could be affected it's fair to add test cases to\ntempest to ensure that the use cases in doubt get tested properly.",
