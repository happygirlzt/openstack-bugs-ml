In EC2, most\n    resources are able to be tagged.  See\n    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html\n    \n    In openstack, the only currently 'taggable' resource is an instance, as\n    it has an instance_metadata table associated.  So far, only instance\n    tagging has been implemented, but it is relatively simple to extend this\n    to other resource types by creating the associated model and api calls.\n    \n    Additionally, in EC2 searches, shell-style globs are allowed, eg:\n    fo* will match fo, foo, foobar\n    fo? will match foo\n    \n    This has been left to do at a later date.\n    \n    DocImpact: Adds new API calls: CreateTags, DeleteTags, DescribeTags\n    See:\n    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-CreateTags.html\n    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DeleteTags.html\n    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/ApiReference-query-DescribeTags.html\n    \n    Fixes: bug #1096821\n    Implements: blueprint ec2-tags-api\n    \n    Change-Id: Idf1108f6a3476cabdbdb32ff41c00aa4bc2d9ffe\n    Signed-off-by: Stephen Gran <email address hidden>\n",
