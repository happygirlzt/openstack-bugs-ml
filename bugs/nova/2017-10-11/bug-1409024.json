    "description": "2 simultaneous calls to DNSDomain.register_for_zone or DNSDomain.register_for_project will race. The winner is undefined. Consequently, the caller has no way of knowing if the DNSDomain is appropriately registered following a call. register_for_zone or register_for_project will not currently generate an error in this case.\n\nI can think of 2 ways to resolve this:\n\n1. Assert that only an unregistered domain can be registered. Attempting to register a registered domain is an error. This would be a semantic change to the existing APIs.\n\n2. Create new APIs which additionally take the expected current registration, and fail if it is not as expected. Deprecate the existing APIs.\n\nI favour the former.",
