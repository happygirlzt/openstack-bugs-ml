The ideal was\n    to fall back to querying the network IP in case the cache was busted.\n    \n    However, reality says this case is extremely common as it is the case\n    when instances are freshly built and haven't had network info assigned\n    yet.  The calls to network API are expensive and goes against the whole\n    idea of this \"cache\".\n    \n    So, this patch removes the fallback to querying the network API.  In its\n    place, it adds a periodic task to the compute manager to periodically\n    sync the cache entry.\n    \n    Since I had to fix a number of tests, I consolidated some things there\n    as well with regards to instance stubbing.\n    \n    Change-Id: I493f811bcba4e99ac6a5756bcab473557d5c0104\n",
