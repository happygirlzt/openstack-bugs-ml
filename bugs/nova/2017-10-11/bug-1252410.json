    "description": "When booting an instance with a network that has no defined subnets (i.e. you want the instance to have a network interface but not to have the address range managed by neutron), the nova/neutron integration code throws a SecurityGroupCannotBeApplied exception. At the moment, nova does not have the ability to indicate that no SecurityGroup is required (omitting it results in the default group being assumed). \n\nTo reproduce:\n\n1. create a network -- do not create a subnet!\n2. boot a vm a-la \"nova boot --image foo --nic net-id=[uuid for aforementioned network] foovm\"\n\nResult: \nVM fails to boot, enters ERROR state",
