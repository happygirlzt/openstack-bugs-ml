Due to this when multiple n-api nodes are setup in a multinode environment, only one entry is\ncreated for nova-osapi_compute and nova-metadata services in nova.services table.\n\nThis doesn't have any effect when n-api's on both nodes have same version. But when n-api on node 1 is upgraded, then n-api on node2 refuses to start due to Service version too Old exception.\nThis behavior can be changed by having two entries for these services in db.\n\nSteps to reproduce\n==================\n\n1. Setup multinode devstack environment with all controller services on one node and n-api & n-cpu on another node.\n2. Now you have two n-api nodes.\n3. Check nova.services table.\n\nExpected result\n===============\n\nThere should be two entries for nova-osapi_compute and nova-metadata services in nova.services table one for each host. \n\nActual result\n=============\n\nOnly one entry created for these services.",
