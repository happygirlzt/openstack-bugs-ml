It's a dict while creating a server from a image\n    2. It's a empty string while creating a server from a volume\n    \n    We should modify the type to dict, otherwise someone who call\n    the api will be confused about the value or can't parse the value\n    in the same way.\n    \n    The patch just modifies the v3 api.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0d7ce59f64adec0933353af58dc5b5170390674b\n    Closes-Bug: #1262039\n",
