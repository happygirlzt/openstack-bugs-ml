If \"accessible_private_ip\" existed, then it could try that out too if no public IP is available. (It also uses some recognized private IP ranges to \"test\" if they are private).\n\nThe other reason for this request is that I find it confusion to use the label public_ip on a 172.x.x.x range on a private intranet-only cloud infrastructure (for example).",

It might also be beneficial to start a mailing list thread on this and get some additional eyes. A bug report is not really appropriate for what you are wanting which is a change in intended behavior.",
