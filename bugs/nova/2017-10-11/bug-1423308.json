    "description": "Cisco Nexus1000V supports binding ports using 'vemctl' script. However, support for this script was missing in nova and neutron. This proposed fix is to change Nova to properly set up port bindings via 'n1kv' vif driver during port creation. Lack of this may cause issues with Nexus1000V deployments going forward.\nThe corresponding neutron change for n1kv interface driver will be pushed up separately.",
