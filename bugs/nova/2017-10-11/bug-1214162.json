    "description": "The dhcp_options_enabled is currently set to False because the neutron extra_dhcp_opts patches have not landed yet. This should land in the Havana release of Neutron, as such dhcp_options_enabled option can then be defaulted to True or the conditional in the code can be removed (the desired approach). This is explained in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/31061/, and in Neutron: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30441/ and https://review.openstack.org/#/c/30447/, for the python-neutronclient. So for Icehouse release of Nova this option should be removed and the code modified to support the dhcp_options.",
