Essentially authorization is wrapped up in the token returned by Nova, not Horizon.\n\nThere could be a feature request to provide token revocation which Horizon could use on logout though.",

It should be noted that it's possible to access the console without Horizon and Nova controls the lifetime of that access.\n\nI think there are some improvements that can be made around how this is handled, but I wouldn't classify it as a security issue.",
