    "description": "M2Crypto has been effectively abandoned by upstream. Bugs/patches are not being worked on or accepted, no code has gone in to the repo in over a year and direct messages to the maintainer go unanswered.\n\nWith that in mind, it would be great if we stopped depending on it. The current setup.py bug is minor, but if something larger comes up in the future we don't have much recourse - and our use of it right now is small.",
