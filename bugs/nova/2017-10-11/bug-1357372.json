Although the get_vnc_port function has a lock it not guarantee that the whole vnc port allocation process is locked, so another instance could receive the same port if it requests the VNC port before nova has finished the vnc port allocation to another VM.\n\nIf the instances with the same VNC port are allocated in same host it could lead to a improper access to the instance console.\n\nReproduce the problem: Launch  two or more instances at same time. In some cases one instance could execute the get_vnc_port and pick a port but before this instance has finished the _set_vnc_config another instance could execute get_vnc_port and pick the same port. \n\nHow often this occurs: unpredictable.",
