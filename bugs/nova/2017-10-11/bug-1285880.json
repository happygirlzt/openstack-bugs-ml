    "description": "Currently there is a force_config_drive config item for each compute node.  A VM migrated from host w/ force_config_drive  to a host w/o it will lost the config_drive, this is not so good. Currently it's ok because most of the config drive information is only used at launch time.\n\nAccording to the comments , it's be better to be based on image property. \n\nOne thing need consider is rebuild. A image is changed when rebuilding, and I think if new image has no property for config drive, there should be no config drive for it. Thus we have to distinguish between the config_drive requirement from user and from image property.",
