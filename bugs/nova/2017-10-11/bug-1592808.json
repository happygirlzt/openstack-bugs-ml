If property string is unicode we shouldn't convert it\n    to str.\n    \n    2. kernel_id and ramdisk_id are custom properties and for\n    this reason they have to be processed on 'properties' layer\n    and not with regular attributes.\n    \n    3. In glance v1 it was possible to set empty string to\n    kernel_id and ramdisk_id properties. In glance v2 it's\n    forbidden and that's why we have to convert them to\n    None values.\n    \n    Change-Id: I950777c5d0292b4a54d14913611038a18ef41d57\n    Closes-bug: #1592808\n",
