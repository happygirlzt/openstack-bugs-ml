Boring IV <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu May 12 14:59:29 2016 -0700\n\n    Don't check cinder volume states during attach\n    \n    This patch changes how Nova interacts with volumes at attach time.\n    Nova should rely upon Cinder's os-reserve to determine if the\n    state of the volume is in a good/valid state for attaching.\n    This fixes a race between when nova fetches the volume and calls\n    os-reserve.\n    \n    This refactors the volume_api.check_attach a bit and adds a new\n    check_availability_zone, which is still done on the Nova side.\n    When Cinder's os-reserve supports passing in the availability\n    zone, then this check can also be removed.\n    \n    This patch handles the volume attach API, which is not checked\n    again in the compute manager. Future patches will handle other\n    operations like boot from volume and swap volume.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1581230\n    \n    Change-Id: I5b069ba3480257c061541fc6c19e044c31417b5e\n",

As Cinder already performs the required checks as part\n    of the 'reserve_volume' (os-reserve) call it is unnecessary to check the\n    statemachine in Nova also and it can lead to race conditions.\n    \n    The missing 'reserve_volume' call is added to the BFV flow. In case of\n    build failure the volume will be locked in 'attaching' state until the\n    instance in ERROR state is cleaned up.\n    \n    We also check AZ for each volume attach operation which we haven't\n    done for unshelve. A release note is added to enable 'cross_az_attach'\n    in case the user does not care about AZ.\n    \n    The compute service version had to be bumped as the old computes still\n    perform 'check_attach', which will fail when the API reserves the\n    volume and the volume state moves to 'attaching'. If the computes\n    are not new enough the old check will be called as opposed to\n    'reserve_volume'.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1581230\n    Change-Id: I3a3caa4c566ecc132aa2699f8c7e5987bbcc863a\n",
