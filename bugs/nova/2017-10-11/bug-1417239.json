    "description": "People running Nova with cells are affected by this bug.\n\nThe bug can be reproduced by booting an instance from a volume with a block device mapping missing the device name. Although the instance boots fine, you won't be able to create an image from the instance.\n\nThis is because 2 block_device_mapping entries are created in the API cell:\n- one (created by the API cell) will have close to no information about the volume (device_name and volume_id are NULL)\n- the second one (bubbled up from the compute cell) will contain all the volume information\n\nThe first entry confuses Nova when creating an image since it won't be able to find the associated volume (NULL) in Cinder:\n\n  ERROR: Block Device Mapping is Invalid: failed to get volume XXX. (HTTP 400)\n\nThe fix is to not create the first block_device_mapping entry and let the compute cell sync it up to the API cell once created.",
