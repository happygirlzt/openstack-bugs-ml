Froloff <email address hidden>\nDate:   Tue Feb 17 16:16:42 2015 +0300\n\n    Wrap IPv6 address in square brackets for scp/rsync\n    \n    Address, contained in nova.netconf.my_ip config option, is passed to\n    scp/rsync when copying image during migration.  If this option contains\n    IPv6 address, scp/rsync fails.\n    \n    Wrapping IPv6 address in square brackets solves this problem.  Code was\n    adopted from swift project.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia5f28673e79158d948980f2b3ce496c6a56882af\n    Closes-Bug: #1422691\n",
