Since the migration is being tracked by the resource tracker on\n    the destination node, the source node has the instance in it's\n    tracked_instances.\n    \n    So in this case the PCI devices were only freed on the next periodic audit.\n    For PCI resources such as PCI passthrough, those are limited in number and\n    should be freed right away.\n    \n    This patch fixes drop_move_claim() to also free PCI devices when an instance\n    is in self.tracked_instances().\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Steven Webster <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: Ie3392f80dfd2650048519c571ffaa11c025ad048\n    Closes-Bug: #1641750\n",
