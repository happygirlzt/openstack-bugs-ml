Also the Python doc-strings are autodocumented from source and published to nova.openstack.org.\n\nediting to remove the Cloud Admin docs and move them to a new doc bug.",

Also any configuration you must do to get this feature working is required. Ideally the documents describe the feature much like the wiki page and give how-to information, reference information, and conceptual information for configuring your OpenStack cloud to use the new nova-volume driver. The relevant XML documents are:\nopenstack-manuals/doc/src/docbkx/openstack-compute-admin/computeconfigure.xml\nopenstack-manuals/doc/src/docbkx/openstack-compute-admin/computeadmin.xml",
