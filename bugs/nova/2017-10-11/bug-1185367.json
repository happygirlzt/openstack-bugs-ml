    "description": "Currently the compute API layer does not do any validation of the availability zone, so a request like:\n\nnova boot --availability_zone foobar\n\nwill be accepted, sent to the scheduler, and the instance will go to error.\n\nThere is already code in compute/api.py  which processes  the availability_zone  value\n\ndef _handle_availability_zone(availability_zone)\n...\n\n\nSo it seems like there should be some basic validation added to check that the zone exists and is available",

For example,\n\nnova boot --availability_zone foobar:host1\n\nThe VM will be created on compute host1 even though the foobar is not existing. So if we add the AZ check in api layer, it will break current design. So mark this bug to invalid.",
