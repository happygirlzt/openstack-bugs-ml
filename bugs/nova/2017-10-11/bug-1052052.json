    "description": "Current quota implementation relies on volume node to commit reservation, which would break when scheduling fails.   And there's no way a following 'delete' API can rollback that quota reservation.  Cinder doesn't do a minus reservation when deleting volume that failed to schedule neither.  Therefore, quota reservation is leaking when scheduling fails.\n\nTo reproduce this issue:\n\n1. stop and disable all volume nodes;\n2. create a volume A;\n3. delete volume A;\n4. check quotas table in DB.",
