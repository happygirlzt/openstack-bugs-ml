SCP command in blockdev.py https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/blockdev.py#L276 doesn't join the scp command on a space, which formats the scp command incorrectly. \n\n2.) networking isn't passed into _create_lpar_instance() and fails out since the network information is required. \n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/powervm/driver.py#L278\n\nI have a fix for this and can assign to myself.",

Also adds a parameter in driver.finish_migration to\n    _create_lpar_instance(), some refactoring that needed to be done in\n    order to launch the instance on the destination host. This patch fixes\n    Bug #1153599. This patch also address the tests cases for resize/migrate\n    functionality for PowerVM. Bug #1133058 is for tracking these test cases\n    \n    Change-Id: I86c1b697fe5c7d6e4a6c689f75fd5cf737cef5d4\n",
