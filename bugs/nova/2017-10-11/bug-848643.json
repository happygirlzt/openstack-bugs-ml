The error \"must be strings\" always raises when you use any euca-command except the ones which only generates output.\n\nA corresponding trace is here: http://paste.openstack.org/show/2426/\n\nVishy took a quick look and gave me the following:\n\nhttp://paste.openstack.org/show/2427/\n\nUsing this patch, the commands work again. I've used the rc for this.\n\nThanks, Vishy.",
