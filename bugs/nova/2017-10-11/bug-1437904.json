The file is inside the config\n         directory to be consistent with other projects.\n    \n    Some changes were made to the generate_sample.sh file in\n    order to give the base directories and target directories\n    to the generate_cinder_opts.py program.\n    \n    tox.ini was edited to remove the checkonly option because\n    all that needs to happen in check_uptodate.sh is a check to\n    ensure that the cinder.conf.sample is actually being\n    generated with no issues.\n    \n    All options were removed from the check_uptodate.sh\n    because they were unnecessary given the new, more simple\n    way of generating the cinder.conf.sample.\n    \n    setup.cfg was also edited in order to add information\n    oslo-config-generator needs to run.\n    \n    Co-Authored By: Jay Bryant <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored By: Jacob Gregor <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I643dbe5675ae9280e204f691781e617266f570d5\n    Closes-Bug: 1473768\n    Closes-Bug: 1437904\n    Closes-Bug: 1381563\n",
