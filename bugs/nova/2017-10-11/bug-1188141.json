Rescue mode should work if an instance is built from a snapshot and the snapshot is deleted, as long as the base image for that snapshot is still around.  Is that not working for some case?  Now if the base images get deleted that's different, and I'm not sure that adding os_type default images helps the situation since those could end up deleted as well.  Is there an example that helps illustrate the bug here?",
