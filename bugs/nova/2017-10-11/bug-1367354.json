            "content": "Here's the issue:  the fact that we currently use the StaticPool implementation with SQLite, which shares a single SQLite connection for all requests; any API method which makes use of multiple sessions at once (not a good idea, but this is prevalent throughout nova, neutron) will therefore share the same SQLite connection with multiple SQLAlchemy Connection wrappers that are not aware of the existing state.\n\nThe fix proposed at https://review.openstack.org/#/c/120148/ adds a marker into the .info dictionary to track this condition.\n\nUltimately we absolutely should not be creating ad-hoc sessions throughout nova, neutron, etc., this is an obvious performance and concurrency issue.   The StaticPool then is kind of a hack on top of a hack.",
