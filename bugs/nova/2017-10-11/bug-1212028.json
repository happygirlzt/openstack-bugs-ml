The only alternative is to expire reservations explicitly before every single QUOTAS.reserve()... which is not as performant.\n\nThis task doesn't necessarily belong in nova-scheduler.  It really could easily be moved to nova-conductor or nova-compute or something... but it needs to run somewhere!",
