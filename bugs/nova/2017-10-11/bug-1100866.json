    "description": "If an update for instance metadata is attempted during the boot process, before \"VM.get_by_name_label\" will return a vm_ref, then the metadata update will fail in the xenapi driver and the exception will pass up the stack and eventually revert the task state from \"spawning\" to None.  Then after the instance has finished booting and the _instance_update is attempted in _spawn() in compute/manager.py the expected task state is not found and the instance is put into ERROR status.\n\nOne possible solution would be to not allow metadata updates for spawning instances but since this is xenapi specific that may not be the correct approach.",
