In this case PCI devices that are not part of any migration are freed up and put back in the pool of available PCI devices.\n\nThe problem is that migration_get_in_progress_by_host_and_node only filters out migration in state ['confirmed', 'reverted', 'error'].  Migration is state 'failed' are reported as in progress.",
