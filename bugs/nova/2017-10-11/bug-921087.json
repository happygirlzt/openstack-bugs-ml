This filter is used for finding the\n    SR on which to install guest instances. The default value is the Local\n    Storage in default XenServer/XCP installations, and it is what was hard-coded\n    so far.\n    \n    To select an SR with a different matching criteria, this flag can be set\n    to 'other-config:my_favorite_sr=true'. On the other hand, to fall back on\n    the Default SR, as displayed by XenCenter and as returned by\n    xenapi.pool.get_default_SR, this flag can be set to to 'default-sr:true'.\n    \n    This changeset also makes a small code simplification along the way.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia5ee438389c59a5ef0b858e8548643d57ef16c77\n",
