With the current code, more than 128 flavor extra spec items can be created.\nEither of the two should be done:\n\n1. Enforce the metadata limit (use _check_metadata_properties_quota() just as used in instance metadata) , Or,\n2. If this limit should not be enforced, then the exception handling code should be removed.",
