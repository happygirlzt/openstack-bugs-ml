This causes problems when called by\n    _rollback_live_migration.\n    \n    This fix is more for future consistency, as this was affecting the\n    _ComputeV4Proxy class, which is present in stable/kilo but\n    no longer exists.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iacadd5f015888c4181b8a332625ec746f991e239\n    Closes-Bug: #1538619\n",
