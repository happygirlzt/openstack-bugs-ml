My undestanding is that the VM should never start if there was any failure during disk creation process. Unfortunatelly in my case VM was created and started, but the disk size did not match parameters requested in flavor.\n\nAdditionally same requests works on other nodes, so it was not the problem with mount command ( I believe it might have been hardware issue, but I'm not sure about it  ).\n",
