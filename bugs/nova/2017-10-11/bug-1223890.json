This\n    patch fixes that issue.\n    \n    Also adds the 'lun' type to the list of supported device_types since it\n    is supported by libvirt but was missed in the previous refactoring.\n    \n    Tests are added to prevent future regressions.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1223890\n    \n    Change-Id: Iee160afcc23f762a752df1ca20372944d5100291\n",
