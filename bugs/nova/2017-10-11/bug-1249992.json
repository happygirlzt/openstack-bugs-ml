This causes\n    problem with instance task state - it is stuck in MIGRATION state.\n    \n    Because compareCPU method is part of live migration pre-checks,\n    this patch changes exception that is reraised in libvirt driver\n    from libvirt.libvirtError to exception.MigrationPreCheckError.\n    \n    This change also adds unit tests for compareCPU method.\n    \n    Change-Id: If7b614c643b172a6b05a30075769b851343984d4\n    Closes-Bug: #1249992\n    Co-Authored-By: Pawel Koniszewski <email address hidden>\n",
