    "description": "Due to the periodic task \"_check_instance_build_time,\" a VM is set from BUILD to ERROR because the related VM creation is delayed, for example, due to a temporary network partition. That VM can, however, transit from ERROR to ACTIVE, once the temporary partition is resolved and the VM creation completes. \n\nWe found such an ERROR to ACTIVE transition problematic, in particular because it can happen without inputs/actions from an external user. The rationale is that, when a user tries to create a VM but finds that it is marked in an error state, the user will probably retry the VM creation. The above automatic state transition may thus give the user more VMs than he intends to create.",
