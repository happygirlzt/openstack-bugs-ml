This meant\n    test_uri_length_limit's test queries to http://localhost:$port/ would\n    hit the wrong localhost when $HTTP_PROXY was another host - resulting in a\n    meaningless test scenario and apparent failures with HTTP status codes\n    other than the expected REQUEST_URI_TOO_LARGE (414).\n    \n    This change forces requests to go direct for those test queries.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1329614\n    Change-Id: Ida3424ca9a750bd2d3f2e81dc7dfacc2a334adf1\n",
