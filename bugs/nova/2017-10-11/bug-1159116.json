Given that testr doesn't spit data base the same order as nose, if we want colorizer support, we really need to handle the data as testr native.\n\nAll told, this feature should probably not even exist in nova, and instead be something that's contributed back to testr directly, so it's available to all users.",

When I switched the base\n    test result class to testtools I lost the methods that were\n    printing out the errors at the end.
