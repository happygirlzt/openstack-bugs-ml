The old random selection could cause\n    immediate retrying of the same host that failed.\n    \n    This also adds logging of the host:port that failed and fixes a bug in\n    the retry test, which didn't actually successfully test retrying.\n    \n    Tests for new code added.\n    \n    Change-Id: I400616081e1e547b9ca2e0be622889d3a399a5bf\n",
