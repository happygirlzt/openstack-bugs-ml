Upload the AMI/AKI/ARI images attached to this bug into Glance and tie them together (if how to do this is not common knowledge, I can follow-on with exact steps)\n2.  Boot an instance against the image.  It has been altered so that it will crash on startup, believing there is filesystem corruption\n\nExpected Behaviour:\n\nA \"Press enter for maintenance (or type Control-D to continue):\" prompt on the interactive console (Spice/VNC/etc.)\n\nActual Behaviour:\n\nThe aforementioned prompt appears in the libvirt console.log, and the instance is effectively bricked.",
