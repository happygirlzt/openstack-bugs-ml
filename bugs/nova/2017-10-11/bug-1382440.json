If the storage has many targets,\n    connecting to all these volumes will also result in many unnecessary\n    connections.\n    \n    There are two types of iSCSI multipath devices.  One which shares\n    the same iqn between multiple portals, and the other which use\n    different iqns on different portals. connect_volume() needs to\n    identify the type by checking iscsiadm the output if the iqn is\n    used by multiple portals.\n    \n    This patch changes the behavior of attaching volume:\n    \n       1. Identify the type by checking the iscsiadm output.\n       2. Connect to the correct targets by connect_to_iscsi_portal().\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1382440\n    \n    Change-Id: I488ad0c09bf26a609e27d67b9ef60b65bb45e0ad\n",
