This is something provided in the AWS and would be a useful addition to Openstack.\nIn AWS on a machine with multiple NICs, the information can be exposed via the meta-store.  This is useful, as it enables machines to automatically configured there network interfaces on bootup. i.e. a script running from rc.local can query the metastore, and create a interface file for each additional NIC.  The information provided also includes cidr-blocks and mac addresses which has been useful when setting up asymmetric routing on some VMs.\n\nThe alternative approach we have used up until now, is to have user-data passed to the VM, providing this information, but it means user-data must be created for each VM.\n\n\n\ncurl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/\n02:2c:cd:4b:ed:0b/\n02:86:e3:35:08:c1/\n02:d9:66:42:27:b2/\n02:db:ad:a7:0a:e5/\n\nThis returns the mac address for each interface.

I'm going to move it to \"Opinion / Wishlist\", which is an easily-obtainable queue of older requests that have come on. \n\nIn case you want to work on that, consider writing a blueprints [1] and spec [2]. I'll recommend to read [3] if not yet done. The effort to implement the requested feature is then driven only by the blueprint (and spec).\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/nova-specs\n[3] https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints",
