We should switch to using assertRaisesRegex\n    instead. This commit eliminates these warnings from the log and the hacking\n    rule N344 ensures that folks don't end up adding fresh code down the line\n    with the outdated assertRaisesRegexp as well\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1407736\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifba672f7568d5159c63bf88c534812e4e3a26d5a\n",
