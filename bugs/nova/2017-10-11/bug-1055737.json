(We have old non-nova\n    code that does that on xenserver, and that method is known to work).\n    \n    This should also make it much easier for other hypervisors other than\n    xenserver to implement bandwidth polling, as polling the counters is a rather\n    more universal method.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1055737\n    \n    Change-Id: I6a280d8bbfcc74914f888b11bc09349a270a5f58\n",
