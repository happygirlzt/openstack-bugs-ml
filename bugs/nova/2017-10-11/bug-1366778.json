I've updated my patch accordingly, and will have a\nTempest patch shortly that fixes the test that's failing there, too.\n\nThis is actually a forward-port of an internal patch we had against\nGrizzly, where the name restrictions weren't consistent, which is why the\nbug is phrased as it is. I don't see a particular downside to loosening the\nrestrictions on resource names as long as it happens across the board.\n\n\nOn Wed, Sep 10, 2014 at 11:07 AM, Sean Dague <email address hidden> wrote:\n\n> This seems like something which should come out to the mailing list.\n> This restriction was added to create more consistency throughout\n> OpenStack, and reversing it is something I'm quite concerned about.\n>\n> ** Changed in: nova\n>    Importance: Undecided => Wishlist\n>\n> --\n> You received this bug notification because you are subscribed to the bug\n> report.\n> https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1366778\n>\n> Title:\n>   Flavor names unnecessarily restrictive\n>\n> Status in OpenStack Compute (Nova):\n>   In Progress\n>\n> Bug description:\n>   Flavor names are restricted to \"word\" characters, period, dash, and\n>   space, for no apparent reason.
