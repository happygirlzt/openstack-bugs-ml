This also introduces the minimum libvirt version needed\n    for PowerPC to support NUMA from Nova.\n    \n    Also note, that in order to retain the unit test that excluded\n    PPC from the NUMA supported architectures, an arbitrary choice\n    of architecture is made (S390) - that is not a part of the list\n    that supports NUMA.\n    \n    Change-Id: I51dd3e160153b40072a04095e9bf3f15abd74252\n    Closes-Bug: #1516578\n",
