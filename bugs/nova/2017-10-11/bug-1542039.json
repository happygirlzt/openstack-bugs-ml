    "description": "I'm investigating an issue where an instance with a large disk and an attached cinder volume was booted in a stable/kilo OpenStack setup with the diskFilter disabled.\n\nThe timeline looks like this:\nscheduler picks initial compute node\nnova attempts to boot it up on one compute node, it runs out of disk space and gets rescheduled\n scheduler picks another compute node\nuser requests instance deletion\nuser requests cinder volume deletion\nnova attempts to boot it up on second compute node, it runs out of disk space and gets rescheduled\nscheduler picks a third compute node\nnova  attempts to boot it up on third compute node, runs into problems due to missing cinder volume\n\n\nThe issue I want to address in this bug is whether it makes sense to reschedule the instance when the instance has already been deleted.\n\nAlso, instance deletion sets the task_state to 'deleting' early on.  In compute.manager.ComputeManager._do_build_and_run_instance(), if we decide to reschedule then nova-compute will set the task_state to 'scheduling' and then save the instance, which I think could overwrite the 'deleting' state in the DB.\n\nSo...would it make sense to have nova-compute put an \"expected_task_state\" on the instance.save() call that sets the 'scheduling' task_state?",
