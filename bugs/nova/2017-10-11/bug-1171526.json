So as an admin,  he don't know what happened for the 'MIGRATING' instance, only if he checks the log file. At this time, the instance run happily on source host with status 'MIGRATING'\n\nI think for for above case should with following behavior: \n\n1. The instance should keep 'Active' status\n2.

Issue a live migration that assumes shared storage, e.g., \"nova live-migration ed7c55b8-897d-4cc2-b406-2667f4377af0\"\n\nThe live migration will fail, and the instance will remain permanently stuck in a \"Migrating\" state, and needs to be terminated.\n\nThe same holds true for the converse, i.e., assume block migrations on compute nodes with shared storage.",
