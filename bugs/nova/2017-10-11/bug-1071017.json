That information is\n    now passed in from the API layer over RPC.\n    \n    In the offending changeset (), the network_info was getting coerced\n    to a list and thus calls to NetworkInfo.legacy() were failing in the\n    manager's _legacy_nw_info() method. This patch rehydrates the\n    NetworkInfo using the existing method for doing so, which fixes\n    bug 1071017. A test is also added to prevent future regressions.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8fd1c2dde573bb7da3bfe1ee3193f9ba1167aaa7\n",
