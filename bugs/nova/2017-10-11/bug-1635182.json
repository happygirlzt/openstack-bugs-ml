This is easy to forget.\n    \n    This change adds wrapper for webob.dec.wsgify which will set default custom\n    json error formatter. Resource based actions from placement need to use this\n    wrapper as decorater instead of webob.dec.wsgify.\n    \n    In this change, decorator updated for allocations related actions.\n    Change in other resource handlers can be addressed in subsequent patches.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3b81c5bd00a013f1659b9e6e80c71b373d965862\n    Partial-Bug: #1635182\n",
