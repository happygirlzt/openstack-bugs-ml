    "description": "Hello!\n\nI'm trying to implement OpenStack solution in my environment ( bunch of Mac Minis) with one NIC card limitation. So far, I was able to setup a Controller and two Compute Nodes and created several VMs in compute nodes.\n\nMy host (Controller/Compute) are in 10.x.x.x series and I've setup the br100 private network for VMs in 192.168.100.x series per document. So, both Host and VMs have different gateway.\n\nProblem : My Hosts (Controller/Compute) can communicate (ping/SSH) to their VMs but other server from same network (10.x.x.x) are unable to communicate to VMs. Vice versa, VMs are unable to communicate to other Hosts of the 10.x.x.x network except controller & compute nodes and also to the outer world.\n\nWhat could be possible solution for this? Any help would be really appreciated. Please let me know, what information/files should I provide to diagnose it further. Can we do any kind of NATing or iptables rules in OpenStack like VMWare provides? By the way, I'm using FlatDHCPManager mode.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nnova-manage version - 2013.1.1",
