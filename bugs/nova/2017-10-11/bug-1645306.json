This\n    worked because the config loaded by the project name is the same\n    as the config loaded otherwise.\n    \n    There's no test coverage of this in unit and functional tests\n    because the NoAuthMiddleware is always used based on overridden\n    configuration. The gate tests that turn on placement will exercise\n    this code.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9f1b8905fd9d5aadac61718e24c76b1b2f80410d\n    Closes-Bug: #1645306\n",
