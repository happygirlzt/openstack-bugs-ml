Previously, only calls to\n       nova.api.ec2.cloud.CloudController.describe_images would\n       add new mappings, but now any attempt to convert a glance id\n       to an internal id will succeed, resolving bug 948286.\n    \n     * Adds 2 convenience methods to ec2utils, as per bcwaldon:\n    \n           ec2_id_to_glance_id\n           glance_id_to_ec2_id\n    \n     * Since this is a strict refactor and only streamlines existing\n       well-tested functionality, this change includes no new tests.\n    \n    Change-Id: I810afe05223228df1bcc20a0ac688d8c62c472b4\n",
