            "content": "Shipping init/upstart scripts with the software is generally pretty useless and misleading. Each distro has its own set of rules as to which init system to use, we can't write a script that would be acceptable to all (or to more than one). Furthermore, distros ship with the ideal init script for them, maintaining your own in parallel of that would be misleading (ours would be not as good or as current, but people could think they should use that instead of the one provided by the distro).\r\n\r\nBasically, init scripts are a part of the packaging, not a part of the source. If you're working on your own packaging and need examples, they can be found in open source distro packages... Shipping our own outdated examples doesn't help.",
