User1 of Tenant1 creates an image for his tenant.\n2. User 2 of Tenant2 tries to create a server and passes the image ID from Step1.\n\nExpected Response error code:\n404 NotFound\n\nActual Response error code:\n400 Bad Request\n\"badRequest\": {\n\"message\": \"Can not find requested image\",\n\"code\": 400\n}\n}\n\nIt seems this was fixed earlier, and Nova did return 404 NotFound. However on the recent master,\nit returns 400 Bad Request.\n\nRefer https://bugs.launchpad.net/tempest/+bug/1039608",
