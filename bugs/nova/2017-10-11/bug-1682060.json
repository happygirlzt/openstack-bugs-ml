It works a bit easier for upgrades from non-cells to cells but for a fresh install I wouldn't use it. I'd change tooling for a fresh install to follow the steps in this document:\n\nhttps://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/cells.html#fresh-install",

So we have a bit of a catch-22 here. I'm going to re-open this bug for nova simply because we have a documentation issue that needs to be fixed.\n\nWe might also need to raise that as a DocImpact bug for the install guide in openstack-manuals.",

The hypervisor list command will not work before the\n    hosts are discovered, and with the steps as they are now in the\n    guide, you wait to discover the hosts until the hypervisors\n    show up, which is a chicken-and-egg problem.\n    \n    The solution proposed is to use the openstack compute service\n    list command instead, which does not have the same host\n    discovery pre-requisite limitation. The nova cells install guide\n    docs are also being updated in the nova tree for the same issue.\n    \n    Kolla is also making a similar change for their Pike deployment\n    scripts:\n    \n    Id061e8039e72de77a04c51657705457193da2d0f\n    \n    Change-Id: If2baab40c2e2a3de20e561bba50688d615b002ef\n    Closes-Bug: #1682060\n",
