The unittest which tests that an integer\n    passed as the name fails, but this is due to the policies parameter\n    missing from the test data, not because the name is invalid.\n    \n    The internal nova code silently converts floats, integers, etc to strings\n    and so also does not pick up the validation issue.\n    \n    The patch adds extra input validation to the API layer to pick up this issue\n    and also tightens the acceptable values of the string to reject trailing\n    or leading whitespace which if used can cause confusion for users. It uses\n    the regexp that the other parts of the API are converging towards to use\n    as a common acceptable name across the API rather than having different\n    criteria for names for different extensions.\n    \n    Also ensures input validation is always properly applied to the policies\n    parameter and adds test cases. This part is backported from this\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/79312/5 patch.\n    \n    The patch also fixes the broken unittests and adds new ones to test the\n    tightened criteria for the name parameter.\n    \n    +DocImpact\n    Co-authored-by: Gary Kotton <email address hidden>\n    Closes-Bug: 1290326\n    \n    Change-Id: I9ddaef8a128ac6a1a448e47d6b3c9abcf719eb76\n",
