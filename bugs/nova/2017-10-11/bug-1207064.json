    "description": "Comment from @dims on code review - https://review.openstack.org/#/c/37819/\n\n\"Shawn, i was going through the code again for this change and realized that when *not* using linked clone we don't the vmware_base dir at all which means we do a fresh transfer of image from glance to hyper every time. Would it be better to still have the vmdk in vmware_base and do a CopyDatastoreFile_Task or CopyVirtualDisk_Task to copy it over into the new directory from vmware_base for each new guest? In other words, we always cache vmdk(s) in vmware_base to skip the network transfer (and hence take the network transfer hit just one for the first time an image is needed in a hyper)\"\n\nResponse from Shawn:\nI was dealing with a test related issue. That I finally resolved by re-introducing some \"bad\" code, comments are in line with the code. Can you see clear to view that change as out of scope of this patch? That feels like a separate issue from introducing new controls. I would prefer to open a separate bug for this since the feature to turn *off* linked-clone strategy was already present (as a global setting).",
