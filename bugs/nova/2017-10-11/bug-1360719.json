But\n    test_killed_worker_recover doesn't try to kill the children, unlike other\n    tests in test_multiprocess_api. This didn't cause the unit test to fail\n    because tearDown catches the unit test timeout, fixtures.TimeoutException,\n    which triggers after 160 seconds.\n    \n    Now instead of taking 160 seconds test_killed_worker_recover, which is\n    run twice, takes under 3 seconds.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8cbd08cb873cd81a65005764759ac9ca23fa6430\n    Closes-Bug: #1360719\n",
