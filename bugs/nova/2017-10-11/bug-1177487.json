    "description": "The scheduler lookups compute node information in the DB at the beginning every request.  These DB lookups can be slow due to a missing index on compute_node_stats.  The impact is that under heavy load, the scheduler can fall behind and mark services as down when the ComputeFilter runs, which will fail a request.",
