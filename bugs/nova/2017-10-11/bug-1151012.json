A common Linux configuration returns the FQDN, while a\n    Windows one returns only the host name.\n    \n    To resolve inconsistent node naming in deployments that mix windows and\n    Linux, it is proposed to use 'getfqdn' as default function instead of\n    'gethostname'. This is function is more predictable in all cases.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3164d9a36df2b8484bbf9a57879c31fa0e342503\n",
