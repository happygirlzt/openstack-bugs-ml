As every time a scheduler is added it will do a fanout to all of them.\n\nThis bug is speculative.  The issue is all the compute-nodes would blast RPC responses back at the same time potentially causing issues with RPC.  furthermore if there a a large number of compute-nodes handling that many RPC request at the same time may bog down the scheduler.\n\n\nRelated to https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1071254",

            "content": "I can see that being a problem.  The history behind the broadcasting of capabilities goes way back... and most of the reasons for it no longer exist.  The 2 big ones were:\n\n* Computes broadcasting info about their local .conf that the scheduler could not get from the DB.  This included 'capabilities', which have been completely replaced by host aggrs (i believe)\n* Computes broadcasting their capacity info.  The scheduler used to base decisions off of these broadcasts before it was switched to use capacity info from the DB\n\nWe don't have a need for them if everything can be found in the DB.  That should be true for the above.  But there may be 1 thing left that we use the broadcasts for:\n\n* Certain hypervisor info returned from get_host_stats() virt driver call...  I believe there's info here that we do not store in the DB ATM.  And I think we turn some of this info into capabilities that we send across.\n\nI think we can stuff the remaining info into the DB and nuke these broadcast messages completely.",
