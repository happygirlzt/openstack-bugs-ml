Does this mean resize would require use of the zones scheduler?\n\nI'd like to see us go with a model where we provide scheduler hints so it can make a more intelligent decision. If a scheduler is dumb, \"random\", or whatever... a resize could still be supported (although I agree much less likely to succeed).\n\nDan",

I proposed putting it in POST /zone/boot since that's the ugly cousin of POST /servers.\n\nFor this, however, we could probably already use CostScheduler with some minor tweaks. ",
