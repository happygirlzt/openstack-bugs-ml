    "description": "If booting from a volume, the virt driver does the setup of the volume with cinder before starting the instance. This differs from the attach volume case, which is managed by nova itself. Since the connect operation could yield new details in the connection_info structure that need to be persisted until teardown time, it is important that the connection_info be written back after connect completes. Nova's attach_volume() does this, but libvirt does not. Specifically in the case of the fibre channel code, this means we don't persist information about multipath devices which means we don't fully tear down everything at disconnect time.\n\nThis is present in at least Havana, and I expect it is present in Icehosue and master as well.",
