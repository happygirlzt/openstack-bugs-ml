Many APIs don't work correctly in cells v1 because the parent databases isn't synced with cell databases, except for the instances table. So keypairs are only in the parent database and can't be queried from cells. Here is a related bug for flavors [1].\r\n\r\nTo work around, you would have to manually sync keypairs to your cell databases.\r\n\r\nThis problem won't be addressed in Cells v1 and will be handled correctly in Cells v2.\r\n\r\n[1] https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1211011",
