    "description": "When using Nova vmware driver to attach a raw iscsi volume (using 'RDMp' style) to a VM, found the iscsi volume is attached to the VM's VirtualIDEController. It's expected to attached to a scsi controller, such as VirtualLsiLogicSASController.  \n\nIn nova.virt.vmwareapi.volumeops.py, the method of ' _attach_volume_iscsi' gets the adapter type:\n\n(vmdk_file_path, adapter_type, disk_type) = vm_util.get_vmdk_path_and_adapter_type(hardware_devices)\n\nThe method get_vmdk_path_and_adapter_type will iterate all the hardware devices, and return the adapter type of the first Virtual Disk it reads. If the first virtual disk is not an iscsi disk, e.g., an IDE disk, then VirtualIDEController will be returned as the adapter type, and the iscsi volume will be attached to that incorrect controller.\n\nTo fix this issue, we perhaps need a new method to find a suitable existing scsi controller for the volume, or to create a new controller if there's no scsi controller right now.",

Current logic is to get an existing disk and use its\n    adapter type to create and attach iSCSI disk. So an SCSI disk\n    would be created under an IDE controller if the existing\n    disk is an IDE disk. This fix will find out a SCSI controller from\n    the vm and return its corresponding adapter type.\n    \n    Change-Id: I33b6f3a88a5253755971622b4f05a30f48003331\n    Closes-bug: #1386511\n",
