Remove compression flag from rsync command in nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py:copy_image function.\n2. Do not change nova's code at all but configure rsync using rsyncd.conf file. We can specify parameter \"dont compress\" with suffix \"_rbase\". Before executing rsync command image is renamed with adding \"_rbase\" suffix. With such global configuration we can avoid compressing image even with --compress option in rsync command.",

            "content": "Efficiency of rsync with compression depends on many variables: content type, processor speed on both sides, network speed, etc.\nSo I made an investigation for comparison rsync with and without compression.\nIn this test I used two qcow images with the same size 10Gb: \n1. image data consists of text files(copies of nova sources). This image could be compressed very well.\n2. image contains copies of ubuntu server iso image. This image couldn't be compressed well.\nIn test I used processors are Intel i5 2.5Ghz, network speed 1000 Mbps.\nIn my test I copied each of images with and without rsync compression.\nFor tests rsync  version 3.1.0  protocol version 31 was used.\nResults:\n1. rsync image with text data without compression:\nreal\t3m37.876s\nuser\t1m6.936s\nsys\t0m19.919s\nuser + sys = 87s\n\n2. rsync image with text data with compression:\nreal\t8m16.501s\nuser\t6m55.878s\nsys\t0m19.695s\nuser + sys = 436s\n\n3. rsync image with binary data without compression:\nreal\t3m37.846s\nuser\t1m6.098s\nsys\t0m20.485s\nuser + sys = 87s\n\n4. rsync image with binary data with compression:\nreal\t8m20.839s\nuser\t6m34.998s\nsys\t0m20.554s\nuser + sys = 416s\n\nAnalizing results:\n- I was wondering that rsync with compression faster for binary data than text data.\n- With described environment I obtained huge advantage of compression-free rsync for both images.\nSince rsync uses only one processor's core we can't not expect big improvement of compression speed soon.\nMy conclusion is that compression could be usefull for networks with speed less that 10Mb.\nSince network with such a slow performance are obsolete  rsync compression must be removed from code. Also this fix will allow us to decrease CPU consumption.",
