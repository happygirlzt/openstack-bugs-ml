Manual testing shows\n    that updated_at is generally different because there's something\n    else that is also leading to a compute_node.save() approximately\n    every sixty seconds. So while this fix removes one redundant\n    save, it doesn't get all of them, thus the \"partial\" below.\n    \n    A unit test is added to exercise different updated_at values.\n    \n    Change-Id: If688ae4d92ecdea83479f37de8856b668b8bc7a6\n    Partial-Bug: #1658629\n",
