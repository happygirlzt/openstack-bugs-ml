This would atleast give\n    an idea to the operator on the maximum supported version on the\n    controller/conductor APIs.\n    \n    This patch will print the maximum supported version information\n    in the exception log.\n    \n    Change-Id: I5004a4173df5f556633d3547b504bda467e4426d\n    Closes-Bug: #1443868\n",
