(Tested on Essex<2012.1~e4> on Ubuntu 11.10)\n\nI did following changes in nova/compute/api.py:\n  interchanged the vm_states.ACTIVE to vm_states.SUSPENDED in the below line\n  \n         @check_instance_state(vm_state=[vm_states.SUSPENDED, vm_states.SHUTOFF], task_state=[None])\n    def resize(self, context, instance, flavor_id=None, **kwargs):\n\t\nNow, the resize works well in SUSPENDED state.\nIf user tries to resize the instance in the ACTIVE state then it throws an exception.\n\nERROR: Cannot 'resize' while instance is in vm_state active (HTTP 409)\n\nIf the change is ok, I will go ahead and commit in git.",
