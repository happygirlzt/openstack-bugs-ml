            "content": "Sure Chuck, a practical example would be to create a qcow2 image with a boot partition and a '/' partition. Turn any of the file injection options on, like maybe use flat_injected=true. Make sure you have a vg created and that it's in your nova.conf. Also make sure you have libvirt_images_type=lvm.  Also make sure that libvirt_inject_partition is set to 2 for this example.\n\nTry spawning an instance and watch the compute log, you will see that injecting the network template fails. Now try an instance that is unpartitioned, set your libvirt_inject_partition to 0 and it should work.\n\nI have not tested this on master, just on stable/folsom. I have a patch for folsom, but it looks like the current master is significantly different so I am working up a patch for that.",
