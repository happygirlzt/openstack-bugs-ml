This is consistent with the ec2 api specification, which says this field should be:\n\n\"ownerId The ID of the AWS account that owns the reservation.\"\n\nThey examples have large numbers as values, so this isn't meant to be a human readable value. That's unfortunate, given euca2ools doesn't try to do the lookup to turn this into one.\n\nI'm going to close this bug as invalid though, as it is what the spec intends for this call.",
