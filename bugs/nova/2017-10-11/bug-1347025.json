This used to basically default to CONF.my_ip. This patch\n    allows the host to have a separate config option in the case the block\n    traffic is on a separate network.\n    \n    DocImpact: Adds my_block_storage_ip config option for block traffic going\n    over a separate network.\n    Closes-Bug: #1347025\n    \n    Change-Id: I2bab7226376acd7da78e038a230bf65613547ba6\n",
