That's OK.\n\nBut if you operate these commands under psql, you'll find the result will always be the old deleted one.\n\nThat means, the flavorid will always be occupied by the first record who use this flavorid under psql,\neven if this flavor has already been deleted. \n\nMore info can be found at here: http://paste.openstack.org/show/72752/",
