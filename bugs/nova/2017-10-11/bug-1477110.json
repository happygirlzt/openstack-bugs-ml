Also add libgfapi tag to this bug and mention it in the bug title, so its clear to others.\n\n3) Also as Markus said, need c-vol logs and n-cpu logs. In the code i do see that _get_snap_dev is using backing_store only if its not None, but i presume, the my_snap_dev will be formed incorrectly. Attaching the logs will helps us understand better\n\n4) FWIW, pls check patch @ https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202442/7 that fixes a similar issue, but for the non-libgfapi (fuse mount) case. I recommend if you can pair up with that patch's author and collaborate on the same patch, that ways 1 patch fixes the issue for both fuse and libgfapi based disks.",

Either you are using a older version of libvirt that doesn't support backing_store or you\nare NOT using libgfapi, in which case the patch fix doesn't seem right.
