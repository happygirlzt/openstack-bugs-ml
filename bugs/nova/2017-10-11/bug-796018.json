    "description": "Provider firewall rules are currently implemented as a in instance chains (eg. nova-compute-instance-2).  This currently only matches incoming traffic due to the jump to the instance chain being matched using the destination ip of the instance (eg. nova-compute-local -d 10.0.0.3 -j nova-compute-inst-2).  This works fine for filtering incoming, unsolicited traffic.\n\nIt would also be nice to block new connections to the hosts that are blacklisted via provider rules.  The best way to do this might be to add rules in nova-compute-OUTPUT during calls to refresh_provider_fw_rules in the firewall driver.",
