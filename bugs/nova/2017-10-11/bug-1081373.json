There's no reason to ever use the the XML files stored in the instances directory; it is there for operational purposes only.  Unless we absolutely need the running XML, we should use to_xml to generate the configuration based on what Nova absolutely knows about the instance.  Also, we should make sure that if we're keeping an XML file around in the instances directory for operations, that it's always kept up to date.\n\nThis will undo any one-off/by-hand changes in favor of absolute consistency with the database, which is preferred.

First, the on-disk XML file in the instances\n    directory is never to be used by the libvirt driver. It will be\n    generated via to_xml(). Second, anytime it is safe to re-define the\n    XML using the version we programatically generate, we do so.\n    \n    Extended to_xml() to support a new write_to_disk argument. When true,\n    this the resulting XML will be written to the instances directory.\n    Renamed _get_domain_xml to _get_existing_domain_xml, as it should only\n    be used when we need the XML for a defined domain. It will continue to\n    fall back to using to_xml() if the defined version is not available.\n    \n    Hard reboots will now assume nothing about the defined state within\n    libvirt. Rather, we generate and define the domain every time. This\n    eliminates the possibility of the hypervisor and Nova database going\n    out of sync (i.e. volume attached in defined XML with Nova having no\n    knowledge). We no longer need to pass an xml argument into\n    _hard_reboot() since it is always generated.\n    \n    Resume state on boot has been updated with logic similar to that of\n    _hard_reboot. Again, after a hypervisor reboot (or detection of downed\n    VMs on compute start), we should not assume the defined XML is valid.\n    The state or configuration of the VM, from Nova's perspective, may\n    have been changed while the system was down.\n    \n    The post_live_migration_on_destination() method used to call to_xml()\n    without block_device_info. This would result in an on-disk XML without\n    any volume mappings. The compute manager has been updated to pass bdi\n    so that this XML can be generated and written correctly. The Mox stub\n    for this function has been replaced by a stub in the fake virt driver.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4aa1068fa3aa54fdb7e690d46b6cf2e41bb20bc9\n",
