    "description": "When retreiving the console output through the os-console-output API in ^M characters appear in the output. Sometimes ^M characters appear without a corresponding linefeed character.  As a side-effect this causes  the tempest test test_get_console_output to sometimes fail. This occurs when the tests run slowly compared to a booting instance and the console output looks like this (the tempest test has requested 10 lines of console output):\n\n================START====================\n WARN: /etc/rc3.d/S99-cloud-userdata failed^M\n  ____               ____  ____^M\n / __/ __ ____ ____ / __ \\/ __/^M\n/ /__ / // __// __// /_/ /\\ \\ ^M\n\\___//_//_/  /_/   \\____/___/ ^M\n http://launchpad.net/cirros^M\n^M\n^M^M\nlogin as 'cirros' user. default password: 'cubswin:)'. use 'sudo' for root.^M\ncirros login: \n==================END================\n\nDuring conversion from XML the lxml/etree module ends up coverting ^M/LF characters to LF but also ^M characters by themselves are also converted to LF. This ends up with effectively 12 lines of output and so the test fails as it is only expecting 10 lines. The test passes if the instance is slow to boot as the excerpts from earlier in the boot process do not contain consecutive ^M characters.\n\nWhilst this is fixable on the tempest side test I'm wondering if this is the behaviour that we expect from Nova. Firstly it is a a bit of a surprise that we are generating ^M characters on linux booting a linux instance. Does anyone know where these are coming?\n\nThe console-output extension currently filters out a few characters before passing back the console output:\n\n        # XML output is not correctly escaped, so remove invalid characters\n        remove_re = re.compile('[\\x00-\\x08\\x0B-\\x0C\\x0E-\\x1F]')\n\nShould ^M characters be added to this list - will this adversely affect anyone?",
