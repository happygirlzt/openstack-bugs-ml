    "description": "powervm_img_local_path and powervm_img_remote_path are required by the powervm driver for very much every supported operation. However, driver loads without issues and user discovers the config options where not set when they get strange \"no such file or directory erros\" to simplify debugging and as an early detection, I recommend raising a well defined exception that will let user know they need to set these variables ad driver load time. That is driver will fail to load if this vars are not set to valid Unix paths.",
