    "description": "The libvirt driver currently does not set the machine type for a KVM guest by default.  When not specified, libvirt will use the newest one it knows about.  Unfortunately, that can result in live migrations failing if your environment is using different versions of the host OS on compute noes as the destination node may not be able to support the machine type used when the VM was originally started.\n\nA simple solution to this is to provide a new option which allows you to specify the default machine type on a per compute node basis (nova.conf option).  By using this option, you can ensure that VMs are started with a machine type that will allow it to be live migrated to other nodes in the deployment.",

When not specified, libvirt will use the newest one\n    it knows about. Unfortunately, that can result in live migrations\n    failing if your environment is using different versions of the host OS\n    on compute nodes as the destination node may not be able to support the\n    machine type used when the VM was originally started.\n    \n    A simple solution to this is to provide a new option which allows you\n    to specify the default machine type on a per compute node basis\n    (nova.conf option). By using this option, you can ensure that VMs are\n    started with a machine type that will allow it to be live migrated to\n    other nodes in the deployment.\n    \n    This patch implements that solution by adding the hw_machine_type\n    option to the [libvirt] group of nova.conf.\n    \n    DocImpact\n    Closes-bug: #1331170\n    \n    Change-Id: I223c70c729315b6ffc01eb293fe70553ef827162\n",
