    "description": "Currently when detaching a volume we do:\n\n1. driver.detach() -> detaches the volume in the hypervisor\n2. cinder.detach() -> marks the volume detached in cinder\n3. bdm.delete() -> stops the nova side from reporting an attached volume.\n\nThis leads to bad UX for two reasons:\n\na. If the cinder detach fails, the bdm still exists so nova reports a volume attached even when the hypervisor\n    has detached it.\nb. There is a window where cinder reports the volume available but nova still thinks the attachment exists\n\nI propose we reverse the order of 2. and 3.\n\nThis reverses a. so that a detach fail will show the volume as attached in cinder but nova will not show it. The nova side more accurately reflects what nova knows about.\nThis reverses b. so that there is a window where nova has removed the attachment but cinder still reports it in use. This is a fairly minor difference, but leads to a nicer experience when you are detaching and re-attaching the same volume because it can be reattached once it becomes available.\n\nThis also may help with https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1172695",
