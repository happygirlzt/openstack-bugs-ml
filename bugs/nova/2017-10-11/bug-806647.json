My situation:\r\n\r\n- I'm not using NBD anymore, so this is for normal LXC mounted chroots\r\n- I'm using Nova Cactus\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this bug:\r\n\r\n- Run an instance with Nova (with LXC / Libvirt hypervisor)\r\n- Reboot the system while having a running instance \r\n- When the system is rebooted, the instances are not mounted anymore, so when I try to terminate the instance it complains that it cannot unmount the LXC chroot, and therefore cannot terminate the instance\r\n\r\nI created a small two line patch, that first checks if that directory is mounted. If so, it unmounts the directory. If not, it continues. I have no errors anymore.\r\n\r\nLet me know if anybody can reproduce this bug.\r\n",

If the root is not mounted (due to a reboot), it fails.\n- When it is mounted, it umounts correctly, but then tries to umount the loop device. There is a bug in this command.\n\nAttached a patch, which will fix both issues.",
