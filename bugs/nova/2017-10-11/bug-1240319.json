A maximum of five entries is allowed, and both\n                     keys and values must be 255 characters or less.\n\nIt doesn't valid the type, size or length of the dict in the client.  Looks like the nova compute API validates the metadata in the request:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/api.py#L402\n\nLooking at the latest code, it's checking that the metadata value is a dict with a number of entries per the quota limits, and checks the entries length to make sure they are less than 255 (characters), but they don't check that the key/value pairs are strings.",

This patch adds the checks for string type on the\n    keys and values in the metadata dict.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1240319\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic4aacc342cf37d929871287e6e4917f4f48b63e8\n",
