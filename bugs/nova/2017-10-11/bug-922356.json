    "description": "QuantumManager does not initiate the call to unplug on the linux_net driver resulting in gateway devices of deleted networks being orphaned. Over a period of time this results in several unwanted devices, and it's difficult to keep track of which devices are valid and which are invalid. Manual deletion has to be performed on each device, clearly not an acceptable option in a production environment.",
