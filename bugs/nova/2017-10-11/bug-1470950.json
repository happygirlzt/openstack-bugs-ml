The package will build now and be available at https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-ironicclient/0.5.1-0ubuntu1 in a few hours, and then in the -proposed repository.\n\nPlease help us by testing this new package.  See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/EnableProposed for documentation how to enable and use -proposed.  Your feedback will aid us getting this update out to other Ubuntu users.\n\nIf this package fixes the bug for you, please add a comment to this bug, mentioning the version of the package you tested, and change the tag from verification-needed to verification-done. If it does not fix the bug for you, please add a comment stating that, and change the tag to verification-failed.  In either case, details of your testing will help us make a better decision.\n\nFurther information regarding the verification process can be found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/PerformingSRUVerification .
