    "description": "Currently the report client doesn't consisently use an accept header of 'application/json' when making requests of the placement API. This means that sometimes the bodies of the error responses are in HTML which means processing and inspection of the error response is unpredictable and unstructured. If/when placement starts including error codes in responses (as described in http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/api-wg/guidelines/errors.html ) this will be a problem.\n\nThis misfeature is an artifact of WebOb which defaults to constructing a response body based on what it perceives to be the client's desired response media type. It falls back to the text/html. Strictly speaking it is the correct behavior.\n\nBecause of the way placement is designed, it is safe to always send both content-type and accept headers of 'application/json' so we could make this most correct by changing the report client to always have the headers.",
