Why do we have AZ property for host and instance both?",

Set instance.az when booting, and always read host's az after that.\n\n2. Make instance.az be consistent with host az. That means we always need to update instance.az in db, when host az changes.\n\nThe patch that I currently making is #1. Hope other good ideas.",
