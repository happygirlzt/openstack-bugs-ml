    "description": "In finish_migration(), after resize the driver does:\n\n            if info['type'] == 'raw' and CONF.use_cow_images:\n                self._disk_raw_to_qcow2(info['path'])\n\nThis ensures that if use_cow_images is set to True, all raw disks will be converted to qcow2. This includes config disks, which isn't the intention here.\n\nA second part of this bug is that config disks are then subsequently overwritten, which also doesn't seem to be intentional. This is why this hasn't previously come to light. It is currently just very efficient: we copy the config disk, convert it to qcow2, then overwrite it with a new one. We should stop after the original copy.\n\nThis code was added here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/78626/ . I have read the change, the bug it related to, spoken to the original author, and one of the core reviewers. None of us could work out why the above code was there.",
