I know that it's still not implemented the automatic conversion from thick to thin, so after the upload I went in the ESX, accessed glance folder in the datastore, and converted the image manually to a thin disk (vmkfstools -i...).\n\nThen when I launch an instance the disk is thin, so the image is ok.\n\nBut when I take a snapshot, the image created seems to ignore the previous properties, creating an image with vmware_disktype=preallocated, occupying a lot more of space in the data store.",
