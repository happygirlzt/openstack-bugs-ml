This leads to\n    potentially confusing situations when triaging problems in the\n    cloud environment.\n    \n    This patch corrects the error message based on the operation; we use\n    the flavor IDs as a way to determine what operation is really being\n    performed. In the case of a resize, different flavor IDs will be\n    used and they will be indentical in the case of a cold migration.\n    \n    Note there was a lot of IRC discussion on this as well in terms of\n    the \"algorithm\" to check the operation type; the flavor ID check\n    is also used in the API layer as well since it's the only way you\n    can determine this given the underlying operation.  We also tried\n    to make the error message more general, but the consensus was that\n    was pretty unfriendly from the user's perspective - so we've landed\n    with this approach again with the end users close to heart.  :-)\n    \n    Change-Id: I762425b2602c2798b94d3c770f2401dd0aedc942\n    Closes-Bug: #1364692\n",
