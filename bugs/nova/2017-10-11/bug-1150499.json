For this reason it was removed from the openstack api layer.\n    The behaviour of the call remains the same, only the functionality has\n    been moved.\n    \n    This patch makes the functionality automatically work in cells.\n    \n    Work towards: bug #1150499\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia9489f11608167aed5168ccb3b670f395f7de5f7\n",
