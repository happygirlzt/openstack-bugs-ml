I boot an instances using the boot-from-volumes extension, and specify the 2 disks such as disk1 should be attached to /dev/vda and disk2 to /dev/vdb. When the instance is launched it fails to boot, because it tries to find the root-filesystem on disk2 instead.\n\nThe underlying problem is with virsh/libvirt. Boot fails because in the libvirt.xml file created by Openstack, disk2 (/dev/vdb) is listed before disk1 (/dev/vda). So, what happens is that the hypervisor attaches disk2 first (since its listed first in the XML). Therefore when these disks are attached on the guest, disk2 appears as /dev/vda and disk1 as /dev/vdb. Later the kernel tries to find the root filesystem on '/dev/vda' (because that's what is selected as the root) and it fails for obvious reason. I think it's a virsh bug. It should be smart about it and attach the devices in the right order.",

Rather I think it should be committed at first because it would take long time to attack long term solution. It needs to fix not only nova but also other component like kvm, libvirt.\r\nThe reason why xen case(AWS) works is such information is passed to drivers in kernel  via xenstore. On the other hand KVM lacks such framework yet. \r\n\r\nWhen short term work around is committed,  \r\nplease put on the comment on the code that it's work around,\r\nand please don't mark this bug fixed, keep this bug open until the long term solution is committed.",
