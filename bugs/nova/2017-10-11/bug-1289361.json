This is shared between\n    spawn and resize. As spawn wants to resize the root disk, resize=True\n    during the spawn operation.\n    \n    The code in _attach_disks correctly deals with empty ephemeral disks,\n    but the code in _resize_up_vdis did not, and failed due to\n    ephemeral_vdis being None.\n    \n    This is a quick fix for the issue. We need some refactoring in this area\n    so there is, ideally, only one place that generates ephemeral disks.\n    \n    Change-Id: If058c5c17c2ed76569fd98d4a3d8e5274721fbd0\n    Closes-Bug: #1289361\n",
