For example\n    reboot and rebuild are useful recover options for\n    an instance which has reached an error state, but\n    not if the instance failed during its initial build.\n    \n    With this change the only actions allowed on an\n    instance which has never booted successfully are\n    delete and force_delete.  Soft delete is not\n    allowed, as the restore is in effect a start unless\n    there is specific virt driver support.\n    \n    In addition the following actions are now allowed\n    against instances in an Error state providing the\n    instance has booted at least once:  Reboot, Rebuild,\n    and Rescue.\n    \n    Fixes bug:   1183946\n    \n    Change-Id: I63fd8d2a182df5cf12754892e8076933b3b1e79f\n",
