See the way the opts are registered with register_cli_opt()\n\nAgain, the sample conf file generator just needs to use opt.dest not opt.name\n\n -    opt_name, opt_default, opt_help = opt.name, opt.default, opt.help\n +    opt_name, opt_default, opt_help = opt.dest, opt.default, opt.help\n\n\n",

Use opt.dest rather than\n    opt.name as the config file key. Fixes bug #1034970.\n    \n    DocImpact: update nova.conf docs\n    Change-Id: Ia7f3dded9148deedeb198c19a8d343db6dd93f99\n",
