    "description": "Currently SQLAlchemy uses the MySQLdb library to connect with MySQL. This being a C-based library it is immune to eventlet's monkey patching and thus only one SQL connection is made and one SQL query can be executed at a single time. This is border-line bug and feature request but I have chosen bug because any API should be able to handle multiple long-running SQL queries while processing other SQL-required queries.",
