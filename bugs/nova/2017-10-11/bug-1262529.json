            "content": "HI Yair,\nAs I know, if you use quantum/neutron to associate floating ip.\n1. First the neutron-server will update FloatingIP table in database (which will make the `neutron floatingip-show` command show the floating ip that has associated with port,  actually the flaoting ip hasn't associate with port), then notify l3-agent to update qrouter device and nat rules. (https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/db/l3_db.py#L659)\n2. l3-agent periodically update routeres (assocate floating ip to qrouter device and apply nat rules.) every 60 seconds which is the default value (https://github.com/openstack/neutron/blob/master/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py#L733)\nAfter this step, floating ip will can be pinged.\n3. Nova compute also periodically update InstanceInfoCache table which is queried by `nova show <instance>` command every 60 seconds which is the default value. (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py#L4391)\n\nThe reason of this issue I guess maybe is that l3-agent or nova compute has something wrong when run periodical tasks.\nmaybe l3-agent/nova-compute is to busy to run periodical tasks.\nmaybe the peridoical task raise excepitons.\n\nAbout the timeout value in tempest to test floating ip, I think 120 seconds is the mininum value.\nif we want to check out who make the floating ip not appear in `nova show` command.\nwe can first check step 2 (but this step is not easy to check, maybe using the default value 60 seconds to check. which is checking the floating ip connectivity with a timeout of 60  seconds),\nthen check step 3.\n\nMaybe my understanding of floating ip is not completely correct, so how do you think?",

The floating IPs seem to work right away but the delay for them to show on nova list is strange.\n",
