This change\n    fixes those tests by only attempting the action on nova-compute services.\n    \n    This change also deprecates the binary argument to the service\n    enable/disable/force-down commands since the only value that ever really\n    worked or does anything is nova-compute, so a future version of the CLI\n    should just hard-code that value.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idd0d2be960ca0ed59097c10c931da47a1a3e66fb\n    Closes-Bug: #1700359\n",
