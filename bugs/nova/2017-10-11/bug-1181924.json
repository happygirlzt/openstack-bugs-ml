    "description": "When rebooting an instance in libvirt 1.x, before changing the ID of the instance, libvirt will place the instance in 'shutdown' state. nova code for doing soft reboot doesn't cover that case. Cause of that, it will try creating an VM that's already running. As a chain reaction, instance will power off and never power on again.",

This means that there's a race\n    condition during reboot where nova might try to create an\n    instance that's already defined. By checking if the ID of\n    the new and old instance is the same, we avoid that situation\n    and reiterate on the loop.\n    \n    The tests for this are added in\n    I6215f80bd15820dac80151e7063916dbbc21d761\n    \n    Change-Id: I493b828f0c6848fbadc591be2f47fd1b12fd3a51\n    Fixes: bug 1181924\n",
