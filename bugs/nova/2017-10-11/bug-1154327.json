The libvirt driver would raise InstanceNotFound.  The xenapi\n    driver would raise InstanceNotReady.\n    \n    This patch moves the handling of this race that was in the xenapi driver\n    up to the compute manager.  Now, all of the virt drivers that support\n    this method (libvirt, xenapi, vmware) will all raise InstanceNotFound in\n    this case, and the compute manager will convert it into InstanceNotReady\n    IFF the vm_state is BUILDING.\n    \n    Related to bug 1154327.\n    \n    Change-Id: I68f4a6db8aac26c6f731c985d97299ee38c34448\n",

This exception is\n    raised in the compute manager.  The explanation in the exception will\n    include the traceback from the manager side.  If we use this as the\n    explanation, we end up with a traceback in the API log, even though it's\n    just an INFO log message.\n    \n    Use a more basic explanation, which is accuately more consistent with\n    other cases of raising HTTP exceptions, which doesn't include a\n    traceback.\n    \n    Fix bug 1154327.\n    \n    Change-Id: Idca443165983289a0df40970f68f95d5550ce72a\n",
