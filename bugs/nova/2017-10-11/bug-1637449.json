            "content": "The logic here [0] indeed seems to be incorrect, eg in case of there is\na node in available state with instance_uuid set, first the driver will\nreport vcpus=vcpus_used=properties['vcpus'] and then will set vcpus=0\nleaving vcpus_used intact.\n\nMy proposal here is the following:\n\n* If there is an instance_uuid on the node, no matter what provision/power\n  state it's in, consider the resources as used. In case it's an orphan,\n  an admin will need to take some manual action anyway.\n\n* If there is no instance_uuid and a node is in cleaning/clean wait after\n  tear down, it is a part of normal node lifecycle, report all resources\n  as used. This means we need a way to determine if it's a manual or\n  automated clean.\n\n* If there is no instance_uuid, and a node:\n  - has a bad power state or\n  - is in maintenance\n  - manual clean is happening\n  or actually in any other case, consider it unavailable, report available\n  resources = used resources = 0. Provision state does not matter in this\n  logic, all cases that we wanted to take into account are described in\n  the first two bullets.\n\n[0] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/1506c36b4446f6ba1487a2d68e4b23cb3fca44cb/nova/virt/ironic/driver.py#L262",
