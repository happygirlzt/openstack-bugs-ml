This change ensures that we skip the\n    metadata updates when this occurs.\n    \n    Currently, if this happens, the long running task, like rebuild or\n    resize will fail because the VM task_state=None and is put into ERROR.\n    After this change, it will silently fail, and the updated metadata will\n    be written when the VM gets re-created as part of the long running\n    operation.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1207238\n    Change-Id: I75e1f93e34d3b3ab93a8e8104fd64224f72d7309\n",
