So this needs some extra care. Note that we already do conditional skipping with skip_test... is there a specific feature missing there ?",

I too feel that moving to unittest2 is necessary for additional support of skipIf and more features. \n\nBased on this, my branch (lp:~rohitkarajgi/nova/libvirt_unittests) should get merged only after Brian's libvirt_refactoring branch is merged, to incorporate usage of unittest2.skipIf().",
