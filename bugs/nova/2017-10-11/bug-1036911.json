It appears that this was done so\n    that more advanced schedulers could handle the request as one\n    batch, but the result is the scheduler is sometimes slow enough\n    that the call will timeout.\n    \n    Instead this converts to always creating the instance records\n    locally and making run_instance into a casting instead of a call.\n    \n    This made a small change to the rpc api for run instance, so the\n    version was bumped. Legacy messages are still handled properly.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1036911\n    \n    Co-authored-by: Chris Behrens <email address hidden>\n    \n    Change-Id: I63bbc98c285faebec53f8e62857c01548807db68\n",
