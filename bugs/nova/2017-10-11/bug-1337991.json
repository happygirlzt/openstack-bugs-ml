Just to clarify - nova absolute-limits has the following options: nova absolute-limits [--tenant [<tenant>]] [--reserved]\n\nAre you saying that \"nova absolute-limits\" should just return the user quotas, and \"nova absolute-limits --tenant foobar\" should return the project quotas?  More specifically:\n\n\"nova absolute-limits\" should call: QUOTAS.get_user_quotas(context, project_id, user_id)\n\"nova absolute-limits --tenant foobar\" should call: QUOTAS.get_project_quotas(context, project_id)\n\n\nOr are you saying that the list of limits returned should combine the results (which would require a nova-spec I think)?  For example:\n+-----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n| Quota                                    | Limit | Project Limit |\n+-----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n| instances                              | 10       | 20                       |\n| cores                                      | 20       | 40                      |\n| ram                                         | 51200 | 102400             |\n...\n+-----------------------------+-------+----------------+\n\n",

So I think the only clean way to fix this is to provide both the user and project values in the same response - and that is an API change that probably would need a nova-spec.",
