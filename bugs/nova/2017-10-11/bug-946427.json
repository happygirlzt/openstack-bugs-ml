For example, any\n    of the following three commands would result in opening everything:\n    \n        euca-authorize -P icmp -o test-ports test-ports\n        euca-authorize -P tcp -o test-ports test-ports\n        euca-authorize -P udp -o test-ports test-ports\n    \n    This patch resolves this and these commands now only open the protocol\n    that was specified.  Unit tests have been added to verify the fix and\n    also verify that this only works when a source group is specified.\n    While the bug was originally reported against the EC2 API, the same\n    updates and similar unit tests have gone in to the equivalent code for\n    the OpenStack API.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4c87c5f5f4ccee60c6c16da4e659d73ab3f4a34f\n",
