New rows\n    are only created on the 1st bandwidth update for an instance or when\n    the audit period rolls over.  This cuts down DB queries to 1 for the\n    'update' case.\n    \n    Added bonus:\n    Remove unused 'import inspect' in compute manager.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie5f6c919676046d817b842138dc9d17d1115d3c0\n",
