We assumed, that every project / tenant should get its own virtual network segment out of the defined range of ip nets in the fixed-range flag in nova.conf.\n\nWhen I create a new network with, e.g.\n\nCode: Select all\n    nova-manage network create projnet 192.168.5.0/24 2 128\n\n: How does Open Stack knows, that it should belong to the previously created project??\n\nI used \"nova-manage network create --help\" to find out, that there are some additional options available for the nova-manage network create statement (e.g.):\n\nCode: Select all\n      --project_id=<project id>\n                            Project id\n      --label=<label>       Label for network (ex: public)\n\n\nWhenever I used them in one of my statements the appropriate project field is still empty.\n\nCode: Select all\n    root@c2n2:/usr/share/pyshared/nova/network# nova-manage project create proj2 projadmin\n    root@c2n2:/usr/share/pyshared/nova/network# nova-manage network create projnet4 192.168.7.0/24 1 128 --project_id=proj2\n    root@c2n2:/usr/share/pyshared/nova/network# nova-manage network list\n    id      IPv4                    IPv6            start address   DNS1            DNS2            VlanID          project         uuid\n    1       192.168.4.0/24          None            192.168.4.2     8.8.4.4         None            None            None            None\n    2       192.168.5.0/25          None            192.168.5.2     8.8.4.4         None            None            None            None\n    3       192.168.5.128/25        None            192.168.5.130   8.8.4.4         None            None            None            None\n    4       192.168.6.0/25          None            192.168.6.2     8.8.4.4         None            None            None            None\n    5       192.168.7.0/25          None            192.168.7.2     8.8.4.4         None            None            None            None\n\n\n\nAlso the corresponding fields in the table \"networks\" are empty.\n\nSo how does Openstack manage associations between network and different projects?\n\nThank you for answering my question in advance.\n\n----------------------\n\nAnswer by: mjfork \u00bb Thu Dec 08, 2011 7:58 pm\nI tried this a few separate ways and it did not work for me as well. I traced the code and, while I see nova-manage passing on project_id to the create_networks call, I do not see where create_networks makes use of it. I would suggest opening a bug report in launchpad. Please post the link if you do in case others with a similar problem come across this.\n\nAs a workaround, you could go into the mysql database and do\n\nmysql> SELECT id, vlan from networks;\nmysql> UPDATE networks SET project_id=<numerical id> WHERE id = <numerical id from previous call>;\n\nWhere to get the project_id will depend on if you are using keystone or nova authentication. I believe this will only work if the network has not been previously used.\nMichael Fork",
