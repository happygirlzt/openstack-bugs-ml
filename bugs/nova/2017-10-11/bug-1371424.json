    "description": "Each AWS describe operation has common and some custom filter parameters to filter result set by various object attributes. But Nova EC2 supports filters by object ids only.\n\nI found similar ancient bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/734912, but it's closed with 'invalid' resolution. As i understand it refers to a blueprint which proposes to implement this feature by enhancement of native Nova filter capability. But there was no activity in this blueprint for the last 3 years.\n\nI believe we could implement EC2 filters in EC2 layer mostly, using the existing filtering capabilities of OS services (Nova, Glance, Cinder). If insufficient performance of filtering operation by some attribute will be found later, we will optimize it by moving filtering by this attribute to an appropriate OS service.",
