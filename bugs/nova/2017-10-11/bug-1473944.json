            "content": "@gs-opencos-zte:\n\nSounds like an issue with \"facter\" from \"PuppetLabs\" which configures OpenStack. Their issue tracker is at [1] and not at Launchpad, so I cannot add it as affected project. OpenStack doesn't have control over \"facter\". I think it makes sense to open an issue at [1] and close this one as \"Invalid\". If you think this is wrong and OpenStack has to fix something, reopen this bug by setting it to \"New\" and add an explanation.\n\n[1] https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:issues-panel",
