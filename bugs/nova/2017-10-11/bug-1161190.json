However, I can see that it would be better to set it to the current value of the default instances quota -- i.e. if you changed the default instance quota, this should change too.\n\nWould that mitigate your concern? It wouldn't work for users where you have grown their instance quota though...\n\nI'm hesitant to allow an unlimited quota here because that reopens the DoS window that this quota was added to close.",
