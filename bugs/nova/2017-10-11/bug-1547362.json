Inject_nmi is\n    just a libvirt implementation. The driver API name should be\n    \"trigger_crash_dump\" for the abstraction.\n    \n    This patch only changes names of the driver API and an Exception. It has no\n    functional changes.\n    \n    Change-Id: Icef57d346fac7f92132bc14e22d5b2652397a64a\n    Closes-Bug: 1547362\n",
