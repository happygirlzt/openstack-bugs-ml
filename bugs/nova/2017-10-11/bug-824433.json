For example, a QCow2 image is instantiated and a snapshot of this image is created. The snapshot image is in RAW format but the metadata 'disk_format' of the snapshot image is 'QCow2'\n\nI think, nova-compute should not convert the image for a snapshot. If the image is in QCow2 format, snapshots are in QCow2 format also. If the image is in RAW format, the snapshots are in RAW format also.\n\nPerhaps, we can add a flag to force the snapshot format.\n\nRelated question: https://answers.launchpad.net/nova/+question/167301\n\nI tested to change the command 'qemu-img convert' by : 'qemu_img_cmd = (FLAGS.qemu_img, 'convert', '-f', 'qcow2', '-O', 'qcow2', '-s', snapshot_name, disk_path, out_path)' in method 'snapshot' of class 'LibvirtConnection'. It works nicely.",
