When using neutron+openvswitch, the ovs\n    agent on compute node cannot run correctly due to lack of qbr linux\n    bridge on compute node. This change will add qbr linux bridge when\n    xenserver as hypervisor\n    Xenserver driver now doesn't have linux bridge, the connection is:\n    compute node: vm-vif -> br-int -> br-eth\n    network node: br-eth -> br-int -> br-ex\n    With this implemented, linux bridge(qbr) will be added in compute\n    node. Thus the security group rules can be applied on qbr bridge.\n    The connection will look like:\n    compute node: vm-vif -> qbr(linux bridge) -> br-int -> br-eth\n    network node: br-eth -> br-int -> br-ex\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1526138\n    \n    Implements: blueprint support-neutron-security-group\n    \n    DocImpact: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-bridge file in dom0 should be\n        deleted since it prevent loading linux bridge module in dom0\n    \n    Depends-On: I377f8ad51e1d2725c3e0153e64322055fcce7b54\n    \n    Change-Id: Id9b39aa86558a9f7099caedabd2d517bf8ad3d68\n",
