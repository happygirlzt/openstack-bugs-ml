    "description": "The \"boot\" and \"list\" commands in nova don't seem to be sequentially consistent. Doing performance testing on the latest openstack code, I occasionally observe that the instance is not in the output of \"nova list\". If I re-request the list a moment later, the instance is almost always there (i.e., \"show\" and \"list\" are eventually consistent).\n\nNote that above, when I saw \"nova ...\", I'm not using the command-line nova client tool. Instead, I'm issuing the requests from the same process with the same novaclient.client.Client instance. The delay between invocations of the nova command-line tool would hide the race I'm observing.\n\nI observe this problem fairly rarely; roughly once per 100 instances booted.\n\nMy suspicion is that the inconsistency arises from how nova-api interacts with the database. Thus it's pertinent to note that I'm running with 20 osapi workers.\n\nI'm using mysql.",
