In our current code it checks if this is a proper uuid\n    and sends it down the uuid path, everything else gets dispatched to\n    the version that selects by integer id. This means that arbitrary\n    garbage fuzzed server ids will get sent down the int path, all the way\n    to the database.\n    \n    In postgresql, where the db is strongly typed, this causes a type error.\n    This error was found by tempest nightly runs where we send some 35 and 37\n    character strings in.\n    \n    This patch creates and equivalent is_int_like function. If the server_id\n    is neither uuid_like nor int_like, we throw the InstanceNotFound exception\n    early. This also saves us a trip to the database in these cases.\n    \n    Make the is_int_like a little more robust, and don't succeed on floats\n    \n    Once more with feeling, to let us actually use is_int_like on ints, not\n    just strings.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1100253\n    \n    Change-Id: If4ae8005fd33a23ac50a6408ecd5933a2ff6425c\n",
