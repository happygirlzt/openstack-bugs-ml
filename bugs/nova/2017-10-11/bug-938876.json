The result is that when attempting to attach an SF Volume to an instance, new multi-lun features added to the Volume Driver will cause a default value of lun = 1 to be used which is invalid for SF devices (all Volumes are lun 0).\n\nTo fix this we simply need to add the lun number to the model_update['provider_location']  on Volume creation.  I have the change tested,  just need a bug to get into Geritt.",
