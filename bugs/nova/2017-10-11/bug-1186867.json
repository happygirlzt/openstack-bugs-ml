If the former, this seems like maybe a need for clearer wording in the documentation to set appropriate expectations along with a hardening feature request. If the latter, then I agree this is an information leak vulnerability (but a low one, because relying on the secrecy of your network topology to protect you from an attacker is a serious case of security by obscurity in my opinion).",
