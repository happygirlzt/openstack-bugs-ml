Voelker <email address hidden>\nDate:   Thu Feb 5 11:38:24 2015 -0500\n\n    Fix references to non-existent \"pause\" section\n    \n    Two sections of the hypervisor support matrix refer readers to the\n    sections of the document dealing with the \"pause\" operation.\n    Although there is a section in the raw .ini file called\n    \"[operation.pause]\", this doesn't appear at all in the rendered\n    version of document since it's title is set to\n    \"Stop instance CPUs\".  This renders readers of the rendered\n    document unable to find sections being referenced.\n    \n    This patch clears up the confusion by changing the references\n    to refer to \"Stop instance CPUs\" rather than \"pause\".\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia97d8e400db3a11291a715f6a630ea8bc638993e\n    Closes-bug: #1418641\n",
