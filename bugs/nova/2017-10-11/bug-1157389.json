Name label is used\n    to get vm ref and currently the original instance is being\n    referenced even when in rescue mode. If rescue vm is not ready\n    yet, InstanceNotReady is raised.\n    \n    Added tests cases for xenapi get_vnc_console for instance\n    and rescue mode.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1157389\n    \n    Change-Id: I5438103d517c40c1c87ddecd5f88b1487bfc0339\n",
