However, after some attempts we figured out the documentation is not correct. Turns out this parameter is an object, not a String as described. A working example to the request would look something like this:\n\nbody = {\n    'addFloatingIp': {\n        'address': '172.24.4.5',\n        'fixed_address': '10.0.0.10'\n    }\n}\n\nPlease fix this parameter on the docs, and also add a working example.\nThanks!",
