There appears to be some significant issues around race-conditions caused by udev-settle, though to be quite honest I don't fully understand all of these things yet.\n\nI should also add sheepishly, I'm not even sure what versions of Ubuntu for example no longer pull this in by default, it seems that RedHat still does (again, I could be wrong, but first glance that appears to be the case).\n\n_med: any info on this based on the work you've been looking in to so far?",
