    "description": "Currently, the nova Hyper-V driver does not wait for neutron vif plug events (or, in case of other drivers, nova-compute can be configured not to wait for neutron vif plug events), which means that by the time the VM becomes ACTIVE, there's no guarantee that the ports have been bound and became ACTIVE. Because, of this, some tests which require connecting to the VM via a floating ip, will randomly fail [1], as tempest will filter out ports that are not active, raising an exception [2].\n\n[1] http://paste.openstack.org/show/584712/\n[2] https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/tempest/scenario/manager.py#L800",
