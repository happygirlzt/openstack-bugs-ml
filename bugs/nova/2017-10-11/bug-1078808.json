    "description": "I have a multi host environment with VLAN networking running and all works fine except DNS resolving between instances on different compute nodes.\n\nFor example assume that there are 3 instances running (call them x, y and z) and 2 of them run on compute node A (x,y) and the third instance (z) runs on node B. The VMs x and y can access each other via their assigned DNS names (respectively x.novalocal and y.novalocal) but the VMs can not resolve the DNS for the third one (z.novalocal). And vice versa, the VM y cannot resolve VMs x and y.\n\nProblem here is that each compute node has his own dnsmasq and mange its own local DNS entries but other compute nodes does not know how to access this information.\n\nThe workaround is to setup some external DNS if I want resolution between hosts.",
