Without\n    list_instance_uuids being implemented in xenapi, there's a fallback to\n    querying all instances on the host.  Because of read_deleted='yes', this\n    queries all instances that have ever lived on the host.  In a very busy\n    environment where instances are repeatedly built and destroyed, one can\n    end up with thousands of deleted instances.  Now that we are storing\n    instance_type data in system_metadata and system_metadata is joined with\n    every instance_get, this results in 10x the number of rows being\n    returned with sqlalchemy... the fallback doesn't perform well enough.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4bbfd69c9769807cec813af757665f03d9643460\n",
