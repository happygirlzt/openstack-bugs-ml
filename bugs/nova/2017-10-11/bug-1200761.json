In order for that to happen, nova needs to\n    send in additional information in its headers to glanceclient.\n    More details:\n    Some deployments have everything in the same network. And\n    for long running snapshots this may cause 401s because\n    token expires. In these cases the reauth is not required\n    cause nova has already authenticated the user.\n    This patch does not convert it to no auth. It only makes\n    it optional for glance users who do want to use that option.\n    Related patches:\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/37062/\n    https://review.openstack.org/#/c/36563/\n    \n    Resolves bug 1200761\n    \n    Change-Id: Ife02059abbdce7920f1f408b71e9745d777fa770\n",
