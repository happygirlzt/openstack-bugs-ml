    "description": "When using the eventlet backdoor for troubleshooting, it can sometimes interfere with the global _ symbol that gettext installs. It can often manifest itself as an exception similar to this:\n\nTypeError: 'dict' object is not callable\n\nWith the type varying.\n\nThe problem is the default sys.displayhook function. It will take the return value of the last expression, print it and then set it to __builtin__._, which is also the variable that gettext sets to allow _() to be used to internationalize strings.\n\nAn attempt to workaround the problem was implemented, but it does not always work.\n\nThe fix is to implement a new sys.displayhook that plays nicer with gettext.",
