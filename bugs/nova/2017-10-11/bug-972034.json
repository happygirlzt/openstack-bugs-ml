    "description": "1. Nova uses -1 as its special value for configuring unlimited quotas. \n2. The Nova API sends \"None\" for an unlimited quota.\n3. Novaclient strips out \"None\" in the quota update code, so you can't send a None/null.\n4. Sending a -1 through novaclient works, but isn't treated specially and thus -1 is sent back when the quota is retrieved instead of None.\n\nThis inconsistency makes working with unlimited quotas via the API very very difficult.\n\n(Also, the quotas API happily accepts any negative number, which seems rather broken.)",
