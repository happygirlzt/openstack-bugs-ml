In this case, using oslo.middleware.cors means that *every other project* that loads the middleware gets this application's defaults when the generator is run on a system with everything installed (such as a dev box with devstack). Use the name of the app instead, to ensure that the defaults are only set when this app's sample config and documentation are being generated.\"\n\nNOTE:\n=====\nThis bug report is based on Doug's post on the ML [1] and is only opened to track the blocking of the RC (in this week). At best the patch [2] merges today and everything is fine for the RC.\n\nReferences:\n[1] [openstack-dev] [all][oslo] config generator default overrides and namespaces:\nhttp://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-March/089123.html\n[2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/291910/1",
