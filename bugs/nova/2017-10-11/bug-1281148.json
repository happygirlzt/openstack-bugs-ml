This patch changes the delay calculation by setting the max\n    delay to 5s and by changing the way it is increased.\n    \n    Unfortunately, this is one of the places where both our main drivers are\n    not consistent. Rabbit's driver uses configuration parameters for this\n    whereas qpid's driver has never had one. However, I would prefer not\n    adding configuration paremeters to qpid's driver for the following\n    reasons:\n    \n        1. Most of OpenStack services depend on the messaging layer, hence\n        they need it to be available. A 5s delay seems to be reasonable and\n        I could argue the need of tune it further. Although so frequent\n        reconnects can add load to the network, that wouldn't be the main\n        issue if one of the brokers go down.\n        2. We're trying to move away from configuration options towards using\n        transport URL. This path is still not clear and I would\n        prefer avoiding adding new options until we clear it out.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1281148\n    \n    Change-Id: I537015f452eb770acba41fdedfe221628f52a920\n    (cherry picked from commit 8b628d1e024f787dbb93d508117d9148388c0590)\n",
