As every function in Nova has a argument named\n    `context`, so argnames will always start with `context`.\n    \n    In nova/exception.py#81, *args is a list of arguments which does not\n    start with\n    `context`, however, argnames starts with `context`, this will lead to a\n    mismatching when zip it into a dict.\n    \n    Solution for this is that when calling getcallargs(), pass context as\n    one argument.\n    \n    Change-Id: I4ce81e1862fb2d741f15747b04aa6bf1a2243364\n    Fixes: bug #1207153\n",
