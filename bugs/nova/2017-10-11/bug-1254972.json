This particular call is not something that Nova actually needs, this an quite a few others are just still there as backward compat from when we switched from Nova-Volumes.  We kept the functionality of the novaclient to do volume-xxxx.\n\nThis is actually might be a bit of an issue as most of us on the Cinder side aren't updating/maintaining the volume code in novaclient.  Not sure if we want to remove this extension or just update it and modify the tempest test to use a force-delete maybe?",

We should keep it open for now, but if somebody sees this again we need the link to the actual test failure.\n\nThe method of submitting the queries is catching multiple results making it kinda confusing to try and debug/triage these.",

Nikola and I found this in the ec2 paths recently as well.\n\nI realistically believe this is probably one of the key root issues in why the volumes tests end up somewhat unreliable. I suspect that if we really cranked up the tests in this area we'd get a 100% failure rate over these kinds of races.",
