But sometimes users want to either\n    launch min_count instances or nothing. So deprecate --num-instances\n    and use --min-count and --max-count instead.\n    \n    DocImpact: deprecate '--num-instances' for 'nova boot'\n    \n    Change-Id: If0088aef554a528258799b22c6e793541474cb0d\n    Closes-bug: #1309244\n",
