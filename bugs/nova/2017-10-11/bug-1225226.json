This adds some translation handling to\n    the FaultWrapper so we can get these messages localized\n    to the client's language specified in the Accept-Language\n    header.\n    \n    Additionally adds a test to verfiy FaultWrapper is\n    translating any exception messages that can be.\n    \n    fixes bug 1225226\n    \n    Change-Id: I3847cff0ac4b37f57eb04b27150c4e0d1ea23f29\n",
