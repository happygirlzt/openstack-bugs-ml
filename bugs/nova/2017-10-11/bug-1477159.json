This is required to identify the vmdk\n    to be removed during volume detach. But the key-value pair\n    added during volume attach is not deleted during detach.\n    This patch deletes the relevant key-value pair from VM's\n    extra config during volume detach.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1477159\n    Change-Id: Id4d5e2eede5e1d2418f301045fb2b3542a39b471\n",
