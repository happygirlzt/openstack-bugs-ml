In v2 now, the 409 error is raised too. But the\n    error msg is like \"Instance is in an invalid state for \\'pause(action name)\\'\".\n    The error msg is inappropriate, two points:\n    1. the state is valid for pause\n    2. the message doesn't tell that the instance is locked\n    \n    The patch fixes the ploblem, and will do as v3. See the v3 commit:\n    2c9fca6a3c916f3f594ddbb1a8ee8946b8ea3ac7\n    \n    Change-Id: I76572e37af686a4af35c31a3ea27f7070894b88a\n    Closes-Bug: #1255386\n",
