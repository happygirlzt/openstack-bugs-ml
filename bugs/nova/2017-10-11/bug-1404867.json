This patch was later re-reverted [4]\n    due to continued jenkins race conditions.\n    \n    The patch [5] intended to avoid the jenkins race condition by leaving\n    the flow for instances in the BUILDING state unchanged and only calling\n    _local_delete() on instances in the shelved_offloaded or error states\n    when the instance has no host associated with it. It however also had\n    to be reverted [6] because of yet another race condition.\n    \n    This version takes a more minimal approach of adding the ERROR state\n    to the logic for doing a local delete plus cleanup of resources on\n    a compute host. Comments have also been added to the existing code\n    to explain more about the different flows.\n    \n    [1] Ic630ae7d026a9697afec46ac9ea40aea0f5b5ffb\n    [2] Id4e405e7579530ed1c1f22ccc972d45b6d185f41\n    [3] Ic107d8edc7ee7a4ebb04eac58ef0cdbf506d6173\n    [4] Ibcbe35b5d329b183c4d0e8233e8ada26ebc512c2\n    [5] I928a397c75b857e94bf5c002e50ec43a2bed9848\n    [6] I6b9b886e0d6f2ec86141c048fb50969bccf5cb30\n    \n    Co-Authored-By: Ankit Agrawal <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: Samuel Matzek <email address hidden>\n    Co-Authored-By: melanie witt <email address hidden>\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1404867\n    Closes-Bug: 1408527\n    \n    Change-Id: I2192ef513a2cd15d21e9d5d5fe22c5a5fbae0941\n",
