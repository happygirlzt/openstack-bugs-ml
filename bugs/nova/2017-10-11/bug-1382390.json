For example, when a request to create an instance was in-progress, kill the nova-api may lead to quota not sync or odd database records. Especially in large-scale development, there are hundreds of request in a second, kill the nova-api will interrupt lots in-process greenlet.\n\nIn nova/wsgi.py, when stoping WSGI service, we first shrink the greenlet pool size to 0, then kill the eventlet wsgi server. The work around is quick and easy: wait for all greenlets in the pool to finish, then kill wsgi server.
