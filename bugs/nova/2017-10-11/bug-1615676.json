This\n    means it was entirely possible that it was run before things like\n    logging were actually set up in the expected way. Move this back into\n    execution time instead of load time to ensure that logging is actually\n    setup.\n    \n    Changes need to be made to tests which make assumptions about os_vif\n    objects to manually initialize os_vif when it will be used. os_vif\n    objects can't be created until it is initialized, so some delayed\n    object creation is also done in test_vif.py.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1615676\n    \n    Change-Id: I89fe5c5b3d762f3a3238b587685df85d15ee56c4\n",
