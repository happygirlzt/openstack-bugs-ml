We cannot have two devices on the same controller with the same unit number.\n\nCurrently, the selection of unit numbers is spread all over the driver code, leaking to high-level functions like spawn() and rescue(). We need to factor this out into helper functions which take care of choosing a proper unit number and creating additional controllers if needed.\n\nHigh-level functions need to communicate only the intent like 'attach CDROM' or 'attach disk' and shouldn't bother with details like unit numbers.",
