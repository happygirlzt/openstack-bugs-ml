    "description": "Certain operating systems (namely non-server version of Microsoft Windows) limits the number of physical CPUs (sockets) to two without restricting the number of cores per socket.  This effective limits the number of VPUs that can be assigned to a non-server of Microsoft Windows to two.  The administrator should be able to configure the VCPU/core topology as metadata for images in glance.  This would also address problems with software licensed based on a certain number of physical processors.",

            "content": "I had first imagined that something like this could work\n\n      # glance image-update \\\n                   --property hw_cpu_topology=sockets:2,cores:4,threads:2 \\\n                   f16-x86_64-openstack-sda\n\n\nThe complexity is that the same image can be booted with different flavours, each of which can have different CPU count assigned.  Just because the topology says that sockets=2, cores=4, threads=2, does not mean that the guest has to be given 2x4x2 ==16 vcpus though. It is permissible to partially populate the sockets, but the cores * threads value provides a lower bound - you can't have a 4 core cpu with only 3 cores present !\n\nGiven this it might be nicer to just express a preference for cores/sockets against the image, and let nova have more flexibility to assign them eg\n\n      # glance image-update \\\n                   --property hw_cpu_topology=max_sockets:2 \\\n                   f16-x86_64-openstack-sda\n\nwould tell nova that the guest image can't cope with more than 2 sockets, so to expose > 2 vcpus, Nova must configure a suitable number of cores or threads.\n",
