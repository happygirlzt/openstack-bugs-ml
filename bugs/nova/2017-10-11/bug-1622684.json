Recent QEMU / KVM and GTK-VNC releases support a VNC extension for\nsending raw keycodes, instead of localized keysyms. Thus is best to leave\noff the keymap in the config, and just configure it inside the guest OS.\"\n\nSo the proper fix seems to be to have nova default to vnc.keymap = None from the start.",
