This\n    can be very slow for large images, and wastes bandwidth as well as\n    disk space.\n    \n    When the glance image is stored in the same ceph cluster, the data is\n    being pulled out and pushed back in unnecessarily. Instead, create a\n    copy-on-write clone of the image. This is fast, and does not depend\n    on the size of the image. Instead of taking minutes, booting takes\n    seconds, and is not limited by the disk copy.\n    \n    Add some rbd utility functions from cinder to support cloning and\n    let the rbd imagebackend rely on librbd instead of the rbd\n    command line tool for checking image existence.\n    \n    Add an ImageHandler for rbd that does the cloning if an applicable\n    image location is available. If no such location is available, or rbd\n    is not configured for ephemeral disks, this handler does nothing, so\n    enable it by default.\n    \n    blueprint rbd-clone-image-handler\n    Closes-bug: 1226351\n    Change-Id: I9b77a50206d0eda709df8356faaeeba35d232f22\n    Signed-off-by: Josh Durgin <email address hidden>\n    Signed-off-by: Zhi Yan Liu <email address hidden>\n",
