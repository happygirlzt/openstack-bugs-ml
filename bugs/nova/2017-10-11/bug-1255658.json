            "content": "\"nova show\" will show \"Error:\" status on that instance.\n\nUpon further experiment, it does seem something related to the Rabbitmq resource limits (I think the node is running against the limit on \"memory threshold\"). I was able to launch the same-size instance on another node with more free RAMs, manually (nova boot --availability-zone nova:<the other node>).  \n\nBut then the question is if Nova scheduler is working properly, I tried both the default Simple scheduler and Filtered Scheduler. In both cases, the instance failed to spawn (with the above described error issue), but on a less available resource node (less free CPU, RAM and Disk) - the node was chosen by the scheduler. But the instance was launch successfully but manually, on another node with more free resources.",
