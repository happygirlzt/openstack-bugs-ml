They just see a nic.\n| They can't possibly use that information in any way, so telling them is\n| not helpful.  The type of the device should be 'tap' or 'ethernet'.\n| \n| Can you submit a merge proposal upstream that does that?\n| \n| We can take these things in, but they're silly and quite obviously busted,\n| unless you have some information that shows why they're not.\n\nI'm willing to take this, but lets *please* work to fix the source\nof the problem.\n\nAdrian,\nCan you please file a merge proposal upstream to fix this?\n\nYou're welcome to use this bug.

That change contains fixes for other bugs that we need to get into -updates.\n\nI've made requests off-bug to both Xiang Hui and to Adrian Vladu, but have not gotten a response.\n\nAdrian has ACKed the upstream merge proposal at [1] with this fix.\n\nWhile the code change does change behavior, the chance for regression is very low.  See the code that was changed in context at [2].  Basically we extended the list of \"physical types\" to add 'hw_veb', 'hyperv', 'vhostuser'.  Previously, if that condition did not match, then we would raise a ValueError exception that is not handled, leaving the system basically un-usable.  Now, the strings are considered valid as \"physical\" and cloud-init will configure the devices as needed.\n\nSo:\n  Before: cloud-init raise exception and no user-data or metadata is used... user cannot log into system.\n  After: cloud-init configures networking and user-data and metadata is used.\n\nWorst case for regression is really \"still doesn't work\".\n\n--\n[1] https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/311548\n[2] https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/tree/cloudinit/sources/helpers/openstack.py#n599\n",
