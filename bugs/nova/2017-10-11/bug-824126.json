In Openstack EC2 API you can do this by specifying --placement group parameter with the syntax <zone>:<host> and is recognized only if you are using simpleScheduler. I want to do the same in OS API. Also I will modify nova-manage ServiceCommands class to expose additional zone information along with the service.",
