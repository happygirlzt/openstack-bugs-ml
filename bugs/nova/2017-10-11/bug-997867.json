    "description": "There is a sync problem  where every now and then the snapshot action will leave the snapshotted instance in permanent \u201cShutoff\u201d Status. But checking the hypervisor shows that the instance is actually in \u201cRunning\u201d Status.\n \nIt seems that the instance will go into shutoff state to perform the snapshot operation which is normal. However if the snapshot is performed at the wrong moment, the snapshot action will cause the instance status in the DB to go out of sync with the instance status of the hypervisor.\n \nNova will eventually correct the Power State to \u201cRunning\u201d but the Status will never be corrected and stay in \u201cShutoff\u201d indefinitely.\n \nTo reproduce the problem:\n \n-      Create a VM, find the compute node it is running on.\n-      Tail the nova-compute.log file and grep for \u2018_sync_power_state\u2019\nYou should get \u201c2012-05-10 04:07:11 DEBUG nova.manager [-] Skipping ComputeManager._sync_power_states, 1 ticks left until next run from (pid=1528) periodic_tasks /opt/stack/nova/nova/manager.py:147\u201d\n-      If you start a snapshot when you see the \"1 tick left\", it will cause the error.\n \nLooking at the code, the _sync_power_states will detect that the VM Status and Power State are Shutoff (because of the snapshot) and update the DB, but it seems that after the snapshot is completed there is no mechanism to update the Status.\nIf the _sync_power_states is run again it will only update the  Power State for Shutoff to Running, but the Status will remain in Shutoff\n\nThe only workaround is to Reboot the instance.\n\nThis is happening on the Essex 2012-2-dev (LOCALBRANCH) with hypervisor KVM/QEMU",
