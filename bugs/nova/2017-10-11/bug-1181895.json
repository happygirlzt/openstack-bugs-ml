Because nova-compute is\n    a single thread, it won't process any other work at the same time.\n    Here give other threads chance to run by using time.sleep(0), that\n    acts as a yield of the thread for eventlet.\n    \n    Fixes bug #1181895\n    \n    Change-Id: I79fbd9d7d4fb7791ca599b136cf9945dec8996e2\n",
