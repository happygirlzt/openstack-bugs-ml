This patch adds this to the powervm\n    driver and allows execution to continue until the instance is in a\n    'Running' state instead of failing out.\n    \n    This patch fixes Bug #1084641\n    \n    blueprint powervm-compute-enhancements\n    \n    Change-Id: Ieb17b215547e77ee8d13b18496ba4090fc45757b\n",
