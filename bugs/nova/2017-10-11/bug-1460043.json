For example\n    an administrator can add or remove CPUs based on the current\n    resource consumption.\n    \n    As a result, the number of CPUs should not be cached within\n    the nova service, but it needs to be retrieved again when\n    updating resource allocation to report it to the controller\n    node.\n    \n    Change-Id: I2382a22c7aa492071647fa6dca42b54d1baf050d\n    Closes-bug: #1460043\n",
