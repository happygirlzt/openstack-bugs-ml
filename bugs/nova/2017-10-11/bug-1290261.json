This ensures that\n    all log messages, except debug ones, have translations.\n    \n    A '# noqa' indicates that the validation will not be done on\n    the specific log message. This should be used in cases where\n    the translations do not need to be done, for example, the log\n    message is logging raw data.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1290261\n    Change-Id: Ib2ca0bfaaf432e15448c96619682c2cfd073fbbc\n",
