Source host vcpu_pin_set is larger than the destination host vcpu_pin_set:\n\n    http://paste.openstack.org/show/473274/ \n\n2. Source host vcpu_pin_set is the same size as the destination host vcpu_pin_set, but with completely different values:\n\n    http://paste.openstack.org/show/473286/\n\nConclusion: The live migration completed successfully in both cases, and it looks to me like the cpuset attribute was updated correctly to match the destination host policy, but perhaps I've misunderstood & failed to simulate a case that would trigger a migration failure or policy conflict.\n\nThoughts?\n\n[1] I'm new to OpenStack.",

As stated from the bug - I reported this based only on reading the code.\n\nI think we can move this to 'Invalid' - it'd be great to get the commit hash which you used to test this if possible.",
