    "description": "Right now, you declare periodic tasks with the @manager.periodic_task decorator..  It accepts a # of ticks to specify interval to run.\n\nThe issue I have is that changing FLAGS.periodic_interval will modify every periodic task.  It's also slightly annoying to have to compute # of seconds you'd like to run a task at... based on dividing it by the setting of periodic_interval to get # of ticks.\n\nRough ideas of what I'd like to do for Folsom:\n\nchange @manager.perodic_task() to allow keyword args of \"enabled\" and \"interval\".  interval is in seconds.  \"ticks\" goes away.\n\nModify the task runner to be a bit more smart.  Since it has a list of periodic tasks to run (and it can ignore ones that are enabled=False)..  it can figure out the amount of time it needs to sleep to run the next task.  Essentially the task runner can sit in a greenthread sleeping until the next periodic task should run based on its \"interval\" setting.\n\nSomething like that :)  Other ideas welcomed!",

There is\n    also a flag (run_external_periodic_tasks) which can be used to move\n    these periodic tasks out of the nova-compute process.\n    \n    I also remove the periodic_interval flag to services, as the interval\n    between runs is now dynamic based on the number of seconds that a\n    periodic task wants to wait for its next run. For callers who want to\n    twiddle the sleep period (for example unit tests), there is a\n    create() argument periodic_interval_max which lets the period\n    periodic_tasks() specifies be overridden. This is not exposed as a\n    flag because I cannot see a use case for that. It is needed for unit\n    testing however.\n    \n    DocImpact. Resolves bug 939087.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7f245a88b8d229a481c1b65a4c0f1e2769bf3901\n",
