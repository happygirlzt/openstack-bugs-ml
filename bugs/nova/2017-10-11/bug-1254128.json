This has beem addressed by\n    making the driver _poll_task return the task information.\n    \n    The patch set also solves the following bugs by checking if\n    the FileAlreadyExistsException exception is raised. This could\n    be due to another process or thread creating the file.\n    \n    Closes-bug: 1230047\n    Closes-bug: 1254128\n    \n    Change-Id: I788e33dbcb3dedc41831b976137607274b1c02ca\n",
