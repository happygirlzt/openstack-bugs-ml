That fixed the case that we delete the VirtualInterface objects in the nova db when deallocating networks for an instance or a single port.\n\nBut if we fail to allocate networking from the start, we also do a cleanup on the ports we've created and/or updated, but we aren't deleting the VIFs we've created, here:\n\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/92a388a1e34559b2ce69d31fdef996ff029495a6/nova/network/neutronv2/api.py#L847\n\nThat also needs to happen because we could do something like:\n\n1. create/update port1, create vif1, ok\n2. create/update port2, fails - we deallocate port1 and port2 but not vif1",
