    "description": "Assuming direct DB access is in use (instead of using conductor), a nova service (thread) may be blocked for an extended period during DB access if (1) the service successfully established a DB connection and (2) the connection became broken (e.g., due to a network partition fault between the nova service and the DB backend) when the service was trying to issue a SQL statement to the DB backend. \n\nOur experiment showed that in such cases, the nova service (the thread issuing the DB statement) can be blocked for about 930 seconds. A timeout needs to be associated to such operations from OpenStack to achieve better control.",
