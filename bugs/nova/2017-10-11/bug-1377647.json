The first time is for the tenant and the second, if necessary,\n    is for the admin. This is in the event that a port binding extension\n    is supported (only an admin user can read this).\n    \n    In addition to this is a client exists then the method will make use\n    of it passing it to all internal methods called. This will enable them\n    to reuse that client instead of creating a new one.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia826199ea600ab55447ca4e8a78738c21b473efa\n    Closes-bug: #1377647\n",
