The original wsgi script in\n    nova/wsgi/nova-api.py did not, leading to the bug referenced below.\n    \n    The new wsgi script at nova.api.openstack.compute.wsgi, modelled on\n    a similar thing used for the placement API, provides the necessary\n    service registration.\n    \n    If a ServiceTooOld exception happens while trying to register the\n    service then a very simple (currently very stubby) application is\n    loaded instead of the compute api. This application returns a 500\n    and a message.\n    \n    Some caveats/todos:\n    \n    * wsgi apps managed under mod-wsgi (and presumably other containers)\n      are not imported/compiled/run until the first request is made. In\n      this case that means the service handling does not happen until\n      that first request, somewhat defeating the purpose if the api is a\n      bit idle.\n    \n    Change-Id: I7c4acfaa6c50ac0e4d6de69eb62ec5bbad72ff85\n    Closes-Bug: #1661360\n",
