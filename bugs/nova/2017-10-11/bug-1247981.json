So I can't really test it again but I haven't changed my nova.conf since then.\n\nI deployed all Openstack-Services inside a VM(Ubuntu Raring) of a XEN-Server.  I added \"deb http://ubuntu-cloud.archive.canonical.com/ubuntu precise-updates/grizzly main\" to my /etc/apt/souces.list and installed all packages(keystone, glance, nova, swift, ...) you need for a working environment and configured them. \nEverything worked fine but the colleges wanted the floating ips to be assigned automatic.\n\nI added my !working! nova.conf as an attachment.\nBefore it worked my floating-pool was just called \"nova\" (nonworking) and i changed it to \"public\" (working). I also changed the default_floating_pool line in nova.conf from \"nova\" (nonworking) to \"public\" (working).\n\nIf you need more information just say which kind of information. \n\n\n",
