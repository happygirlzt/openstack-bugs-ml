This adds policy\n    checking back in at the V3 API level so that the compute:update policy will\n    continue to function as it did before.\n    \n    This was fixed in I365ad8ac2845d914deefb841c314a50f4869dba0 for the V2\n    API.\n    \n    Change-Id: I9caa3e10fe029569c6fd467e7b86103dd6590f9b\n    Closes-Bug: 1242955\n",
