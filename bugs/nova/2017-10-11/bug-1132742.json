Berrange <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Feb 25 12:00:05 2013 +0000\n\n    Run libguestfs API calls in a thread pool\n    \n    The libguestfs API is a binding to a native C library, and thus\n    it will block greenthreads. To avoid this all libguestfs API\n    calls need to be run in a threadpool. This can be done by just\n    wrapping the GuestFS object in an eventlet.tpool.Proxy object\n    \n    Fixes bug #1132742\n    Change-Id: I877ad9e88442e41c9ad234503d9b1ddf1fb27408\n    Signed-off-by: Daniel P.
