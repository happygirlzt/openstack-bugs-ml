This is especially\n    likely to occur in lab setups.\n    \n    This change alters the above format to the following, which uniquely\n    identifies a cluster globally:\n    \n      <mo_id>.<vCenter uuid>\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1329261\n    Co-Authored-By: Kanagaraj Manickam <email address hidden>\n    Change-Id: I2f3b5d224cc653d0465598de0788116e71d1ca0d\n",
