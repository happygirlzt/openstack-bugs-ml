In the 204 case\n    we won't have response text, so we should handle that before trying\n    to load the json repsonse text. Because TypeError and ValueError are\n    handled it would just result in a warning if you got a 204, unless\n    CONF.api.vendordata_dynamic_failure_fatal was True in which case\n    it's a failure (as shown in the unit test update here).\n    \n    Change-Id: Iba95fd0112ae4510ef21fdb44fcb281b14567c07\n    Closes-Bug: #1669084\n",
