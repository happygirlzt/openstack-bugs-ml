            "content": "This is a solution for sharding the tokens. That's something completely different from HA.\n\nBy setting up two memcache servers, you have 2 SPOFs - one is each of the memcache servers (because tokens are not shared between them), another one is the consoleauth (if that server goes down, you can't access any server). If you setup another consoleauth server, you're just ending up with 1 SPOF again (token stored in one memcache).\n\nThis bug is about removing that SPOF - make sure that the information itself is replicated in case of multiple servers. There are also reasons not to rely on external memcache (as mentioned in the bug title).",
