Unfortunately, ovs does not reinitialize the interfaces as they\nare already in ovsdb and does not assign them a ofport number.\n\nThis situation corrects itself though the next time a port is added to the\novs-bridge which is why no one has probably noticed this issue till now.\n\nIn order to correct this we should first remove interface that exist and\nthen readd them.\n\nsame bug on neutron-side:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1268762",
