For example, if I resize a server with flavor 1 and I resize to flavor 2, but then decide to revert, after returning to the ACTIVE status, a GET request for that server may return the incorrect flavor for 1-10 seconds afterwards.\n\nOne of the Tempest tests (test_resize_server_revert in test_server_actions.py) can reproduce this issue.",
