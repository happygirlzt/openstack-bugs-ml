    "description": "When an rpc exception happens it used to show a useless traceback in the log: http://logs.openstack.org/22610/2/gate/gate-tempest-devstack-vm-full/6278/logs/screen-n-cpu.txt.gz\n\nThis other bug removed the traceback:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1137994\n\n----\n\nSome openstack installation administrators would like to have a useful traceback when rpc calls fail in order to debug the installation.\n\nHowever as bug #1137994 notes; some rpc calls are expected to fail and would just generate noise in the logs if they logged these tracebacks.\n\n----\n\nWe propose having optional tracebacks, and that the traceback's have useful information in them.\n\nThe option will most likely come from a parameter to the rpc call method, or an extra special attribute in the message; eg {'_disable_exception_logging': True}.\n\nThe default would be on, however for those methods that expect a failure, they would be disable logging of exceptions and log what they need themselves. That way the caller can decide if they want logging.\n\nThe traceback logged will show the methods that led down to the call being initiated, and the rpc topic (if available) and the method called.\n\n----\n\nFixing in oslo-incubator: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/23508/",
