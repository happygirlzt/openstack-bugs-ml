Makes the specific file path/content limit exceeded exceptions\n       extend the more generic OnsetFileLimitExceeded exception.\n    \n    2. Adds the OverQuota checking to the rebuild APIs with tests.\n    \n    3. Adds unit tests for the three different exceptions raised from\n       _check_injected_file_quota in the compute API since those did not\n       exist before.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1358380\n    \n    Change-Id: I9c72dea6075fcf554abb8e669cf4dd3129176912\n",
