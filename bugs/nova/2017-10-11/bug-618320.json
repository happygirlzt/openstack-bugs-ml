(The same is actually true for autoconf or cmake or whathaveyou...\nsoftware build/install doesn't handle deps properly, which is why we\nhave package management in the first place)\n\nNow, I do _not_ know a good solution for this on OSX other that writing\nscripts or requiring use of one of the OSX add-on package managers. But\nfor the forseeable future I'd argue that trying to get a magical\none-step dev env launcher in the tree that handles all of the possible\nclient oses is a pipe-dream and a waste of time, because it's\nessentially an attempt at creating a simple cross-platform package\nmanagement system. :) I think for some of it part of the instructions\nare just going to have to be \"install this software first\"\n\nJust my opinion of course...\n\n\nConfidentiality Notice: This e-mail message (including any attached or\nembedded documents) is intended for the exclusive and confidential use of the\nindividual or entity to which this message is addressed, and unless otherwise\nexpressly indicated, is confidential and privileged information of Rackspace.\nAny dissemination, distribution or copying of the enclosed material is prohibited.\nIf you receive this transmission in error, please notify us immediately by e-mail\nat <email address hidden>, and delete the original message.\nYour cooperation is appreciated.\n",
