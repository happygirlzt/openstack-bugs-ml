So this is a reasonable request, I am just not sure that it should be a bug.\n\nhttps://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Blueprints\n",

The policy is using RULE_ADMIN_API [1] but I think maybe it doesn't work because the path for both \"limits\" and \"used limits\" is \"/limits\".\n\nBut maybe this has been exposed so long that quota-sets should be changed to have parity.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/48268c7/nova/policies/used_limits.py#L27",

Otherwise, it's allowed to get usage for its own project. So indeed it doesn't look like a bug on the used limits side.\n\nIt was probably similar confusion that made the quota-sets side admin-only.\n\n[1] https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/48268c7/nova/api/openstack/compute/used_limits.py#L71",
