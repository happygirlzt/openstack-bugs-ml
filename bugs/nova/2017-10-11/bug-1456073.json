Or can we? \n - can we have same Floating IP on two nodes at the same time and what are side effects? \n - if we can will it (how will it) help to not loose ssh connection during live migration?\n - if we can't what is the right moment for floating ip transition? \n - if we have a notification from nova to neutron at the right moment (when VM is actually \"migrating\" to the destination) will it still be enough to preserve ssh connection? (in this case neutron server should notify l3 agent and agent needs to process the router, which currently means going back to server for router info)",

In order for this to be there, we have to track the port with respect to the \"old_host\",  \"cur_host\" and \"new_host\" or \"future_host\".\n   For this I would suggest that we make changes to the port-binding table to handle all \"host\"    changes.\n  In this case the old_host and the cur_host can be the same. The new_host denotes where the port is intended to move. Once we get this information, the server can pre-populate the details and send it to the agent to create the fip namespace.\n  In order to address this I have already created a patch.\n  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/259299/\n\n3. The thing that we need more should we need to have a different type of \"event_notifier\" such as \"MIGRATE_START\" or \"MIGRATE_END\" for the port, or else are we going to make use of the same \"UPDATE_PORT\", \"BEFORE_UPDATE\" for this. -- This should be considered.\n\n4. With all this infrastructure, when \"NOVA\" provides us a notification before \"pre-migration\" to setup the L3, then we can go ahead and create it. \n\n5. If there are any other issues on the neutron side, we can notify 'NOVA\" that network-is-not-ready for migration and NOVA should take necessary action.\n\n6. If everything is fine, we send a \"OK\" message, and NOVA will proceed with the migration.\n\n7. If NOVA errors out, it should send a reply back to us and about its state and we should revert the state on our side.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n     ",

But in the case of instance live\n    migration, the creation of l3 routed networks on the\n    destination node is delayed since we react to the event.\n    \n    This patch tries to proactively create routers on the\n    destination node based on the portbinding profile info\n    updated by the nova when the instance is on a pre-migration\n    state.\n    \n    Nova calls setup_network_on_host during the pre-migration\n    phase and we update the portbinding profile dict with\n    an attribute 'migrating_to' as shown below\n    \n    port:{'binding:profile':{'migrating_to': 'host'}}\n    \n    where 'host' points to the 'destination' of the port.\n    \n    L3 plugin will verify the migration profile for the port on\n    any port update and then take action to create routers in the\n    respective agents if routers have not been created.\n    \n    If the live migration fails or if reverted, then the port\n    binding profile attribute 'migrating_to' will be cleared from\n    the port profile. In this case, the router and the fip namespace\n    may be created on the destination node, but since the VM did\n    not land on the destination node, it would not cause any issues,\n    since the traffic will still be flowing out from the origination\n    node, except for the existence of the router and fip namespace.\n    \n    For some reason if the creation of the router namespace and fip\n    namespace fails, then the live migration may still proceed as\n    it is now and the agent will create the router namespace and fip\n    namespace reactively.\n    \n    The case were we report status back to Nova and Nova reacting\n    to the setup_networks_on_host status will be handled in the\n    upcoming release.\n    \n    This patch should not affect any upgrades with respect to the\n    agent or server.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibb62f012333cfdfd468bafdc0b4501aa46b4b54d\n    Related-Bug: #1456073\n",

This will\n    be addressed in a different patch, since we don't have such\n    wait state in nova at this time.\n    \n    The neutron side changes are handled in different patch sets shown\n    below [1] server side and [2] agent side.\n    \n    [1] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/275420/\n    [2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/260738/\n    \n    NOTE: Older versions of neutron may ignore the new port binding\n    migrating profile information.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ib1cc44bf9d01baf4d1f1d26c2a368a5ca7c6ab68\n    Partial-Bug: #1456073\n",
