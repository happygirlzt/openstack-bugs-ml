    "description": "Both the /servers and /servers/details APIs support pagination. When the request includes the \"limit\" parameters, then a \"next\" link is included in the reply if the number of servers that match the query is greater than or equal to the limit.\n\nThe problem occurs when the caller does not include the limit parameter but the total number of servers is greater than or equal to the default \"CONF.osapi_max_limit\". When this occurs, the number of servers in the reply is \"osapi_max\" but there is no \"next\" link. Therefore, the caller cannot determine if there are any more servers and has no marker value such that they can retrieve the rest of the servers.\n\nThe fix for this is to include the \"next\" link when the total number of servers is greater than or equal to the default limit, even if the \"limit\" parameter is not supplied.\n\nThe documentation also says that the \"next\" link is required:  http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-compute/2/content/Paginated_Collections-d1e664.html\n\nThe fix appears to be in the _get_collection_links function in nova/api/openstack/common.py. The logic needs to be updated so that the \"next\"\nlink is included if the total number of items returned equals the minimum of either the \"limit\" paramater or the \"CONF.osapi_max_limit\" value.",
