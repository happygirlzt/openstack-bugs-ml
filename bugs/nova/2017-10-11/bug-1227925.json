To address\n    this _update_resource_tracker is now called from solely the\n    _complete_deletion method. That method is called both by the\n    _init_instance and _delete_instance code paths, both of which should\n    be doing cleanup in the resource tracker when the vm is DELETED.\n    \n    Note that this change does mean that if _delete_instance has an\n    exception, _update_resource_tracker will not be called. This is\n    considered okay because we cannot guarantee at which stage the\n    exception happened and the state of the resources involved. For safety\n    it is better to err on the side of \"in use\".\n    \n    Change-Id: I586c0305ea0e20d98697bc9173ca0f89dc2b228c\n    Related-Bug: #1227925\n",
