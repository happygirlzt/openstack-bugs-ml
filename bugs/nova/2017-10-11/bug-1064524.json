    "description": "When Quantum is enabled the API driver (nova.network.quantumv2.api.Api) executes allocate_for_instance for creating Quantum ports and building the network_info data structure which is then reused throughout the spawn process.\n\nPorts are created in the order specified by _get_available_networks, which at the moment could either be all the networks accessible to the tenant, or the just the networks he/she requested using the --nic options (ie: the multinic extension, if I'm not wrong).\nHowever, the network_info data structure is then built invoking _build_network_info_model, which invokes a GET /ports on quantum. This function builds the data structure in the same order as the ports returned by the Quantum server, rather than the order specified by _get_available_networks.\nAs there is no guarantee that the order of the ports returned by quantum is the same as the order specified by _get_available_networks, it is possible that Nics are then attached to the VM in an order different from the one expected to the user, and there is also a chance this order might be different for different VMs using the same networks.\n\nPlease note that this bug is not a duplicate of bug 1042348, although they are somewhat related.\n\nA simple fix could consist in building network_info using the order specified by _get_available_networks",
