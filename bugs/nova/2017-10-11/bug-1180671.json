The reason is that the order in which the Mox and Stubs\n    are unset may not necessarily match-up with the order in which the tests\n    called them. For example:\n    \n    Suppose we have a test that Stubs a method in its `setUp` and then Mox's that\n    same method in the test body:\n    \n        Stub: Original-Func -> Stubbed-Func\n        Mox: Stubbed-Func -> Mocked-Func\n    \n    Now when `TestCase` ultimately does its `cleanUp`, it will UnStub before\n    UnMocking:\n    \n        UnStub: Stubbed-Func -> Original-Func\n        UnMox: Mocked-Func -> Stubbed-Func\n    \n    Notice that generic cleanup has mistakingly left `Stubbed-Func` in place.\n    \n    Given that Stubs and Mox can be performed in any order, the upshot here is\n    that the generic cleanup can't always be relied on.\n    \n    The proposed solution has two parts: a best-practice change and a small\n    code-change.\n    \n    The code-change is to reverse the current order to UnMox before UnStubbing.\n    While in theory the order is arbitrary, in practice, we have lots of Stubs in\n    `setUp` methods already, so UnMox'ing first makes sense (and it fixes a\n    current bug to boot!)\n    \n    The best-practice change is to recommend against stubbing and mocking the same\n    function as well as to always place stubs before mocks when relying on the\n    generic cleanup. If a developers needs to deviate from this, cleanup of stubs\n    created after mocks are their responsibility.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1180671\n    \n    Change-Id: I42ab8b55026c0a133625a7cc81ed8b960e9d47d7\n",
