The tests using a 4byte wide utf-8 character are left\n    as xfails because not all installations of mysql will support it.\n    \n    Also confirm that if a unicode characters (uri-encoded or not) in\n    the uuid part of a resource providers path will result in the\n    expected 404 and not explode.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1621605\n    Change-Id: I3d906c3296aa28b595fcc23c448c1744972c319d\n",
