PciServerController shows PCI information for a given server, so that's an extension of the /servers API. That puts the os-pci:pci_devices key in the server response body.\n\n2. PciHypervisorController shows PCI devices on a given compute node, so that's an extension of the /os-hypervisors API. That puts the os-pci:pci_stats key in the os-hypervisors response body.\n\n3. PciController is for listing all PCI devices and showing details about a specific PCI device. When listing PCI devices in this API, we query all compute nodes, and then for each compute node we get the PCI devices and dump those into a list of dicts where the keys are whitelisted and based on whether or not we're listing PCI devices with details or not.",

The original intent was to enable\n    it in a microversion but that never happened.\n    \n    We should just delete this API since it has a number of issues\n    anyway:\n    \n    1. It's not documented (which makes sense since it's not enabled).\n    2. The PciHypervisorController just takes the compute_nodes.pci_stats\n       dict and dumps it to json out of the REST API with no control over\n       the keys in the response. That means if we ever change the fields\n       in the PciDevicePool object, we implicitly introduce a backward\n       incompatible change in the REST API.\n    3. We don't want to be reporting host stats out of the API [1].\n    4. To make the os-hypervisors extension work in a multi-cell environment\n       we'd have to add uuids to the PciDevices model and change the API to\n       return and take in uuids to identify the devices for GET requests.\n    5. And last but not least, no one has asked for this in over two years.\n    \n    As a result of removing this API we can also remove the join on the\n    pci_devices table when showing details about an instance or listing\n    instances, which were added years ago because of the PciServerController:\n    \n    Id3c8a0b187e399ce2acecd4aaa37ac95e731d46c\n    \n    Id3e60c3c56c2eb4209e8aca8a2c26881ca86b435\n    \n    [1] https://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/policies.html?#metrics-gathering\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1426241\n    Closes-Bug: #1673869\n    \n    Change-Id: I9099744264eeec175672d10d04da69648dec1a9d\n",
