That\n    doesn't play nice with horizon, and requires the caller to know\n    what the image expects.\n    \n    Currently, only None or 'always' are documented (although any\n    value is treated as 'always').  I expect we'll want 'never',\n    'byimage' etc in future.\n    \n    Bug #988556\n    \n    Change-Id: I895a6a9fd3e6395bb00f54f26531b6faf0c9f4f1\n",
