I should be able to add custom fields somewhere without having to define a brand new filter. The scheduler is already configured to receive these capabilities, the flavor is set up to restrict these capabilities, but compute nodes have no mechanism today to advertise these custom extra specs.\n\nPlease reopen and reconsider or offer a workaround.",
