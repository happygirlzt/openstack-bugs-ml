This would result in the `message` attribute\n    always being 'type' and the first-line of details being useless.\n    \n    The solution is to pass the actual exception object so that `message`\n    becomes the class-name and the first-line of details becomes the `repr`\n    of the exception object.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1100559\n    \n    Change-Id: Ibaeb5dc5af419de6c98b44aec07bff225b2f9956\n",
