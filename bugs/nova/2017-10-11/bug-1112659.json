This change\n    checks for the existence of a dhcp server and, if found, does not\n    inject static settings for that network.\n    \n    Due to limitations of the legacy network info, the fix only\n    applies when new-style network info is passed to the injection\n    template function.  The only code still passing in legacy\n    network info is in libvirt, and there is work ongoing to\n    remove that dependency.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1163985\n    Fixes bug 1112659\n    \n    Change-Id: I8d3f16bde22e1c6dc0d2432aa263e2b15ae5c93a\n",
