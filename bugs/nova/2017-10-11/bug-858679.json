There's no exception thrown\n2) The call to db.instance_set_state should not be there.  It's defined in db/api.py but is not in sqlalchemy/api.py\n3) It returns None... but callers expect it to always succeed.\n\nI think the solution is:\n\n1) Change LOG.exception to a LOG.error\n2) raise an exception instead of setting state and returning.\n3) Remove instance_set_state from db/api.py\n \n_create_vm() ends up being called from spawn() and finish_migration().  May want to look for callers of those in the compute manager and elsewhere to see that exceptions are caught properly and vm_state is set appropriately to vm_states.ERROR.  There may be a separate bug filed for this, however, that aaron lee is working on.",
