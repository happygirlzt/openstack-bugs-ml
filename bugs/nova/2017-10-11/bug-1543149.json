In the\n    current state of that feature we can't guarantee the necessary amount\n    of pages to allow OVS-DPDK to run properly on the compute node, which\n    result in the instance failing to boot on a well selected\n    compute-node. OVS-DPDK needs 1 GB hugepages reserved. Since Nova does\n    not take into account that page reserved for OVS-DPDK it results in\n    the process not being able to acquire the necessary memory which\n    results in a failed boot.\n    \n    This commit adds a new option 'reserved_huge_pages' which takes a list\n    of string format to select on which host NUMA nodes and from which\n    pagesize we want to reserve a certain amount of pages. It also updates\n    NUMAPageTopology to contain a reserved memory pages attribute, which\n    helps compute the available pages size on host for scheduling/claiming\n    resources.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ie04d6362a4e99dcb2504698fc831a366ba746b44\n    Closes-Bug: #1543149\n",

            "content": "I have issues with the fix.\n\nFirstly, and perhaps the most problematic point: it assumes the non-OpenStack consumption of pages ('reserved' pages, though they're not 'reserved' in the same sense as normal memory is 'reserved') is static.  There's no reason to believe that's true.  This isn't like the reserved memory in normal memory allocation, remember; that tracks system available memory as well, and this doesn't track available hugepages.  In this instance it's quite possible to have other processes consuming hugepages over time, and it's also possible to configure the kernel to break up hugepages if necessary, so it's a lot more like normal memory than a countable resource such as number of cores or PCI devices.\n\nSecondly, why calculate total-reserved in the scheduler and not on the compute host?  The scheduler needs to know free pages, it doesn't need to know all the information returned.  If it was told *only* the number of free pages I think we'd have more flexibility to improve the scheduler code and the compute node, and improve them independently, so it's more future proof.  Telling it the number of reserved pages can't help it.\n\nAside from that, the total number of hugepages is not fixed, as the pre-patch version of the code assumes.  It can be changed after initial deployment, but for some reason has been treated as a fixed feature of the system like the number of cores, sockets or CPU flags.  Not a criticism of this bug but another flag pointing that a rethink might be in order.\n",
