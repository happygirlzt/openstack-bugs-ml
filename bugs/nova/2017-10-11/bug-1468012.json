The lone in-tree plugin is a monitor that inherits from\n    nova.compute.monitors.base.CPUMonitorBase and uses the call to the\n    hypervisor's get_host_cpu_stats() to grab CPU-centric metrics on a\n    periodic basis.\n    \n    Change-Id: I3f2e8eca6ce43b07b3c8b430b8576be4f0d3f909\n    Partial-bug: 1468012\n",

This patch uses the stevedore library to load monitor\n    extensions. We keep the same semantics as the previous loading\n    mechanism: we use the CONF.compute_monitors configuration option to\n    winnow the set of all monitor plugins, and we ensure that no two\n    monitors that return the same set of metrics will be loaded.\n    \n    However, this patch deprecates the CONF.compute_available_monitors\n    configuration option, since stevedore and setuptools entry points now\n    allow a set of plugins to be specified without any further configuration\n    options.\n    \n    Change-Id: I97bf8bcd43faf9f3fe40983497c2360233d5f599\n    Fixes-bug: 1468012\n    DocImpact: deprecates the CONF.compute_available_monitors option.\n",
