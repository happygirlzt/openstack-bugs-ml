Note that there is further refactoring\n    possible but I wanted to keep the changes small to minimize chance for\n    regression. Also, no need to check for not found since we will have\n    errored much earlier if the flavor doesn't exist.\n    \n    This change is necessary to create a failing test for bug 1046040\n    \n    Change-Id: I718203b33a192575288057dd4631a9aa3086b567\n",
