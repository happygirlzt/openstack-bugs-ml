Adding a dnsmasq_config_file option to the FLAGS definition allows this to be easily extended while not affecting the original functionality if the flag is not defined.\n\nThe option to tune dnsmasq is useful in many situations, such as defining domain= to set the domain for multiple subnets/projects, or to setup DNS delegation and fine tune upstream resolvers.",

If you have time it would be great to propose your branch for review.  I would in advance make a few suggestions:\n * Default the flag to None\n * Use an if block and only pass the flag if it is set\n\nAlso a question: will the conf file override the other command line arguments that are passed in?  If not, it may be better to actually move all of the command line arguments into a template file, and instantiate the template for each version of dnsmasq.  A user could specify different configurations using the template file.",
