It is easy to spot\n    patterns in the errors by looking at similarities in the exceptions\n    raised.\n    \n    This change looks at making the in-line error notifications\n    follow the same format, so they become equally useful.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1251602\n    Change-Id: I1cd64a90ecefc64d12af05487eb6e45aa0362d69\n",
