To generate the failure configure Nova for LVM ephemeral storage with\n\n[libvirt]\nimages_volume_group = nova-lvm\nimages_type = lvm\n\nMake the nova-lvm volume relatively small, say 5G, and boot an m1.small instance.\n\nException back trace is as follows: http://pastebin.com/ePG3s58P.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt is not entirely clear why the booting process is allowed to get as far as actually attempting to create instance disk since the scheduler really should return 0 matching hosts, as the disk is obviously too small.  However, once create_lvm_image() raises \"RunTimeError: Insufficient Space on Volume Group nova-lvm. ...\", the booting process attempts to recover gracefully by terminating the instance. At some point in the termination the (non-existent) instance volume is cleared, resulting in an execution of 'nova-rootwrap /etc/nova/rootwrap.conf blockdev --getsize64 /' , which does not match any of the root-wrap filters and generates ProcessExecutionError.",
