    "description": "The Nova services API extentsion which we added in Grizzly is internally inconsistent and also doesn't quite match what we are doing in novaclient either.\n\nNovaclient sends a request that looks like this:\n\nREQ: curl -i http://localhost:8774/v1.1/99d907eceb0846b4b07d56458063fc7f/os-services/disable -X PUT -H \"X-Auth-Project-Id: admin\" -H \"User-Agent: python-novaclient\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Auth-Token: 171ca63833e5489486608448406c07f8\" -d '{\"binary\": \"nova-cert\", \"host\": \"nova1\"}'\n\nBut our services extension currently expects the {\"service\": \"nova-cert\", \"host\": \"nova1\"} format.\n\nI actually think novaclient is correct in this regard because our index format for os-services uses 'binary' as well. For example:\n\n[root@nova1 v1_1]# nova service-list\n+----------------+-------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+\n| Binary         | Host  | Zone     | Status  | State | Updated_at                 |\n+----------------+-------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+\n| nova-cert      | nova1 | internal | enabled | up    | 2013-03-05T21:14:39.000000 |\n| nova-compute   | nova1 | nova     | enabled | up    | 2013-03-05T21:14:38.000000 |\n| nova-network   | nova1 | internal | enabled | up    | 2013-03-05T21:14:44.000000 |\n| nova-scheduler | nova1 | internal | enabled | up    | 2013-03-05T21:14:41.000000 |\n+----------------+-------+----------+---------+-------+----------------------------+\n\nSo I think the thing to do is make the os-service update format consistent with what the index format uses (and returns) and then novaclient should work as well.",
