Any subnet that contains less than 4 IP addresses yields an empty list\n\nFor most users, this isn't a problem because usually IP addresses are over-provisioned, but it can lead to a very annoying bug where 'nova-manage floating create 192.168.0.2' works, but 'nova-manage floating create 192.168.0.2/32' and 'nova-manage floating create 192.168.0.2/31' both fail to affect nova's floating_ips table at all.",
