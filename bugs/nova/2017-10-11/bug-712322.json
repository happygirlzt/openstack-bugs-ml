    "description": "In IPv6 testing issue is been identified. To reproduce the bug follow below steps :-\n1) Create a security group without security rule and using the same run an instance.\n2) Try to ssh created instance <It will fail due to no permission>\n3)Authorize security group with security rule of  >> tcp, 22,\n4) Again ssh instance <Successful>\n5)Revoke security group with security rule of >> tcp, 22.\n6) Again ssh instance <successful> which is a wrong behaviour . \n\nAbove steps can be performed for multiple instances of multiple projects and even in multiple compute nodes. After once SSH is done, From instance's security group revoke the security rule and try it again, still SSH will happen and that can be checked from instances\\server as well.\n\nThis bug is been tested on  nova revision number >> 645 & 639",
