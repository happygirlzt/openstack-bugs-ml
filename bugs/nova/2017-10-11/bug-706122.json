We could probably eliminate the krm_mapping and instead have the machine image record in glance contain two properties like:\n\n{ 'kernel_id': 1, 'ramdisk_id': 2}\n\nIn the long run, though, I think we'll be using images with the kernel inside, so this could end up being moot.\n",

Feel free to comment here or on the mailing list!\n\nCheers!\njay",
