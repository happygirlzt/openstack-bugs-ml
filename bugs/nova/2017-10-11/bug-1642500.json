Currently, we proceed with\n    booting min(quota_value, max_count) number of instances and only\n    issue a debug message to Nova logs. It may be unclear to an operator,\n    why a fewer number of VMs were booted, and there will be nothing\n    useful in logs, if debug wasn't enabled.\n\n    Issue an info level log message instead, so that it's visible in\n    production logs without debug logging enabled (oslo.log now defaults\n    to verbose=True).\n\n    TrivialFix\n\n    Change-Id: I1e5edf17ce7d5a3bc2ac9403c7a8d492de274789\n",
