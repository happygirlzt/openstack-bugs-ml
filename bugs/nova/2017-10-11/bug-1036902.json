The most common case is a VM which has block storage attached via iSCSI, whereby the physical system is rebooted.  When the system comes back up and starts nova-compute, the iSCSI connections are NOT recreated for the instances slated to be resumed (assuming resume_guests_state_on_host_boot is set).\n\nNova properly updates a VM's libvirt XML to reference attached block devices, such as follows:\n\n<source dev='/dev/disk/by-path/ip-10.255.171.82:3260-iscsi-iqn.2010-10.org.openstack:volume-00000005-lun-1'/>\n\nHowever, any attempts to recover the instance (via hard_reboot or otherwise) will fail, as the /dev/disk location is invalid until the iSCSI connections are re-established.   In effect, there is no way for a user to recover a VM in this state unless iscsiadm/tgt is used to manually reconnect to all the targets.\n\nThis issue impacts both the latest Folsom and Essex branches.  I'll be submitting patches to fix both versions.",
