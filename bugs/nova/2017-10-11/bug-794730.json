However I think that for flavors and servers api Ithat the behavior is still to use limit=0 as max_limit.  These should one day be consistent?\n\nAt the very least we should change the comments in http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/common.py#n206 to represent the new behavior.",
