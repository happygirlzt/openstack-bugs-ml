            "content": "So some comments regarding 1/\n\n* I am not sure if we want to make NUMA topology (even if single cell) exposed to every instance without a way to turn it off. There may be guest OS concerns around that for the libvirt case.\n* The NUMA information makes no sense at this point for other drivers, some of which may never implement it.\n\nBased on that it seems to me that a cleaner approach is to keep the NUMA qualities of instances optional\n\n2/ Seems like a better approach to me - as for how to keep the smallest page size information in sync - two things come to mind: either don't report the smalles size at all, or make sure that resource tracker considers it and tracks it even for non-numa instances. I slightly prefer the first option",
