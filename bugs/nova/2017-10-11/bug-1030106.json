Disabled hosts can still have instances on them and are generally still running if they are not deleted, so they will (and should) run the task.   \n\nThis results in the log reporting things like \"100 of 95 hosts done. 0 errors\" on success, which may confuse automated systems using this for monitoring.",

Basically we were not counting disabled hosts\n    in the total host count. Also I have refactored the get_audit_task_logs\n    method, it's really part of the extension (only the extension uses it),\n    so I've moved it out of nova.compute.utils into the extension itself.\n    \n    (the tests that exercise it already lived in the extension's tests anyway.)\n    \n    Change-Id: Iaf42d887b824ba0cbf6ab0ed143a4c01b37b0cb1\n",
