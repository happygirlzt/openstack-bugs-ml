After negative test\n    which live migrate a KVM instance to Hyper-v host, there will be an exception\n    InvalidHypervisorType. As a result, the instance task_state is being\n    left as migrating. That leaves the instance in a broken state and most of the\n    requests on the instance will fail.\n    \n    Actually, there are some other exceptions will cause this issue as well, such\n    as UnableToMigrateToSelf, DestinationHypervisorTooOld. All of them are thrown\n    from the driver of scheduler during live migration. But obviously, if the live\n    migration fails at the schedule stage, the task_state of the target instance\n    should be updated to None.\n    \n    Fixes Bug: 1153283\n    \n    Change-Id: Ide4b48653268c8dbe31de6964814830d2e82a5ba\n",
