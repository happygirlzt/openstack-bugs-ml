    "description": "I tried running Nova (Grizzly) w/ libvirt version 0.8 and noticed that no errors were logged about using an unsupported libvirt version.  It looks like init_host in nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py makes libvirt calls before checking version (libvirt.virEventRegisterDefaultImpl() as an example) and if these calls aren't supported by the libvirt version installed then an exception will be raised prior to the error being logged.",

This change moves the version check before the libvirt\n    calls are made.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ifaae18c6686d72fb79fc32081c4087084ae8bbb9\n    Fixes: bug #1190232\n",
