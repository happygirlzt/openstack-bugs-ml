            "content": "When introducing interim bridge for XenAPI, it introduced a interface which is used to connect the interim bridge and it has the name as vifxxxxx-x. In XenServer, it use vif<dom#>.<dev#> to represent VM's virtual interface. In the xenapi plugin of bandwidth, it use the pattern of \"vif*\" to filter out VM's interfaces. Due to the existing of vifxxxxx-x, it will get exception and parse the interface's name basing on \"vif<dom#>.<dev>\". So I think we can give two fixes:\n1. use another name for the interface connected to the interim bridge. e.g. change vifxxxxx-x to intxxxxx-x. At here int is the first 3 chars of 'interim bridge';\n2. give more restrict pattern to filter VM's vifs e.g. change from \"vif*\" to \"vif<dom#>.<dev#>\".\n",

In the xenapi plugin of bandwidth, it uses\n    the pattern of \"^vif*\" to filter out VM's interfaces. Due to the\n    existing of vifxxxxxxxx-xx, it will get exception when parsing the\n    interface's name basing on \"vif<dom#>.<dev>\".\n    So let's give more restrict pattern to filter VM's vifs e.g. change from\n    \"^vif*\" to \"^vif<dom#>.<dev#>\". May consider to use another interface\n    name for the interface on interim bridge; but need cover both name\n    patterns when delete interfaces to avoid upgrade issues which may make\n    things complicated.\n    \n    Change-Id: I36b96bbe2bb764f3d60cbeb43aa3dbd9a0a43f61\n    Closes-Bug: #1597551\n",
