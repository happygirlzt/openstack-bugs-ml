            "content": "Yes, that is what the getattr call does. The problem is that the default value of \"0.0.0.0\", for example, is already configured in this line (which is the right place to put configuration defaults)-\n\ncfg.StrOpt('ec2_listen',\n               default=\"0.0.0.0\",\n               help='The IP address on which the EC2 API will listen.')\n\nHaving the default value at two places (getattr and StrOpt) has the same problems as any other code duplication. An example problem is that using the default value in getattr for CONF is that an attempt to read an incorrect CONF key (lets say \"ec_listen\" instead of \"ec2_listen\") will NOT fail and will simply default. This makes it difficult to debug such scenarios.\n\n(However, you are right that this isn't necessarily inconsistency, its more of duplication, I'll update the title)",
