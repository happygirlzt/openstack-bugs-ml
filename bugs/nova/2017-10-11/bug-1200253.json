This should probably be the composition of two methods \"\"\"Get the datastore list.\"\"\" and \"\"\"choose the first local storage.\"\"\" in the least. At best,  there should be a separate vSphere query to pull only the first local storage so that extra data is not pulled across the wire.\n\nSee:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/vmwareapi/vm_util.py#L670",
