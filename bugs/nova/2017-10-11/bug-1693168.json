But we forgot to merge the if/else extension code[1] which caused 'server_groups' and 'server_group_members' never showed up in quota class set APIs (GET and PUT) response. \n\n.. 1 http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/nova/tree/nova/api/openstack/compute/quota_classes.py#n47\n\nThis issue did not get caught on tests as legacy_v2 code got removed before functional tests with all extensions were enabled. And somehow sample file with 'server_groups' and 'server_group_members' attributes in response got disappeared while changing the directory structure v3->v2.1>/compute etc.",
