In general, this requires dns to be configured, and for that dns to return addresses on the management network.  This is an annoying deployment requirement, and probably also a mis-use of instance.host.\n\nIt should be possible for the administrator to configure this parameter to maximize deployment flexibility.",

For xenserver, this will generally be the management ip of dom0.  For libvirt, this will be the management ip of the host.\n     * Fixes bug 918451\n     * Renames vncserver_host to vncserver_listen for slightly better usage clarity\n     * Updates docs\n    \n    Change-Id: I85c9850c57ffac3dfecaec4510eb808a6a2af79c\n",
