            "content": "I have managed to trigger this bug on a compute node.\n\nUnfortunately, I will have to use some conjecture when it comes to how the error occured. Nearest I can gather:\n\n 1. Compute node receieves a message to create a new instance.\n 2. Firewall rules are being created for the instance. Meanwhile...\n 3. Libvirtd crashes.\n 4. Nova-compute crashes.\n 5. Stale iptables lock file persists.\n\nI have not (yet) verified the above scenario.\n\nWhile the lock file persists nova-compute does not seem to process any messages from the messages queue. In fact the entire process seems wedged waiting on the lock file.\n\nSymptoms that lead me to investigate:\n\n 1. RabbitMQ queue for the compute node was non-zero\n 2. Nova-compute was not running.\n\nResolution:\n\n 1. Restart libvirtd\n 2. Restart nova-compute\n 3. Realise that nova-compute would not persist past running iptables for the first instance discovered. The log message is as follows:\n\n2011-11-11 10:27:47,800 DEBUG nova.utils [-] Attempting to grab file lock \"iptables\" for method \"_do_refresh_provider_fw_rules\"... from (pid=17684) inner /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nova/utils.py:680\n\n 4. Strace the nova-compute process and discover that nova-compute is looping while waiting for a lock to be released. A sample of the strace follows:\n\nstat(\"/var/lock/nova/compute.Dummy-1-17684\", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 99)             = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nepoll_wait(4, {}, 1023, 0)              = 0\nlink(\"/var/lock/nova/compute.Dummy-1-17684\", \"/var/lock/nova/nova-iptables.lock.lock\") = -1 EEXIST (File exists)\n\n 5. Stop nova-compute\n 6. Verify that nova-compute is not running\n 7. Remove the lock file\n 8. Start nova-compute\n 9. Verify that the service has started correctly.\n",
