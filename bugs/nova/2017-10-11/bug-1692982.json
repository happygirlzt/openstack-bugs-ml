There should be a path for this command to exit with a failure code unless an unmapped host is found. If one is found, it should be considered a success. \n\n\nProposal\n========\nAdd a --strict option (defaulting to false) to the nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts command. When this option is provided, the command will succeed with exit code 0 if any unmapped hosts are discovered. In any other case it will fail with exit code 1.",
