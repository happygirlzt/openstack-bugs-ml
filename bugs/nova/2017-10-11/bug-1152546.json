This\n    corrects that by sweeping all of the likely instance_type_% values and\n    converting \"None\" to NULL. Also, it adds a belated created_at stamp\n    to all of the items, which was missing in 153 as well.\n    \n    It also corrects the 153 migration to avoid polluting things in the\n    first place for systems that haven't rolled through that yet.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1152546\n    \n    Change-Id: I3585463ae15abfd534f2ff070e2974f3cb51d7e8\n",
