It should be able to manage vmware vswitch in some manner and we didn't find some code about vmware in Quantum(Neutron). Unfortunately it forced us to use grizzly+vmware with deprecated nova-network.\n\nThanks, Roman",

I understand that the compute node is a VM that is running on the ESX. By default only traffic with the VM's MAC address can get to and from the VM. Would it be possible that you please try the following (without your patch): enable promiscuous mode and spoofing on the port of the compute node.\nThanks\nGary\n",
