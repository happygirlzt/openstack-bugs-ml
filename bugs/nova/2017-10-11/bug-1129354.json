However, instance_update() can change the instance type ID.  The _instance_update() method in sqlalchemy/api.py only seems to pull and set instance['extra_specs'] for the OLD instance_type if instance_type_id is changing (as can happen with resize()).  I think we need to pull the extra specs at the end of this method if the instance_type_id changes.",
