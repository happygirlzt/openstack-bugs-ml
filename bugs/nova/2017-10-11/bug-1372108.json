This approach is brittle and does not handle non-English\n    locales.\n    \n    This change replaces the existing approach with the 'isLuks' command\n    to determine if the device uses LUKS. In addition, test cases are\n    added to provide better coverage of the attach_volume operation\n    for encrypted volumes.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: 1372108\n    \n    Change-Id: I99f905f8f5c7d46ecc826fa0da5d36f54f1107dc\n",
