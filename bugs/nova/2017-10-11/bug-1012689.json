This would potentially head of some rather cryptic compute bugs that can occur if you try to use an older libvirt version with Nova.\n\nI recently hit some issues with the virDomain.reset() call being used to reboot instances in Nova.\n\nThe min required version for resize seems to be 0.9.7... see following command from danpb:\n\n# eu-readelf -a /usr/lib64/libvirt.so | grep virDomainReset | grep LIBVIRT\n  599: 00000000000dc3f0    551 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT       12 virDomainReset@@LIBVIRT_0.9.7\n\nSo it appears 0.9.7 is now our new min required version.",
