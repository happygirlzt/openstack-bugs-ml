This is not fun but it's the only way we can still land\n    release notes until an appropriate fix is merged (in reno or nova).\n    \n    Again, this is a temporary patch and we consider reverting it once bug 1534613\n    is fixed.\n    \n    Change-Id: Iedb69c66632383e056840e3294a90cda651a8778\n    Related-Bug: #1534613\n",
