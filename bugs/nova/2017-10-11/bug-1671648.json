For testing I just forced it to fail by adding raise nova.exception.ComputeResourcesUnavailable('forced failure') during the instance spawn on the host.\n1. Make sure environment is set to retry failed deploys.\n2. Attempt to deploy VM and wait for it to fail.\n\nExpected result:\nFailed instance is rescheduled and attempted on another host.\n\nActual result:\nDeploy fails but is not rescheduled.\n\n\n\nI am just beginning to experiment with ocata build from early March. I found that when an instance fails to deploy and throws a RescheduledException, it is not getting rescheduled as expected. The problem appears to be that the filter_properties['retry'] is not getting set during initial deploy.\n\nOn initial deploy nova.conductor.manager.schedule_and_build_instances() schedules the build_request and creates the instance object. That method also creates the filter properties (filter_props) that is passed on to compute_rpcapi.build_and_run_instance(). The problem is that scheduler_utils.populate_retry() is not called before the filter_props is passed on to the build call. When the deploy later fails on the host nova.compute.manager._do_build_and_run_instance() catches the RescheduledException but does not try and reschedule it because filter_properties.get('retry') returns None.\n\nIn the past it looks like populate_retry() was called in by nova.conductor.manager.build_instances() during the initial deploy. I'm not seeing build_instances() get called during initial deploy after switching to ocata. As an experiment I added scheduler_utils.populate_retry(filter_props, build_request.instance_uuid) immediately after filter_props is set in schedule_and_build_instances(). Afterward I do see the instances get rescheduled. I also noticed nova.conductor.manager.build_instances() gets called for each attempt after the first.",
