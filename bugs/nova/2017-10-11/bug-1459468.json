If CONF.allow_resize_to_same_host = True, nothing will added to \nfilter_properties['ignore_hosts'], if it is set to False, the source host will be added to filter_properties['ignore_hosts'] and it \nwill be ignored when performing select_destinations.\n\nThe value of CONF.allow_resize_to_same_host has been checked again in compute/manager.py which is on the destination\nhost which has already been selected by scheduler.\n\nThis will lead to a problem, if CONF.allow_resize_to_same_host parameter is set to True in controller node but set to False\nor didn't set in compute node. When scheduler decided that the original compute node is the best one for resize but when\nthe compute node implementing the resize action, it will throw an exception.\n\nThe value of CONF.allow_resize_to_same_host should only check once in controller node (compute/api.py) and let scheduler\njudge which host is best for rebuild, the compute node should only perform the action when it has been selected.",
