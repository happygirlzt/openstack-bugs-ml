Migration and live block migration both succeed.\n\nResize fails, I believe, because 'qemu-img resize' is called (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L7218-L7221) before the backing image has been transferred from the source compute node (https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py#L7230-L7233).\n\nReplication requires two compute nodes. To replicate:\n\n1. Boot an instance from an image or snapshot.\n2. Delete the image from Glance.\n3. Resize the instance. It will fail with an error similar to:\n\nStderr: u\"qemu-img: Could not open '/var/lib/nova/instances/f77f1c5c-71f7-4645-afa1-dd30bacef874/disk': Could not open backing file: Could not open '/var/lib/nova/instances/_base/ca94b18d94077894f4ccbaafb1881a90225f1224': No such file or directory\\n\"",

But backing file is not copied in this\ncode flow, i would like to propose patch that fix this problem.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1.  Deploy openstack with 2 or more computes.\n2.  Boot one or more instances on the same compute with flavor micro or tiny.\n3. Resize one of the instances, that probably will cause migration.\n\nIf instance disk has backing file - migration will fail because in current implementation\nbacking files are not copied from one compute to another.",

Delete all instances, and then delete all backing images from the nova image cache on all compute nodes.\n2. Boot.\n3. Resize.\n\nEither way, you need to ensure that the destination hypervisor doesn't have the backing image in its cache. Deleting the image from Glance may also do this, eventually, since the Nova image cache manager purges cached images that are not in use and have been deleted from Glance, but just resizing the first instance booted from a new image is easier and more reliable.",

Sometimes it migrates to the same host it started on. What you're talking about here is a regular resize where the source and destination hosts are different, which is normal. When I read about a migration happening during a resize, I think about 2 separate user-initiated actions and a whole different class of bug.\n\nSecondly, there is code already in place which should be handling this, specifically finish_migration(). The interesting question is why that isn't working.",
