As we already remove the extension info API entry for extend-vif-net, so at least that won't break the user. \nAnd we decided we add those extend vif net atributes back with Microversions, and we already did that https://review.openstack.org/#/c/198944/ . So fix it in v2.1 isn't option, but we can fix it in v2.1 compat mode only.\n\n",
