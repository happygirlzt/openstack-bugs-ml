    "description": "When creating a cell using the nova-manage cell create command, the transport_url generated in the database is url-encoded (i.e. '=' is changed to '%3D', etc.)  That's propably the correct behavior, since the connection string is stored as URL.\n\nHowever, nova-cells doesn't properly decode that string.  So for transport_url credentials that contain url-encodable characters, nova-cells uses the url encoded string, rather than the actual correct credentials.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n- Create a cell using nova-manage with credentials containing url-encodable characters:\n\nnova-manage cell create  --name=cell_02 --cell_type=child --username='the=user' --password='the=password' --hostname='hostname' --port=5672 --virtual_host=/ --woffset=1 --wscale=1\n\n- nova.cells table now contains a url-encoded transport_url:\n\nmysql> select * from cells \\G\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\n   created_at: 2014-12-30 17:30:41\n   updated_at: NULL\n   deleted_at: NULL\n           id: 3\n      api_url: NULL\nweight_offset: 1\n weight_scale: 1\n         name: cell_02\n    is_parent: 0\n      deleted: 0\ntransport_url: rabbit://the%3Duser:the%3Dpassword@hostname:5672//\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n- nova-cells uses the literal credentials 'the%3Duser' and 'the%3Dpassword' to connect to RMQ, rather than the correct 'the=user' and 'the=password' credentials.",
