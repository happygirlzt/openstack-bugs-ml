Given the hypervisor support matrix doesn't list\n    the vmware driver as supporting the nova diagnostics API, it seems this\n    was just an oversight.\n    \n    This patch changes the driver code to call the vmops.get_diagnostics\n    method which raises NotImplementedError.  It also fixes the tests to\n    actually ensure covers get_diagnostics for both the ESX driver and the\n    VC driver.\n    \n    Closes-Bug: #1237622\n    \n    Change-Id: I0c9015f1f7d5dd219548196de479e87e878ea0fd\n",
