    "description": "Release from http://ppa.launchpad.net/nova-core/release/ubuntu natty main (ubuntu 11.04). x64 kvm, flatDHCP network mode\n\n If compute-node somehow halted - the instance running on it (may) remains in /var/lib/nova/instances  . While euca-describe-instance says this instance gone and in nova-compute.log when trying to terminate(euca-termintae) said \"Error: trying to destroy already destroyed instance: 38\".\nI`ve seen and other behaviour(but probably due to network misconfig) when compute node actually terminate instance, but nova-api (euca-describe-instances) continue to \"run\" or \"terminating\" it and you can again and again euca-terminate it without errors but with no effect - reboot all nodes(possibly not network) helped.\n\nTry to describe reproducing - get working cloud (cactus release), start an instance, see when it goes, than  can do this:\nstop networking on compute(or just physically eject interfaces, both if any), on that node by terminal stop nova-compute, then destroy VM domain, on api node issue euca-terminate instance. Euca-describe will be \"terminating\" state untill not restore networking on compute and start nova-compute on it. Then instance looks ended, but its files remain.\nYou may do the same by just destroying virsh VM domain, when nova-compute stopped(and the euca-terminate issued) - no need to manipulate network.\n\nAll I want to say - that nova-compute has to somehow register or check which files it has put in /var/lib/nova/instances, including _base dir, are they  synced with real situation, running instances and downloaded image cache(may be unsynced too) or not exactly. May be a transaction, which check files also, when get terminate from nova-api and reporting terminate state from compute like \"already terminated\" . Or some \"hash\" of cached images like simply filesize, which checked before actually run an instance from it (can emulate by replace for example cached kernel image with any file but the same name, for sample zero size)\n\nActually somewhen you`ld need feature like auto clearing cache of images cause none of servers has endless memory, while at production farm very many different VMs can run on the same node during long period of time.\n\nThanks for your attention!",
