            "content": "I don't see any exact duplicates of code here.\n\nThere is similar code to the change in question in the manager detach function: https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py#L4633\n\nThere is also some duplication of exceptions raised in the attach function:\nhttps://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/master/nova/compute/manager.py#L4622\n\nThe _shutdown_instance performs a volume_api detach without a virt_driver detach, this is a similar code path to the change that was made, but without the option to also perform a virt_driver attach.\n\nI agree that this code could use some clean up. Currently the driver_bdm dict is used as an API only in the attach case. The code for detach still lives entirely in the manager object.  There is still some code in the manager attach function that probably belongs in the driver_bdm object. (Such as a call to volume_api.unreserve). Oddly the reserve call is made at the API layer, but if we are unreserving on error, might as well do it in the bdm object.\n\nBecause attaching / detaching from an instance is separate from attaching / detaching in the volume_api (cinder) it might make sense to refactor some bdm functions that just do this and are used by higher level functions that also perform the volume_api check_attach / attach  code.",

            "content": "Belive that for now this is invalid. There is code that is superficially similar between the 'detach' code in manager.py and the block_device attach function, but there are subtle differences. The code in manager.py calls roll_detach on failure, which I believe is inappropriate for the block_device.py attach function. There isn't an easy way to re-use this code without a much larger re-factor.",
