    "description": "The idea is that we don't want people to have to pass all possible quantum port attributes (IPs, security groups, etc.) in through nova. So instead, if they want something other than a \"default\" port, a tenant (or code acting on behalf of the tenant) would create a port with those settings and pass it to Nova.\n\nSo I think ideally we'd change the request_networks extension to take port-id rather than individual attributes like IP-address. This would keep the quantum code in nova really simple, which is ideal. It would make thinks slightly more complicated if you're using the nova + quantum clients, but with Horizon, or with a joint openstack client, it could be a simple workflow.\n\nbased on discussion of \nhttps://review.openstack.org/#/c/9506/",

Am I just looking in the wrong place? \n\nMy understanding was that this functionality was a poorly documented part of the os-createserverext extension that was implemented right in code with the official server stuff.  See discussion here:  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/10435/ .   It wasn't even supported in the nova client until I added the --nic option a while back.  \n\n",
