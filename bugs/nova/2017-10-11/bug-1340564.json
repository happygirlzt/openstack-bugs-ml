    "description": "When 10 user starts to provision VMs to a VCenter, OpenStack chooses one same datastore for everyone.\nAfter the first clone task is complete, OpenStack recognizes that datastore space usage is increased, and will choose another datastore. However, all the next 9 provision tasks are still performed on the same datastore. If no provision task on one datastore completes, OpenStack will persist to choose that datastore to spawn next VMs.\n\nThis bug has significant performance impact, because it slows down performance of all the provisioning tasks greatly. VCenter driver should choose a not busy datastore for the provisioning tasks.",
