    "description": "When the nova ironic driver makes ironic client calls, it currently gets a brand new client for each call. This can be done more efficiently by caching the client and re-authenticating as needed (e.g., when the auth token expires). With recent changes to the driver to cleanup the retry logic, this should be easier to do. [1][2] The driver class can contain a single IronicClientWrapper reference to use for the client calls, and the IronicClientWrapper object can handle caching and reauthenticating as needed.\n\n[1] https://review.openstack.org/83105\n[2] https://review.openstack.org/86993",
