If that fails then attempt\n    to use the value that is in the instances 'availability_zone'\n    key instead.\n    \n    For the caching used in the availability_zones module there\n    was a new method added to get and reset the cache that is\n    useful for unit tests, since during each run of a test you\n    do not want to be affected by something in cache from a previous\n    test.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1172246\n    \n    Change-Id: I6f54a44cc87434120656ccc789cebcc08d434418\n",
