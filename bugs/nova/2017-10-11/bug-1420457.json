But this code is only used to verify if a VPN connection is listening, there is no session exposed from this.  In other words this code is used for a boolean response and therefore exposes no security vulnerability that I can see.  I do agree that the code could be rewritten a bit to document why the random session is fine, and actually return a boolean rather than a session, but as it's used now I see nothing that warrants keeping this bug as private.",
