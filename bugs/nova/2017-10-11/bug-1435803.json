    "description": "Some compute manager tests that exercise the exception behavior of methods combined with using a somewhat real instance parameter when doing so take very long time to complete. This happens if the method being tested has the @revert_task_state decorator because it will try to update the instance using a conductor call when there is no conductor service listening.\n\nBy setting the conductor use_local flag for those tests I am able to reduce the total test time with 4 full minutes when run locally.",
