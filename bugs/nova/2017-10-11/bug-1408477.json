As libvirt is the\n    component that's doing the heavy lifting under the hood. These\n    logs gives us detailed interactions between libvirt and QEMU on\n    source and destination Compute nodes. To enable:\n\n     1. In /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf, have these two config attributes:\n\n        . . .\n        log_filters=\"1:libvirt 1:qemu 1:conf 1:security 3:event 3:json 3:file 1:util\"\n        log_outputs=\"1:file:/var/tmp/libvirtd.log\"\n        . . .\n\n       NOTE: Do *not* forget to turn off this debugging control once the\n       test is finished.\n  \n     2. Restart libvirtd:\n\n        $ systemctl restart libvirtd\n\n     3. Repeat the test.\n\n     4. Capture the libvirt logs and attach them as plain text to the  bug.",
