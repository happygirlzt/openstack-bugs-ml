    "description": "When the XenAPI Glance plugin encounters a retryable error, it logs a message stating that it is retrying the action. This was added when retries were only implemented on uploads, but the retry logic was later moved up a level to be usable for all glance plugin functions. I've noticed that the messages logged indicate they will retry vhd_upload regardless of the Glance plugin function actually being used, most obvious during a vhd_download:\n\nDec 30 19:22:42  DEBUG nova.virt.xenapi.client.session Got exception: ['XENAPI_PLUGIN_FAILURE', 'signal: SIGTERM', '', ''] _unwrap_plugin_exceptions /nova/virt/xenapi/client/session.py:249\n\nDec 30 19:22:42  DEBUG nova.virt.xenapi.client.session  Error due to a signal, retrying upload_vhd _is_retryable_exception /nova/virt/xenapi/client/session.py:232\n\nDec 30 19:22:42  WARNING nova.virt.xenapi.client.session  glance.download_vhd failed. Retrying call.\n\nDec 30 19:22:42  INFO nova.virt.xenapi.client.session glance.download_vhd attempt 2/6\n\nThis example was in a Rackspace environment, so I have redacted a few things from the logs, but the issue is clear and easily reproducible. For this test I built a new instance, logged into the host that the build started on, and killed the glance process with a SIGTERM so it would retry and log the message. I've confirmed that the issue in the code is still present in the current trunk in GitHub. \n\nThis will be trivial to fix and I plan to assign this bug to myself and submit the code patch. Essentially, my proposed solution is to add an optional argument to _is_retryable_exception() to specify the function, and then reference that if it is set or use a generic message otherwise.",
