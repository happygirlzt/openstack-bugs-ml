You should write a blueprint for nova that adds the HGST libvirt volume driver shim and your blueprint should depend on blueprint use-os-brick-library - there are others already doing this today for liberty that have specs.  I'm not sure you need a spec for this since it's pretty mechanical, but you should have a blueprint, it's definitely not a bug.",
