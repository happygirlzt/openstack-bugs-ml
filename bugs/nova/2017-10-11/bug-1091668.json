M. Rodrigues <email address hidden>\nDate:   Mon Jan 21 12:39:47 2013 -0500\n\n    Fix get Floating ip pools action name to match with its policy\n    \n    Get Floating IP Pools is always responding 403 (Forbidden) cause its method\n    name, which is also being used as action name, doesn't match with the name in\n    policy.json file.\n    I opted for this approach cause it also fixes the different names between the\n    extension (which is named floating **ip** pools instead of floating pools) and\n    the backend.\n    Another good practice would be change the default_floating_pool option to\n    default_float_ip_pool, but that would require change the conf file and possibly\n    break some compatibility.\n    \n    Fixes bug 1091668\n    \n    Change-Id: I2627e8b0f45c5c39bbbf1a4a12b448e1992fa4b4\n",
