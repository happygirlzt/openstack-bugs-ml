This code is arguably Nova specific\n        and doesn't really belong in openstack-common's generic logging\n        configuration.\n    \n        Additionally, This code was actually removing the root logger used\n    by\n        some command line tools and binaries and hiding log messages that\n    should\n        have otherwise gone to the console.\n    \n        Fixes LP Bug #1029577.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ic6a6862e5bc357846bf3202186c7e24622d3bb87\n",
