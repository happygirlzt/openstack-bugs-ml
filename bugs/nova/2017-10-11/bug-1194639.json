    "description": "The VNC proxy to host link should be authenticated.  As it currently stands, if some malicious entity managed to get into an OpenStack cloud's internal network, they could simply connect using their VNC client of choice to any compute host node at ports 5900, 5901, etc an get access to the VMs.  This is not desirable.  In situations where a Kerberos installation is available, the link between the proxy and the host should be protected by Kerberos.",
