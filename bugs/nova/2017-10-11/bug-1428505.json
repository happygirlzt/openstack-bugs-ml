The issue is that\n    unexpected instance reboots are not handled at all.\n    \n    After an instance is stopped, suspended or paused, the console log\n    workers are stopped as well as the serial console pipe is closed.\n    Those workers are never restarted unless a power change is triggered\n    by the manager.\n    \n    This patch proposes an instance state event listener, emiting events\n    that can be handled by the manager, similar to the Libvirt driver\n    workflow.\n    \n    Change-Id: Ia0a875707a7a37224efb333feab1503e83449cc4\n    Closes-Bug: #1428505\n",
