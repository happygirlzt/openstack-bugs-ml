    "description": "Release: diablo\nI'm using ec2 availability zones to allocate instances and volumes as close as possible. And when I tried to create volume in specific availability zone, nova completely ignores -z flag. I dug into code and found that 'availability_zone' value just thrown away. Since this use-case is important for our business, i'm tried to fix this bug in-place.\n\nConfiguration of nova installation:\n1 controller-node (api, scheduler, network)\n2 compute-volume nodes with  distinct availability zones (--storage_availability_zone flag set)\nScheduler driver - ZoneScheduler\n\nFirst, I have patched ec2 api handler and added 'availability_zone' into parameter list for volume_api.create() call (nova/api/ec2/cloud.py:1006), then added this parameter into rpc call to scheduler (nova/volume/api.py:97) and finally fixed nova-volume manager, which doesn't expect 'availability_zone' in argument list (nova/volume/manager.py:96). After restart of nova services i checked volume creation and it works as intended.\n\nPatch included.",
