This could\n    cause the placement engine to return that provider record, even though\n    the compute node no longer exists. And since the periodic \"healing\" by\n    the resource tracker only updates compute node resources for records in\n    the compute_nodes table, these old records are never removed.\n    \n    This patch adds a call to delete the resource provider when the compute\n    node is deleted. It also adds a method to the scheduler report client\n    to make these calls to the placement API.\n    \n    Partial-Bug: #1661258\n    Closes-Bug: #1661014\n    \n    Change-Id: I6098d186d05ff8b9a568e23f860295a7bc2e6447\n",
