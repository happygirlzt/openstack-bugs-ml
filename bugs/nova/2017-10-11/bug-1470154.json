    "description": "Nova's List-based objects have something called child_versions, which is a naive mapping of the objects field and the version relationships between the list object and the content object. This was created before we generalized the work in obj_relationships, which normal objects now use. The list-based objects still use child_versions, which means we need a separate test and separate developer behaviors when updating these.\n\nFor consistency, we should replace child_versions on all the list objects with obj_relationships, remove the list-specific test in test_objects.py, and make sure that the generalized tests properly cover list objects and relationships between list and non-list objects.",

This\n    change moves over all list classes to use obj_relationships (and\n    therefore are now tested in test_relationships() with all other\n    objects).\n    \n    Change-Id: I334dba243de45bf11ccb5ab55e2aa8390fe9d8c2\n    Closes-Bug: #1470154\n",
