This works fine in those situations where the requested URL actually includes the '/' but in some situations it can be easy to not include it. If, for example, the API is mounted under a prefix like '/placement' (as in the default devstack setup) then it is possible to make a request to http://example.com/placement and get a 404 whereas http://example.com/placement/ will get the expected microversion information.\n\nThis ought to be easy to fix and was basically an oversight.",

In\n    the context of having a prefix, we'd generally like the latter to\n    work and for '/' to work when there is no prefix. This allows both.\n    \n    Note that this doesn't make /placement/resource_providers/ work, and\n    we don't want that.\n    \n    Change-Id: I0ac92bf9982227d5f4915175182e5230aeb039b4\n    Closes-Bug: #1626490\n",
