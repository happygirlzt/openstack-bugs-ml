So nova shall not send instance.delete notification in this case. \n\nIn the patch there was a discussion about sending instance.evacuate.end but that was already sent when the instance successfully evacuated to the target host. \n\nThe action what happens here is just nova internal cleanup. So I'm not sure why you need an external notification about it.\n\nCould you please state your use case that needs this notification?",
