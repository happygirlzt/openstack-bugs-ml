That means if there is no metadata associated to a host, the loop won't start and the function will return True --> this host will pass. Moreover, if the HA metadata has only a partial set of the image properties, and matches the values, the function will also return True.\n\nWhat you are expecting is a filter which rejects every host which doesn't match ALL the image properties. Please, take a look to this: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/aggregate-extra-specs-filter\n\nI'm going to ask to Nova:scheduler admins if this filter should be changed (but I don't think so, the change proposed by you is not backwards compatible with existing configurations).",

The filter actually only compares aggregate metadata if and only if the metadata keys are prefixed by the namespace and the separator defined by config options aggregate_image_properties_isolation_namespace and aggregate_image_properties_isolation_separator. If the host has no metadata attached to the aggregate it belongs to, or if the aggregate has metadata that is not prefixed by the CONF values, then the host is considered valid. This is not a strict enforcement.\n\nSee https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/5dbdd6ed2bdcb6e52189e824b3526dde109be017/nova/scheduler/filters/aggregate_image_properties_isolation.py#L44-L47\n\nSo, please reply to this to giving us :\n - the destination aggregate metadata\n - CONF.aggregate_image_properties_isolation_namespace value\n - CONF.aggregate_image_properties_isolation_separator value\n",
