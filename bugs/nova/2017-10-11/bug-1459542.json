    "description": "In the current \"resize instance\" implementation, if a instance is booted from volume, it is allowed to be resize down.\n\nBut there are two problems:\n\n1. The current implementation allows resize down with a flavor with smaller 'root_gb' than the volume the instance\nbooted from. This will cause differences between the actual 'root_gb' size and the one recorded in the data base. \nWe shouldn't allow resize down with flavor has less 'root_gb' than the volume.\n\n2. Check if the instance is booted from volume in driver.py is a bad implementation, we should perform it in API layer.",
