We had removed\n    uuidutils.generate_uuid() in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/60643/\n    It seems the UUID test was not executed, for example, there is no method\n    called generate_uuid() in common/utils, the Jekins still passed. This\n    patch move the testcase and remove the test method for generate_uuid.\n    \n    Change-Id: If4f508129f0b44d63fe77ed1251c0e0737e7e897\n    Partial-Bug: #1253497\n",
