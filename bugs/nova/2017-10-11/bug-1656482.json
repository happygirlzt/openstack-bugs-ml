However\n    the REST API handler code is simply parsing and passing the\n    member_of values through to the object code which is doing a\n    SQL IN statement which will result in no resource providers if\n    an invalidate aggregate uuid is provided, i.e. not actually a\n    uuid.\n    \n    This patch adds simple uuid validation to the handler code\n    that's parsing the member_of query parameter.\n    \n    Change-Id: I912f731e0d75979aea0a0f22c15e6cfb84a95050\n    Closes-Bug: #1656482\n",
