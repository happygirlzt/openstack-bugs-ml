Helps avoid the need to call into the manager just to be stopped\n       by the lock there\n    2. Returns a failure to the user right away when an operation cannot\n       be completed due to the lock\n    3. Avoids the potential for task_state to get into an unhappy state\n       because a user unknowingly attempts an action whilst an instance\n       is locked\n    4. Avoids the manager from having to re-do the lock check by\n       stuffing a flag into RequestContext when the check has already\n       been done by api.py\n    \n    Various tests needed to be fixed up in order to pass fake instances\n    with the locked attribute. We could make the decorator ignore\n    instances without it, but I think it's more explicit to push that\n    requirement into the tests.\n    \n    This fixes bug 872541\n    \n    Change-Id: I1127e31d86a061a93a64ee1eb4a4d900d8bf49b5\n",
