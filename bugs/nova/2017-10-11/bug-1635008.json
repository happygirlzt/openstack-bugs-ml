The auth config logic\n    is mingling both backends which is really confusing.\n    \n    For example, the iscsi protocol only defines auth_method,\n    auth_username and auth_password. It does not set an\n    auth_enabled value in the connection_info['data'] dict.\n    \n    This change simplifies the logic involved for setting\n    the auth config by decoupling the rbd/iscsi handlers.\n    \n    A follow-up change will build on this to fix the\n    rbd auth config to prefer the cinder volume connection_info\n    auth data over the local config for nova in the case\n    that different cinder backends are used for ephemeral\n    and block storage.\n    \n    Change-Id: I8a55d87f75ecad757ce81b1f5f77c3a551154a17\n    Partial-Bug: #1635008\n",

            "content": "I've already posted this comment on Github, so I hope it's okay to double-post it here, as in retrospect this might be the better forum.\n\nThe upgrade note in the patch states that the setting in cinder.conf will be \"pulled\" and take precedence over the rbd_user etc. from nova.conf. I'm not sure that this is strictly true. Am I right in thinking that the credentials are (and always have been) pulled from the cinder.conf at volume creation time, and that this metadata is stored in the block_device_mapping table in the nova database?\n\nIf I'm right then a user that has pre-existing volumes, who previously omitted ceph credentials from their cinder.conf will not have any credentials stored in block_device_mapping (presumably the source of connection_info).\n\nI myself have ended up with incomplete credentials stored in block_device_mapping. This is due to my use of Ubuntu's cinder-ceph juju charms, so this is not an isolated case. The juju charms write the rbd user, but not the secret_uuid to the cinder.conf on the cinder-api nodes.\n\nWhen I initially investigated the issue that this patch addresses, on an unpatched Liberty, I tried adding the ceph credentials to the cinder.conf on my compute hosts, and removed the credentials in nova.conf. The result was that a \"null\" secret uuid was pulled from the database, and the volume did not work. The secret uuid in my cinder.conf was ignored at this point.\n\nTo retrospectively fix this problem for myself, I ran the following SQL update:\nupdate block_device_mapping set connection_info = REPLACE(connection_info,'\"secret_uuid\": null','\"secret_uuid\": \"62003c88-92c4-4986-92a2-7f9245ed3bb7\"') WHERE connection_info LIKE '%\"secret_uuid\": null%cinder-ceph%';\n(cinder-ceph was the name of my pool)\n\nCan anyone confirm that changes (not obvious in this patch) have been made that will pull the credentials from cinder.conf when they are absent in the block_device_mapping table (connection_info)?\n\nIf those credentials are not pulled from cinder.conf at run-time, then lots of rbd volumes might fail when the legacy nova.conf settings are pulled in the 'P' release.\n\nThanks,\nJohn",
