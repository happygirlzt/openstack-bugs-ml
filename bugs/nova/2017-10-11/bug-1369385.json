The scheduler selected a host,\nsay it's  'host2', but the host2's hypervisor has some problems and failed to boot the instance. Then scheduler retry to boot the instance. Scheduler failed to select host for the instance. As the group with affinity request boot instance to host2 but host2 is not OK.\n\nFor this case, it's not make sense that the group affinity policy take effect when the first instance in the group is retrying to create.",

To the end user, the server group is  actually no instance(or host).\nRetry should pick up another host to boot instance and take the new host as group host.\n\nFailed to boot the first instance in the group doesn't make sense.",
