The reason for this from the legacy code is that authenticate was constructed to verify aws signatures and unfortunately s3 uses a completely different method for signing requests.  Authenticate returns the proper user and project but does NOT currently check the signature for objectstore requests.\n\nAuthorize may need to reworked a bit because it needs a little more data for the s3 version, like content-type and md5.
