This can result in data\n    loss in the case of VMware driver since the instance\n    VM is not re-configured to remove volume's vmdk. Also,\n    the connection won't be terminated if attach fails.\n    This patch fixes the above issues with cleanup during\n    Cinder attach failure.\n    \n    Closes-bug: #1460044\n    Change-Id: I62c0800f68d8fd89fed98eea9e3f95d1adbe9d7f\n",
