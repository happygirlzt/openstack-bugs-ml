We want to use Ironic to include bare metal applications as part of our cloud orchestration strategy. Instance metadata / Cloud-init is a core component to having unified orchestration across bare metal and virtualized applications. I went and tracked down how instance metadata works with Neutron today with virtual machines. It looks like the basic hook to redirect virtual machine requests to http://169.254.169.254 to the neutron-metadata-agent relies on a process running on the host OS (libvirt) of the compute node that the virtual machine is running on. See:\nhttps://answers.launchpad.net/neutron/+question/240269 for details. \n\nA bare metal node that has booted will not be able to use this hook since it is not running on a hypervisor with a host OS and libvirt. So what's the fix for bare metal nodes with Ironic? Am I missing something?",
