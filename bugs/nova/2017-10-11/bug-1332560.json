    "description": "When an instance is created using boot from volume, boot from image(creates a new volume) or boot from volume snapshot(creates a new volume), and after creating image snapshot from this instance an image of 0 bytes is created which is neither public nor protected and have no format defined.\n\nSteps to reproduce using Horizon:\n\nCase 1: Boot instance from volume\n\n1. Go to Project --> Compute --> Volumes and click on 'Create Volume'.\n2. Provide volume name, Size and select 'Image' from 'Volume Source' drop-down and an image from 'Use image as a source' drop-down.\n3. Click on 'Create Volume' button and a bootable volume will be created.\n4. Go to Project --> Compute --> Instances and click on 'Launch Instance' button from the top right.\n5. Provide instance name, select 'Boot from volume' as 'Instance Boot Source' and a bootable volume as 'volume'.\n6. Click on 'Launch' button.\n7. You will be redirected to instance list page.\n8. Click on 'Create Snapshot' to create a snapshot of this instance.\n9. In this case a new image of 0 bytes and a volume snapshot will be created.\n10. You will be redirected to image list where you will see a new image created with 0 bytes.\n11. Neither this image is public nor protected.\n12. No format is defined for this image.\n\nCase 2: Boot instance from image(creates a new volume)\n\n1. Go to Project --> Compute --> Instances and click on 'Launch Instance' button from the top right.\n2. Provide instance name, select 'Boot from image(creates a new volume)' as 'Instance Boot Source' and an image from the drop-down.\n3. Click on 'Launch' button.\n4. A new volume will be created and will be attached to this instance.\n5. You will be redirected to instance list page.\n6. Click on 'Create Snapshot' to create a snapshot of this instance.\n7. In this case a new image of 0 bytes and a volume snapshot will be created.\n8. You will be redirected to image list where you will see a new image created with 0 bytes.\n9. Neither this image is public nor protected.\n10. No format is defined for this image.\n\nCase 3: Boot instance from volume snapshot(creates a new volume)\n\n1. Go to Project --> Compute --> volumes and click on 'Create Volume' button.\n2. Create a bootable volume same as case 1.\n3. From volumes list page you will see 'more' button with respect to each volume.\n4. Click on 'more', a drop-down will open, select 'Create Snapshot' from this drop-down.\n5. A snapshot will be created for this volume.\n6. Go to Project --> Compute --> Instances and click on 'Launch Instance' button from the top right.\n7. Provide instance name, select 'Boot from image(creates a new volume)' as 'Instance Boot Source' and an image from the drop-down.\n8. Click on 'Launch' button.\n9. A new volume will be created and will be attached to this instance.\n10. You will be redirected to instance list page.\n11. Click on 'Create Snapshot' to create a snapshot of this instance.\n12. In this case a new image of 0 bytes and a volume snapshot will be created.\n13. You will be redirected to image list where you will see a new image created with 0 bytes.\n14. Neither this image is public nor protected.\n15. No format is defined for this image.",

It is mentioned that the new image is simply a bucket of properties (particularly the block device mapping, kernel and ramdisk IDs) with no image data, so I think this is the reason for no image format here.
