That makes hotplugging a no-go, so I don't think that this is really a volumes and hotplug bug, but rather something else.\r\n\r\nCan you confirm that virsh dumpxml of your instance shows only IDE controllers? Are you using any metadata on your image that would cause libvirt to use IDE?",

I think we agree that /dev/hdX (emulated as IDE) is not hot-pluggable. /dev/vdX is hot-pluggable and is even used for the initially specified instance disks.\n\nWhen I specify a new volume to attach after the host is running, no matter what device string I give, it gets translated to /dev/hdX by openstack. I should be able to specify /dev/vdb and /dev/vdb should make it all the way through to KVM. Somewhat beside the point but related, adding a device should probably default to /dev/vdX instead of /dev/hdX if there needs to be some form of default for KVM.",
